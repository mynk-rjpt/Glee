Speed Reading,"Speed Reading Information  Introduction Speed reading is a collection of reading methods which attempt to increase rates of reading without greatly reducing comprehension or retention. Methods include chunking and eliminating subvocalization. No absolute distinct ""normal"" and ""speed-reading"" types of reading exist in practice, since all readers use some of the techniques used in speed reading (such as identifying words without focusing on each letter, not sounding out all words, not sub-vocalizing some phrases, or spending less time on some phrases than others, and skimming small sections). Speed reading is characterized by an analysis of trade-offs between measures of speed and comprehension, recognizing that different types of reading call for different speed and comprehension rates, and that those rates may be improved with practice. There are many programs available that teach different fundamentals, while some are better than others. 

Speed reading is helpful at home, in the office and in the classroom. Most speed reading programs teach simple techniques that help aspiring speed readers better focus their concentration, limit their eye movements and other factors. 

Speed reading requires retraining the brain to more efficiently process words. Good reading skills are a prerequisite to successfully learn speed reading. Experts warn that speed reading techniques will not benefit someone who has poor reading comprehension or vocabulary problems. 

Anyone with good reading skills can very quickly learn to improve their speed. But experts warn that becoming a dedicated speed reader with good comprehension takes much practice and concentration. 
Learning To Speed Read Here are some of the basic steps to learning speed reading: 

Start by timing your current reading speed. Knowing your base speed will allow you to gauge improvements in your reading time and thus keep you motivated during your studies. You can time yourself by taking one of the many reading tests that are available online. Or you can simply track your reading speed with a watch, a cooking timer or even the timer on your cell phone. 

Before starting your speed reading practice sessions, clear the area of all potential distractions. Turn off any music, switch off the TV and unplug the telephone. Find a place, even just a room, where you can be alone to practice speed reading. Make sure you are seated comfortably in a quiet site. This will let your mind focus solely on reading. 

Adjust your desired reading speed to the materials you have chosen to read. Try to match your ability to comprehend to your reading speed. 

Learn to take advantage of skimming to quicken your reading pace. Identify important materials and sentences that are vital to comprehension from the non-vital information in the document. Rapidly skim over the less important words and sentences. Train yourself to find key words. Read those key words and then merely skim the rest of the material. 

Develop a wider eye-span with “chunking.” Chunking is reading blocks of words or blocks of sentences at a glance to quicken reading speed. Practice reading blocks of words or sentences at one time rather than reading each word or sentence individually. Limit the left-to-right movements of your eyes by gradually increasing the number of words you read at a glance with chunking. 

Strive to shorten your “fixation” time. That is the length of time needed to read each block of words or each block of sentences. Practice is necessary to cut your fixation time, according to speed reading experts. 

Refrain from re-reading sentences and passages. Many people are in the habit of re-reading portions of the text. Break this habit to quicken your reading speed. 

Some experts contend that you should not subvocalize while practicing speed reading. Subvocalization is described as internal speech where readers imagine the sounds of the words they are reading. 

Use your fingers and hands to keep your eyes focused on the appropriate places on the page. This will also help you avoid making mistakes. 

Regularly practice your speed reading. Focus on pushing yourself to read faster and better. Always strive to reach a higher level in your speed reading studies. Time yourself frequently. Chart your improvements. 
Helpful Hints Speed reading experts offer these useful tips to help you get the most out of your practice sessions and more quickly increase your reading speed: Select reading materials with a large font for your practice sessions. The larger type will help you stay focused. 

Stop “eye rests.” Eye rests are the split second pauses that you make while reading a document. Your eyes are moving down the line while reading, but the eyes will stop on a word several times per line before resuming reading. First works on reducing the number of eye rests, and then try to eliminate them. Keep your eyes moving methodically line-by-line without stopping? 

Choose materials that you have previously read when making a selection for your practice sessions. You can focus better on your speed when you are reading a book or article that you already know, according to experts. Or at least choose a topic that you’re already familiar with. Then you can add new materials and new topics as a challenge after your reading speed improves. 

Read the table of contents before speed reading a book. Check out the back cover. It helps to know a bit about the book before speed reading. Experts recommend briefly perusing the material before you start reading to learn the gist of the document and to familiarize yourself with the writer’s style. 

Choose topics that you are interested in reading about. This helps focus your concentration on what you’re reading. Your attention might wander if you’re bored with a topic, and you’ll then waste time re-reading that part of the document. 

Decide what information you are seeking from a document before starting to read. If you only want a summary on a certain topic, you can skim the materials for the essential information. But if you need to fathom the details of a complicated subject, you will likely need to read slower to attain the necessary level of comprehension. 

Adapt the reading pace to your purpose and the type of material you are reading. Difficult, technical data will likely require a slower reading rate than easy, non-complicated material. 

Choose newspapers or magazines with narrow columns of text when practicing chunking. The narrow columns are helpful when learning how to read blocks of words and blocks of sentences at a glance. 

Start slowly when using your fingers or hands to guide the eyes. This will help hone your speed reading skills and eventually quicken your pace. 

Some practicing speed readers find that it is faster to guide their eyes with an index card, a piece of folded paper or a bookmark rather than using their fingers or hands as a guide. 

Take breaks at regular intervals when practicing speed reading. Research shows that efficiency suffers with uninterrupted reading. Frequent breaks help clear the mind and refresh you up so that you’re better able to learn. Some experts suggest taking a five-minute break every hour to allow for better comprehension and ultimately faster reading. 

Establish a time goal when speed reading a book. Determine how fast you want to read it and then push yourself to meet that goal. 

Strike a good balance between your reading speed and comprehension level. Try to quicken your reading pace while also understanding the contents of the document. 
Speed Reading Exercises There are many helpful exercises that beginning speed readers can use to read even faster. Beginners can find speed reading exercises online or buy computer programs that teach speed reading. Other options for learning to speed read are reading books on the topic or taking classes online or in person. 

Some of the most common speed reading exercises involve practicing chunking or eliminating subvocalizing while reading. 

One way for the novice speed-reader to eradicate subvocalizing is to practice reading on a conscious level, according to experts. This eliminates excessive subvocalizing and increases reading pace, according to those experts. 

Another speed reading exercise involves establishing a rhythm by reading at a set pace. 
Self-Pacing Techniques Experts point to five self-pacing techniques that are helpful when learning to speed read. Accomplished readers should increase their reading speeds relatively quickly with these techniques, although several practice sessions are needed before the readers will feel comfortable with a particular method, according to experts. Beginning speed readers should try all five methods and then concentrate on the technique they feel most comfortable using. 

Sit erect when practicing these techniques. Hold the reading material down on a flat surface with your left hand and use your right hand for a pacing guide. Left-handed students should do the opposite. Lefties should hold the reading material down with their right hand and use the left hand for pacing. 

• Card Pacing Technique - Use a card or a folded sheet of paper as a blocker while reading. Place the blocker card above the printed line and use it to block those words after you’ve read them. Drag the blocker steadily down the page at a slow pace and attempt to read the words before they vanish beneath the blocker card. Drag the card down quicker than you believe you can read. Experts contend this technique cures the reader’s natural tendency to re-read passages. 

• Hand Pacing Technique – Put your right hand on the written page and slowly drag it straight down the page while drawing your eyes down simultaneously as you read. Maintain a slow, steady pace and follow with your eyes. Practicing this motion will eventually allow you to pick up the pace and read faster. Don’t pause while reading. 

• Sweep Pacing Technique- Use your hand’s motion to draw your eyes across the written page. Begin by cupping your right hand while keeping the fingers together. Fluidly sweep your fingers from left to right while underling the line of text with the tip of your middle finger. Move your entire arm while using the sweep pacing method. The sweeping motion should mimic the movement you would make while dusting something off the page, according to experts. 

• Hop Pacing Technique – This technique is similar to the sweep method. Raise your fingers and make two evenly placed hops or bounces on each line. Each hop or bounce will include a block of words. Maintain a steady pace. Move your entire arm and not just the wrist. 

• Zig-zag Pacing Technique (also known as the loop pacing technique) – This method involves scanning. Slide your hand diagonally across approximately three lines of text, and then glide back to the next line. The aim is to scan the text and focus on the main ideas rather than reading word-for-word. Experts say this technique is best reserved for simple reading material and not for material that need careful study. 
Traits That Reduce Reading Speed Experts blame 11 habits or traits for slowing an individual’s reading speed. These include: 

• Reading each individual word. • Tardy perceiving and responding to reading materials. • Inaccurate eye movements across a page of text. • Reading out loud. • Needless or unrealized re-reading. • Poor attention and concentration. • Too little reading experience. • Fear of losing reading comprehension. • Habitual slow reading. • Attempting to remember everything rather than choosing what is important enough to retain. • Faulty decision of which data is important and which is not. 
Conclusion Beginners adopting speed reading as a hobby will be rewarded with a skill that will improve their private, professional and academic lives. 

A book enthusiast who learns to read faster will find time to peruse many more volumes during leisure time. A news junkie who speed reads can consume many additional newspapers, magazines and online sites. 

Speed reading can also be applied to the business world. Speed readers can read more data on the job, thus increasing their productivity. 

Students will also benefit from the ability to speed read. Speed reading will enable them to wade through the required reading material quicker and finish their assignments faster. 

Other benefits of speed reading include the ability to amass more knowledge and the ability to browse large amounts of data. 

Many people enjoy speed reading both as a hobby and as a professional or intellectual advantage. Some of the hobby’s aficionados converge for the annual World Championship Speed Reading Competition. 

Speed reading is a general term that refers to various methods aimed at increasing speed without unduly sacrificing comprehension or retention. 

A beginner interested in speed reading can choose among many learning options. He or she can enroll in a commercial reading program, buy special computer software, take a speed reading class in person or online, or learn the hobby from a book. 

Good reading skills are necessary in order to successfully practice speed reading. Experts caution that you can’t learn to read faster if you can’t read well at a normal pace.",
Karate,"Karate Information  Introduction Many people are introduced to Karate by lavish displays, competitions, or movie fight scenes. Bricks and boards are broken by hand to demonstrate the awesome power behind the art form. However, scholars and true followers of Karate know a different side. 

To get a clear concept of this martial art, one must examine its origin and the people that helped create it. A simple translation of Karate means “empty hand.” Thus you have the people who say it refers to a weaponless fighting style. Despite the fact this is a true statement, it is a poor translation. 

By studying Buddhist teachings, one will discover there is much more to the concept of “emptiness” than what is found in Western thought. The eastern way of thought says that emptiness is a transcendence of all things. It is like a mirror which can reflect all things, but remains free of all things. 

Additionally, Karate itself is not a true martial art, since that denotes it’s to be used for war or violence. Rather it is a physical expression which allows people to find themselves by immersing themselves in its art. 
Schools of Thought
Brief Explanation With the vast array of styles and types of Karate, it might be hard to select one over another. As a way to guide people in their approach to understanding Karate, the two major schools of thought will be discussed instead. These schools are Shuri-te and Naha-te.  
Suri-te Suri-te is one of the largest classifications of Karate. It is characterized by straight movements and lines to the forms of Kata it employees. Feet move in a straight pattern and the breathing is natural. 

Given these characteristics it is often done with more speed than the other school of thought known as Naha-te. Shuri-te is further broken down into three categories, which can be better grasped once a person is involved in the art.  
Naha-te Where Shuri-te is fast, Naha-te is more balanced and powerful. The katas it employees follow a curved line rather than straight. The breathing techniques are not natural. Instead, they are practiced and controlled. Many times they are assigned to specific moves. 

Naha-te is further broken up into two smaller categories. Again, this is only better understood by the practitioner of the art and will not be covered here. 
Katas
What is a Kata? In many martial arts, Katas are used in training. A Kata is an arrangement of preset movements that utilize the techniques taught by the instructor. Blocks, punches, and kicks, are all tied together in these styles for all levels of the form. 

Katas will teach the technique of the move as well as allow the practitioner to immerse themselves in the movement. This is a crucial element in Karate. Over the centuries, katas have been practiced and refined. The goal of this is to find the ultimate form of expression. 

Katas will use a variety of movements that are scientifically based to give the maximum channel of power. By combining physical strength with speed and balance, these moves have the potential to break boards and bricks. The use of these objects to break is a clear indication on how well you’ve mastered the katas. 

On a more philosophic note, katas are seen as natural movements of the body. The beginning stance and ending stance are typically identical. This promotes the beliefs of coincidental movements. This further validates the natural state of each position used. 
Kumite
What is Kumite? Aside from kata, the other traditionally accepted form of Karate is kumite. This is a free style format which can utilize the moves taught in the kata forms. Kumite is the style used when two practitioners are pitted against each other at the same time. 

Unlike the kata element of Karate, Kumite concentrates the training of endurance and physical power of the body. This is not to say the spiritual elements are not a factor, rather their role is more subtle. 
Elements of training For those interested in the physical benefits of Karate, there are certain criteria instructors will work with you on. The following discusses each of these areas in more detail. It should be noted that this section is focused more on the physical side of Karate. It should not be taken as the only thing trained in Karate.  
Form & Balance Many moves executed in Karate require keeping your balance. Kicks often leave the practitioner standing only on one foot. An instructor will look to improve how you carry yourself and improve you through the forms and training. 

A high center of gravity will give you a greater deal of speed. Your feet are closer together allowing for a quicker response. Although it is beneficial to have speed in the art, this will cost a price. You will have less stability and therefore less power in your strikes. 

A lower center of gravity gives that stability allowing for more force to be put behind a punch or kick. This in turn sacrifices speed. Since your feet must be farter apart, it makes it difficult to respond. 

By balancing your center of gravity, it is possible to achieve the desired outcome. This outcome is a full expression of power and energy. This also provides the ground work needed to progress through the natural movements of Karate.  
Speed vs. Power A constant balancing act is being perfected when dealing with power and speed. The blending of both these elements is what gives the destructive force that is displayed when breaking a board. 

The speed at which you kick or punch will amplify the force you exert when striking. However, the more speed you add tends to sacrifice the amount of force that can be used. 

On the other end of the scale, if you add more power you’ll most likely sacrifice speed. Karate looks to find the best movements to combine these two factors together. This is why so many moves found in Karate have lasted for hundreds of years. Once the maximum result is reached, it is hard to improve upon it.  
Focused Power This is the end goal of movements in Karate. Only by expressing the greatest amount of energy can you seek perfection. This concept is demonstrated with broken bricks and boards in Karate displays. This concentrated force demonstrates becoming part of the movement.  
Building Muscular Strength The body is your most powerful tool when practicing Karate. This is why building strong yet flexible muscles are crucial in the art. Certain martial arts will put a focus on skill over physique. Karate believes that a strong person has an equally strong body and mind and it makes no excuses.  
Rhythm & Timing Performing the preset katas is more than a set of memorized movements. To seek the ultimate potential of one of these forms it must flow. The rhythm and timing of these elements work towards this goal. By perfecting the rhythm of the forms, you’ll find the timing when sparring. 

These aspects further connect Karate to its roots. Remember, this is less of a martial skill than it is a gateway to find truth. Only when you have rhythm and timing does this art form become a free expression and less like a memorized dance.  
The Tanden The tanden is the area of your body that includes your lower stomach and hips. This area is given special attention since most of your power comes from this region. Not only that, it also is where your center of gravity is located. 

To be more specific, the tanden is located directly behind your belly button. Scientifically it’s thought of as your center. Spiritually it is viewed as the source of your energy. Since this coincides with so much of Karate’s principles, it’s easy to why special focus is paid to this region. 
What you need As with all martial arts it is recommended that you seek a professional to train you. This will include a fee, but special deals are typically offered to new students. The pricing of this will vary depending on your area and instructor. 

Included in the fee you pay will provide the majority of what you need to learn. A teacher, training facility, and additional equipment are typically located on sight. More advanced students may invest in the creation of personal equipment that they may train with at home. Only with the instructor’s guidance should this be done. 

The clothing or uniform is the standard gi and belt utilized by most martial arts. This can range between $20 and $60. This cost will vary based on size and availability. Some facilities don’t require the gi for beginners. Many times a t-shirt, track shoes, and comfortable running shorts/pants, are all that is required. Your training facility will give proper advice on clothing. 
Learning Conclusion Martial arts are a great way for people to change their lives. Not only does it promote better health, but it instills confidence in the individual. In addition, it gives the person fundamental tools they can use in their every day life. 

The goal of Karate has been described simply as, “You learn to fight, so that you don’t have to fight.” This is an important lesson to teach. Not only is the art teaching the most efficient way to use your body, but it tempers the individual with the need for responsibility. 

Even though many of us are drawn to Karate’s ability to break boards, instructors of the art don’t mind this view point. They know that by guiding a person in Karate these notions will be reformed. In the process, they will mold that individual to become a better person. 

Karate is a very open form. Anyone with a desire to learn is welcome. Age and gender play no role on who can learn the craft. All you need is the desire to apply yourself.",
Cliff Diving,"Cliff Diving Information  Introduction If you’re looking for an extreme hobby, one where you don’t need any real skills, where you don’t need equipment and one that is truly uncomplicated, then Cliff Diving is the hobby for you. You don’t have to buy expensive equipment to practice cliff diving nor do you have to buy special clothing as you would for scuba diving, and one of the coolest factors is you don’t need to hire a provider or someone’s services. You depend on yourself, your guts and your adrenalin! It’s basically just you, your body, the air you’ll be gliding through from extreme heights and then the water. Diving right into the water, into the unknown, is one of the most exhilarating experiences some people experience. Usually the height is around 85-90 feet, that’s just over 26 meters! That’s what extreme hobbyists aim for! 

You won’t be competing so don’t worry about achieving that height right off. Competition cliff diving comes from the Olympics, it’s a mutated form of high diving, with a little bit more insanity sprinkled into the mix. Cliff diving itself however goes back years, to 1770, when the last king of Maui took a scary leap off a 20 meter cliff. It’s ironic that he was that last king of Maui, but the interesting part to this story was that he made his way into the water from that height without a single splash, not a drop. His soldiers and fighters would dive off it later to prove their courage; similar to what you’ll be doing too! 

Cliff diving became an actual recognized Olympic sport in the summer of 1996 when the World High Diving Federation (WHDF) was created. Now, years later, cliff divers, hobbyists just like yourself, travel the globe in search of that perfect dive, the most awesome spot, the adrenaline high of all cliff dives. Most of the cliff dive locations you’ll visit are exotic, beautiful and simply breathtaking from natural flowing pools in Switzerland to the hot tropics of Jamaica and more. Don’t let your mind drift, you’re not cliff diving for the beautiful locations; remember, you’re doing it for the gravity defying free plunging dive through nothing but thin air and extreme speeds into a body of water you can’t see past the surface of. Is your heart racing yet? It better be. 
Cliff Diving Explained When you take that leap into thin air off the side of a cliff, you go into what’s better known as ‘free fall’. This is where gravity becomes the only physical force around your body, the only thing accelerating you with absolutely no resistance. It’s not like running down a steep hill or even snowboarding down the Alps. No, with cliff diving, and your body going into free fall, there’s no friction, period. There’s even little to almost no air resistance if you dive it just right. Remember, gravity is one of the most powerful forces on earth; after all, it keeps everything and everyone from floating into outer space. 

So when you dive, this gravity pulls you closer to earth with no obstacles in its path to slow it down. If you want numbers to crunch, then you’ll be falling at almost 10 meters a second, just over 32 feet. If you want a breakdown of what that means, realize that since time becomes a factor in the free fall, it means the longer you keep falling, the faster you’ll be going. What happens is known as acceleration and every single second you’re falling, there’s an increase in velocity for the next second, and so forth. Think snowball effect but in terms of speed, that’s basically how it plays out. 
Popular Cliff Diving Spots The birthplace of this crazy sport and hobby, cliff diving, is believed to be Hawaii where the king plunged off the cliff and got his soldiers to practice the same thing. For forty years in fact, that very same spot is host to a show, re-acting the jump in a show stopping entertainment expo. But that location where the king used to dive from is not the only location, there are several other amazing and note worthy cliffs in Hawaii that attract cliff diving hobbyists to the scene who all want to have a go at it and test their courage as well as get the adrenaline flowing. 

Mexico is also a hot spot for cliff divers of all ages, young and old. It’s mainly due to a legend, a story that took place there in 1934 when a young boy of 13 years plunged off the La Quebrada in Mexico. The cliff attracts thousands of tourists, pros and hobbyists each month now. There’s even a show that takes place every single day when the sun is setting, where they all line up and hurl themselves off the cliff in synchronization and with the acrobatic excellence of some of the world’s greatest divers. It’s a show unlike any other as the timing, as well as the skill involved are monumental. They jump every day, and have for years without a single serious injury, and only minor ones not even worth noting. They time the jump just right every single time, hit the waves with precision accuracy and do it all like it’s a walk in the park. Watching them dive will have anyone hold their breath. 

Another amazing location with breathtaking scenery is Croatia. In Dubrovnik, there’s a sea known as the Adriatic Sea, where twice a year there are major Competitions held where cliff divers of all skill levels take to the cliffs and do their thing. 

Some divers end up competing at insane heights of a little over 28meters which are among the highest anywhere. The beautiful surroundings and location make for breathtaking dives, but don’t be fooled, the air there is something special. As you get higher in altitude, the air becomes a little thinner, so you get to pick up amazing speeds on the way down and that along with the nice high waves that help break the dive into a painless one add to the excitement of it all. 

The next location is known for its amazing pearly white sandy beaches, equally amazing sunsets and laid back nature, not so much for its real treasure. All the adrenalin junkies know about it, if cliff diving is your hobby, then seeking out that ultimate thrill is your job, and it has just become easier. The 10-20 meter limestone cliffs in the west end cliff range in Negril, Jamaica are where you want to be. Natural pools and the most abnormally calm clear water you have ever laid your eyes on, it truly is a one of a kind locations. There are plenty of hotels and restaurants which do their part by providing their own regulated diving platforms so you can train before taking to higher cliffs. 

One of the last of the main hot spots is without a doubt, Switzerland. Home to the WHDF in Avegno, the amazing cliffs located in and around the Brontallo area are buzzing with activity every year around June-July. Although this is limited to the professionals around that time and if you’re looking to watch you’d have to get one of the limited slots for watchers, it’s amazing. Acrobatic diving like you have never seen. The great thing is after the competitions are over, you can take to the same cliffs yourself to take the plunge yourself. Some other locations include spots where competitions are held that you as a hobbyist could even enter. 
Safe Diving is Key It doesn’t matter whether you’re diving from a 5 meter cliff, or a 28meter one, no jump is a safe jump, no matter how little the distance is. Without a single doubt, and very few will argue this, cliff diving is among the single most dangerous extreme sports on earth. If you thought that was a little much, some tourist locations based in and around the hottest cliff diving zones don’t even mention it when advertising, they know it’s too dangerous to promote. 

Some of the highest cliffs that professionals dive off reach amazing speeds. A diver can reach speeds of up to 190kph on a 24meter dive and 40kph on a small dive of just 6 meters. Think about it for a second, you’re traveling faster than a 911 turbo’s top speed, in the air, pretty much naked...no air bags. It’s dangerous, simple as that. If you hit the water wrong, wrong being if you hit it horizontally or back/stomach first it’s considered as hard as landing on solid concrete from that height. You have to make the jump and hit the water with your feet straight, toes even, or fingers with your body straight vertical line. A small 6meter dive if made wrong can easily compress your spine and break bones.  
Points on pool depths in connection with safety: Now obviously seeing as how there is such danger around diving from extreme heights the WHDF has recommended to the general public that no one dive from 20 meters and upwards. Unless of course there is a professional team of rescuers at hand and located around the diving spot. It’s not a law, but a recommendation that is voiced loudly so that anyone planning to go to a well-known diving location is made aware. 

Among the injuries that are caused by cliff diving: 

• Bruising • Fractures • Broken bones • Compressed spinal chords • Dislocated or broken discs • Paralysation and even death 

Many professional divers around the world who compete in major events end up diving from heights as intense as 26 meters. In one location on earth, Acapulco, the Quebrada divers make it from a little over 46meters. The only reason they live to dive again and again is because these divers are trained from childhood. Some train their entire life before making that dive. They not only master the art of cliff diving, but memorize by heart the cliff diving location, learn the wave habits, times and more, so they become one with the cliff and dive itself. But, having said that, they too get hurt from time to time though no fatalities from this group of divers has ever been recorded in the last 30 years and over 10,000 dives each later. 
Diving Tips for the Eager Hobbyist If you just can’t help yourself or contain your excitement, and truly want to take cliff diving on as a serious hobby, then you need to consider some of the following tips to help you master the art and manage to paddle away from a successful dive safely: 

• Baby steps, there’s no shame in taking it slow and working your way up the ladder, or cliff in this case. Before you even head to a diving spot and pick out your first cliff, try some dives from diving platforms at deep swimming pools. Try to perfect your dive, landing, entrance into the water, pencil dive and more. Just be sure someone is around when you start off to be on the safe side. Try the pencil dive first with your arms pointed down and arms close to your sides plunging feet first, back straight. The aim of this dive is to make the point of entrance/impact as small as possible to reduce the force at which you hit the water. • Again and this cannot be stressed enough, never ever dive on your own. Always have someone with you; no matter how great a diver you become, it’s important to have someone with you. Be it a fellow diver or a watcher, someone who’s close the impact location but far enough not to obstruct your dive. • Before you take that first leap, or any leap for that matter, swim around the area you’ll be lading in. Make sure it’s deep enough and that there aren’t any rocks or hidden obstacles that could injure you or prove fatal. • Another important note to keep in mind is how you’re going to get out the water. Many times novice divers take the jump into the ocean with waves high that break their dive and help them in a softer landing, but forget to check where these waves are headed. Whether or not they’re drifting and crashing into rocks/cliff side or worse. So make sure you know how you’ll be getting out the water, picture the dive then swim out how you intend to on the actual dive. • The wind plays a big role. If it’s really windy, be careful. Wind strikes you at an angle, and if that angle pushes you towards the cliff, then you’re in trouble, so check and double check on that. Gusts of sudden wind might skew your dive projection into a cliff side if it’s high, inches and less matter here due to the speed you’re falling at so always keep that in mind. Jump from a safe location that won’t prove fatal and dangerous if a little wind does come up. • Consider dressing right. A wetsuit is great for higher dives, or any dive in fact. What the wetsuit does is gives divers an extra layer of cushioning that reduces the force of impact on the body a little. DO NOT WEAR WATER SHOES. What that will do is increase the impact area that hits the water, you want to reduce that as much as possible, so bare feet, toes pointed down every time for a safer, less painful dive. 

That’s about it, if you dive safe, you’ll be fine but remember, as with any hobby or sport, or anything in fact, nothing is 100% safe. Find that perfect location, challenge yourself and take to the cliffs, remember to always take someone with you and most importantly, be safe and enjoy yourself!",
Fishing,"Fishing Information  Introduction: Fishing is the activity which involves catching of a fish. Fishing has been in practice for a long time now. Fishing is done using various techniques which includes hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fish are normally caught in the wild. 

Fishing is one of the main sources of food especially for fishing villages. Fishing is also a very useful source of employment and provides work to many. Fisheries and aquaculture provide direct and indirect employment to over 500 million people. In addition to providing food, modern fishing is also a recreational pastime. Moreover, fishing is also thought of as cultural as well as community identity. 

Even in religion, fishing has a powerful influence. All major religions have had the effect of fishing. These include Buddism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism and Jainism. It is believed by Roman Catholics that the first Pope was actually a fisherman. 
Fishing Equipment If you are planning to go out for Fishing, you should equip yourself with following basic fishing equipment. 

Fishing Rod: Without a fishing rod, fishing gear is incomplete. Fishing Rod is a kind of rod which is flexible and long and the length of fishing line is attached to this rod. A fishing rod is used with sinker, hook and line and is used for catching fish. At one end of the rod is bait attached. 

Fishing rod is somewhat similar to fishing pole. A fishing pole is a simple stick or pole. The tip is attached with a line and to the other end a hooked bait or lure is suspended. 

Modern fishing rods have a reel for line stowage and line guides. Commonly the modern fishing rods are made up of carbon fibre, fibre glass or bamboo. There are many different types of fishing rods which vary in size and length as well as the way they are used. Some of the different types of fishing rods are given below: 

• Fly Rods: The rods are available in variety of sizes and length as well. The sizes are designed keeping in the mind the type of fish you will catch with it as well as the weather conditions; both wind and water. They are thin and flexible. Usually, you will find a hook attached with a light weight material. 

• Light Fishing Rods: These rods are designed keeping in mind the small fish. Hence, the rod is used for baiting small fish. Typically, this rod is used for catching bluegill, panfish, trout and bass. The rod is short in length as well as light in weight. 

• Spin Casting Rods: These rods are designed in order to hold the casting spin reel. 

• Ice fishing Rods: These rods are used for catching fish through holes in a frozen lake, ponds or rivers. Hence, the rod is short spanning and has a length which varies between 24 inches and 36 inches. 

Fishing Reel: It is used for deploying as well as retrieving fishing line with the help of a spool attached on an axle. Fishing reels are used together with fishing rod. Thus, fishing reel is another important basic fishing gear. Variety of fishing reels is available in the market. 

Lines: It is a cord designed for fishing. Fishing done using lines and hooks is called angling. Nowadays, lines are made from artificial substances such as dyneema, polyethylene and nylon. 

Hooks: It is used for catching the fish by either ‘hooking’ into the mouth of the fish or the fish body. Typically, a hook is attached to a lure device or a line. There are different types of fish hooks available which varies in size, design, material and shapes. 

Sinkers/Weights: They are used for forcing the bait to sink more quickly or to increase the casting distance. A plain sinker is typically made up of lead. Sinkers can of any shape. 

Fishing Baits: It is an object attached to one end of fishing reel. As the name suggests, fishing baits are used for attracting fish by casting it into the water. There are a variety of fishing baits available as well. Fishing bait can be Natural, such as worms, frogs and bait fish, or Artificial, such as plastic worm. 

Floats: They are bite indicators which floats on the water surface. They indicate to the fisher that something at the end of fishing line, at hook, is happening. Floats are basically visual bite detectors. 

How to ensure that you are buying the right equipment: 

There are variety of rods and reels available in the market from which you can choose. The first thing you need to do is to do a little bit of research on your own. Make yourself familiar with the variety available and which rod or reel is used for what purpose. Remember, different rods and reels are designed to catch different types of fish. Hence, you should also find out the different types of fish (especially in the water where you will be fishing). You don’t want to end up with a wrong fishing rod which cannot catch the fish in the water where you tend to do fishing. 

After you have found out the fish type and the appropriate rods and reels, keep in mind your budget. Rods and reels are most expensive of the fishing gears- second to fishing boat. You should purchase the one which is well within your budget. Also, make sure you know the amount of weight which they can withstand easily. You don’t want to try and handle a bigger fish which the rod is not capable of catching and end up hurting yourself in the process. 

How to research: 

It is simple. There are number of ways which you can adopt. The common ways of doing it are: 

• CDs/DVDs 

• Books 

• Internet/Websites 

Internet is considered to be the best as well as convenient way of researching. You will find all the related information in one place which can be accessed with a single click. Thus, you can easily do your homework and be able to find the right gear. 

Where to buy: You can buy the fishing equipment either from a local shop or over the internet. You will find a number of local shops or online shops which are selling them. Nowadays, most people prefer purchasing via internet. Internet is not only a convenient way of making a purchase but everything is in one place. You can easily shop around without actually having to step out of your home. With a single click you can get the price as well as description of a particular gear. Also, you can easily make a comparison of various price offers. You may even receive a discount if you purchase online. Moreover, your local shop may only be equipped with basic equipment and not the modern gear or doesn’t have the variety. But again you will only find this out if you shop around. From where you purchase depends on how you feel comfortable. It might be possible that you only feel satisfied with the quality if you see it ‘live’ before purchasing. 
Fishing Techniques There are many fishing techniques some of which are Hand fishing, Spearfishing, Netting, Angling, and Trapping. 
How To Do Fishing - Beginner The First thing you need to do is to choose the right location. Choose a point where fish is present. For this you can take look at local fishing reports in newspaper or ask around from marinas or fishing shops. Alternatively, you can also determine by throwing in baits at different points and wait to see. 

Next is the equipment. Make sure you have the basic equipment. You should also have an idea about the fish you will be catching and buy hook and bait accordingly. 

Once you are equipped with the fishing gear and determined the location, you should choose the method of fishing according to the water. Are you fishing in swift water, can be a small river or lake, or is the water movement not rapid? These are some of the questions you need to ask. 

Now, you are ready to cast. Cast the line and wait for the fish to bite. Feed around the bait to attract fish much quicker. Be patient as catching a fish takes a lot of time. Wait for about 15 minutes and if still you haven’t caught a fish then start thinking of casting on someplace else. 

As soon as the fish bite, you will notice a tug on the line. This is the time you should set the hook. For this all you need to do is to jerk backwards and up your fishing rod. If there is a fish, it will definitely struggle to get itself free resulting in line following the fish’s movements. 

Now pull the fish by lifting and pumping your fishing rod in vertical direction. At the same time do reeling as well. Make sure that you are not using the reel for pulling the fish. 

In order to take hold of the fish, use a net. If you plan on letting the fish go then you should keep in water but if you plan on eating the fish then you should take it out from the water as soon as possible. 

Next task is to remove the hook. You should not tear it out. Instead, especially if you will be releasing the fish, back it out very gently. There are also hook removal tools which you may want to purchase and use it. 

You must have already decided, before going out for fishing, whether you will be releasing the fish or eating it. If you are to cook it, then this is the time you should clean the fish. 

There are you are done!! Go for another round of fish catching but make sure to check the line for any damages as well as put bait on the hook once again. 

With a lot of practice and catching, you will be an expert in no time. 
Fishing Tips: Here are some beginners fishing tips which you may find a lot helpful: 

• Before you go out for fishing, make sure you locate the areas in advance where fish is present. You don’t want to sit in water for hours only to find out there is no fish. • The type of bait you use depends on the type of fish. Make sure you do some research in advance or alternatively you can experiment with different fishing bait, while out fishing, to find the right choice. Also, make sure you understand the behaviour of the fishes. • The best time to go out for fishing is early morning or mid-evening. • When you start fishing, initially throw in bait or feed approximately ten maggots or worms. You would want the fish to familiarize themselves with the bait. • Even if the fish is not eating keep throwing but in small amount to get the fish’s attention. • Attach the bait to the hook and as soon as it is pulled by the fish trying to eat it, strike. • When you catch a fish, you should never tear out the hook instead use a hook remover. • If you are fishing in the morning, it is advisable to use a plastic worm which is lighter in colour. • Never overfill the spinning reel when you are refilling. • When casting, try your level best that the lure lands without making much of a noise. Also, you should cast ahead of the target. • You should use wrist while casting instead of shoulders and arms. • Take clothing with you which is waterproof • When you store the reels and rods, it should be in a dry, cool place. Also, make sure that you don’t place the rods against the walls as they will get wrap. • Check for any rules and regulation for the area where you will be fishing. Is a license required?

With a little practice anyone can become master at fishing and will be doing some serious catching in no time.",
Knitting,"Knitting Information  Introduction Knitting is a truly unique and old fashioned hobby that is easy to learn and yet it can take years of practice and study to master all of the techniques. This hobby allows for you to be able to create just about anything out of a few knitting needles and plenty of yarn to do the job. The best thing about getting started is that you will not have to spend much money at all and it is something that all ages can learn. 

The word is derived from knot, thought to originate from the Dutch verb knutten, which is similar to the Old English cnyttan, to knot. 

Knitting developed as a way to create stretchable garments. Knitted garments have the ability to stretch as much as 500% which means that they are great for things like socks and hosiery. 
What you Need In order to knit you really only need two things, a set of knitting needles and yarn. This will cost no more than $20 depending on how much yarn you decide to buy. What to buy can also depend on what you want to make. Some skeins of yarn will offer knitting patterns right on the packaging but it is highly recommended that you buy a beginner knitting book. This will help you learn and visualize the different steps and techniques that will get you knitting like a pro in no time. 

The yarn used can be just about any type you can buy but for a beginning knitter it is a good idea to buy a strong yarn that is not fuzzy or thin. The ideal yarn will be resilient and therefore not very elastic under tension and it will also be easy to see. The fuzzy yarns usually have a very thin strand with lots of fluffy and soft strings attached. These can be very hard to see when knitted and they can also be very stretchy which makes it hard to do tight stitches. It is very possible to use this type of string and they make great projects but it is best to start off with a yarn that allows you to see your stitches and is easy to work with.  
The Stitches When you first learn how to knit, the easiest thing that people start with is a scarf or a small blanket. These items use simple and repetitive stitches that are easy to learn. They can also be made with only one color so you do not have to worry about changing and adding new types of strings. But before you can learn the different stitches there are a few basics you need to know about the knitting process and stitches themselves. 
Types of Beginner Knitting Projects The average project for the typical beginning knitter are scarves. The reason for this is that they are short which means that they do not require long knitting needles and they are easy to start and end. They are also very useful during those winter months and it allows to create something very personal and that you can easily show off. 

Knitted scarves can be as warm or light as you would like them to be. It all depends on how tight you do the stitches and the type of yarn that you use. If you use a thick wool yarn that is very taunt and you do very tight stitches, you will have a thick warm scarf. But if you choose to use a stetchy thin yarn (such as the fuzzy and furry types) and use loose stitches you can have a very lightweight and unique looking scarf. 

Other good beginner projects are blankets, the reason for this is that a beginner can make a blanket simply by making rows of knitted stitches (much like a scarf) and then later attaching them together. This is also a great way to make something that uses multiple colors without having to worry about dropping and picking up colors. Though if you choose to learn how to drop and pick up colors that is another easy way to create a striped blanket. 

Once you get the basics down then you can start learning other stitches and move on to making clothes, purses and even things like warm hats. While you may find it much harder to find knitting patterns than to find crocheting patterns, knitting is a great stepping stone to learning how to crochet. Learning to crochet involves many more stitches and can involve a much bigger learning curve. 
Advanced Knitting Once you have completely learned all of the basics you can then move on to truly unique styles of knitting such as cable knitting and lace knitting. These types of knitting create unique and elegant creations that will be certain to impress just about anyone. 

Cable knitting allows you to create raised “cable” designs in your knitting pattern. This is a technique that is often used to create Celtic knots and other designs in sweaters and blankets. This is a very tricky technique to completely master but it is well worth the effort because your knitting projects will become truly impressive. 

Lace knitting creates a design that looks just like it sounds. It creates beautiful patterns that have the looks and design of lace. This is a knitting style that is normally done with a thin yarn and is often used to make beautiful and elegant doilies and table covers. 

Knitting can be a great way to relieve stress and a fun way to relax. It is also a hobby that can be cheap and easy to start and if you become truly interested in knitting you may even be able to sell your creations.",
Swing,"Swing Information  Introduction to Swing Do you love fun, upbeat music? Do you enjoy learning new dance steps and styles? Learn to swing and you will never find yourself standing alone at the edge of a crowded dance floor again. Instead, you`ll be the life of the party. Let your unique personality shine as you add your flair to the basic swing moves. 
History of Swing Swing music and swing dancing entered the stage during a particularly tough period of time in US history. Shortly after the end of World War I, prohibition laws were put into effect and musicians lost a large portion of their audiences. Soon after, the stock market crashed and the United States entered the Great Depression. Finally, right as things were looking up, World War II began and everyone`s brother, father, and husband got shipped off to battle Germany. 

Fortunately, jazz musicians are famous for using their music to help people persevere through even the toughest of times. After World War I, Jazz shifted into The Swing Era, a period that would last twenty five years. Swing dancing developed in the jazz halls of the 1920s as dancers, frustrated with dance moves that couldn`t keep up with the rhythm of the music, developed a completely new style of dance. 

By the mid-Thirties, dance halls all over the country were dancing the Lindy Hop and the less complex Jitterbug. Dance instructors claimed that the wild and crazy dances were just a fad and would disappear as quickly as they came. However, the swing style stuck and dance schools everywhere began to teach swing to their eager students. 

Swing dance served as entertainment and stress relief during the worst economic period in American history. Throughout the Great Depression, swing continued to spread throughout the country. This affordable form of entertainment kept people social, active, and distracted from the reality of the depression. 

Every region of the United States tweaked the dances to suit their music and their culture. As a result, East Coast Swing and West Coast Swing were developed. In a similar fashion, the Charleston is quite unlike DC Swing. By the 1940s, swing was nationwide and spreading. Soldiers in World War II even carried the style to Europe, where alternative forms of swing then developed. Those styles returned to the United States after the war and changed form again. 

As the United States moved out of its 25+ year long period of trouble, swing didn`t lose any of its popularity. The steps were so versatile they could be applied to virtually any style of music. As music changed, so did swing. Country music and rock`n`roll were added to the swing repertoire. By the 1990s, teenagers and retirees were dancing together in swing clubs and competing in national swing competitions. 

Today, swing dancing takes place to almost any form of music. The steps are adaptable to many different rhythms and styles of music. Swing was developed by people who faced the Great Depression with both determination and a positive outlook. With its upbeat and enthusiastic tempo, swing mimics the positive attitude of those who created the style. 
Swing Music: Past & Present Swing music developed in a period of jazz history commonly known as The Swing Era. This development in swing took place from the late 1920s through 1945. During this time, many great jazz musicians had the opportunity to explore a new realm of jazz. As a result, dancers had an excellent variety of new swing music to which they could dance their new steps. 

The Great Depression was largely responsible for this shift in jazz style. While many of the original jazz musicians dropped out of the music scene when the money disappeared, many talented and innovative young musicians entered the field as their real jobs disappeared. At the moment when Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Benny Goodman finished laying the foundation for this period of jazz development, the influx of talent allowed jazz to become swing. 
Types of Swing Dances Across the country, there are many forms of swing. Not only are there different steps, the styles mimic the culture of the region in which they developed. Each regional swing dance takes advantage of the upbeat nature of swing music, rock`n`roll, and other music styles. Regardless of location, the quick pace and controlled movements remain the core of swing dancing. 

There are two very distinct periods of swing dance development. The first period took place between the 1920s and 1940s. The second period began at the end of World War II and continued well into the 60s. Today, the swing dances of the 1920s through the 1960s are all actively used by swing dancers. Some swing advocates prefer the classics while others prefer the more modern rock`n`roll and jive forms of swing. The following list details the various forms of swing and their primary characteristics.  
Early forms from the 1930s and 1940s • Lindy Hop evolved in the late 1920s and early 1930s out of Partnered Charleston. It is characterized by an 8-count circular basic or ""swing out"" and has an emphasis on improvisation and the ability to easily adapt to include other steps in 8-count and 6-count rhythms. 

• Balboa is an 8-count dance that emphasizes a strong partner connection and quick footwork. A product of Southern California`s crowded ballrooms, Balboa (or ""Bal"") is primarily danced in close embrace. 

• Collegiate Shag typically refers to a kind of double shag that is believed to have originated in New York during the 1930s. To call the dance ""collegiate shag"" would not have been common during the swing era; the addition of the word ""collegiate"" was supposedly a marketing ploy to attract college-age dancers to certain studios and dance halls. • St. Louis Shag done in the ""Sang That Rhyme"" Charleston position. The steps are: two step, rock step, kick forward, step down, kick forward (other leg), stag, step, stomp (repeat). 

• Jitterbug is often associated with one form of swing dance, but is not in fact a general term for all swing dances and is more appropriately used to describe a swing dancer rather than a specific swing dance (i.e. a jitterbug can dance Lindy Hop, Shag, or another swing dance). Once everyone`s soldiers returned from World War II, the second period of swing began with great enthusiasm. Young soldiers wanted to go out to socialize with their friends and meet women. Dance halls provided young people with an excellent place to meet and socialize.  
Later forms from the 1940s, 1950s and later • Lindy Hop continued into the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and is featured in many movies of the era featuring Whitey`s Lindy Hoppers with Frankie Manning, Dean Collins (whose style would lead to the creation of West Coast Swing), and Hal Takier and the Ray Rand Dancers. 

• Lindy Charleston is essentially 1930s and `40s partner Charleston woven in and out of Lindy Hop moves. Lindy Charleston involves a number of positions, including side-by-side, hand-to-hand, and tandem Charleston. • Eastern Swing is an evolution of Fox Trot. 

• East Coast Swing is a simpler 6-count variation of Lindy Hop that evolved with swing band music of the 1940s and the work of the Arthur Murray dance studios in the 1940s. It is also known as 6-count Swing, Triple-Step Swing, or Single-Time Swing. • West Coast Swing was developed in the 1950s as a stylistic variation on Lindy Hop. It is a slotted dance which is danced to a wide variety of music including: blues, rock and roll, country western, smooth and cool jazz. 

• Western Swing, also called Country Swing or Country/Western Swing (C/W Swing) is a form with a distinct culture. It resembles East Coast Swing, but adds variations from other country dances. It is danced to country and western music. 

• Boogie-woogie developed originally in the 1940s with the rise of boogie woogie music. It is popular today in Europe, and was considered by some to be the European counterpart to East Coast Swing, a Six count dance standardized for the American ballroom industry. • Carolina Shag was danced along the strands between Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina, during the 1940s. 

• Imperial Swing is a cross between East Coast and West coast as it is done in slot and in the round. It started at the Club Imperial in St Louis. George Edick, who owned the club, let teenagers dance on the lower level and the swing dancers of the time taught them what was learned from their trips to the east coast. • Jive is a dance of International Style Ballroom dancing. It initially was based on Eastern swing brought to England by Americans Troops in World War II and evolved before becoming the now standardized form of today. 

• Skip Jive A British variant, popular in the 1950s and 1960s danced to trad jazz. 

• Modern Jive - also known as LeRoc and Ceroc - developed in the 1980s, reputedly from a French form of Jive. Modern Jive is not technically of the Jive family which typically use a 6 count pattern of various combinations of walking and triple steps (Ballroom Jive - back/replace triple-triple; Swing Jive - triple-triple back/replace) etc. 

• Rock and Roll - Developing in the 1950s in response to rock and roll music, rock and roll is very popular in Australia and danced socially as well as competitively and in performances. The style has a long association with Lindy Hop in that country, as many of the earliest Lindy hoppers in the early 1990s moved to Lindy Hop from a rock and roll tradition. • Acrobatic Rock`n`Roll Popular in Europe, acrobatic rock and roll is popularly associated with Russian gymnasts who took up the dance, though it is popular throughout Europe today. It is a performance dance and sport rather than a social dance, though there are people who remove the acrobatic stunts to dance it on a social level. 

• Washington Hand Dancing originated in the Washington, DC, Area in the mid-1950s D.C.’s own adaption of the Lindy Hop once the music changed and a new generation of dancers started innovating to Soul Music and R&B. From its very beginning, 

• Push and Whip are Texas forms of swing dance developed in the 1940s and 1950s. They are slotted swing dances, danced to a wide variety of music including blues, pop, jazz, and rock and roll. 
Competition Swing Competition ballroom dancing has existed for several decades. Swing was translated into ballroom friendly forms when it was first introduced to the ballroom dancing arena. However, competition today also includes the unmodified swing style. 

If you are interested in swing competition, your local swing club may have an active competition team. Dance schools and universities also host adult swing competition teams.  
Judging Criteria Each form of Swing Dance and each organization within those forms will have various rules, but those most often used are pulled and adapted from Ballroom follow - Judging for competition is based on the three ""T`s"" as well as showmanship (unless the contest in question designates the audience as the deciding factor). 

The three ""T`s"" consist of: 

1. Timing - Related to tempo & rhythm of the music. 

2. Teamwork - How well a lead and follow dance together and lead/follow dance variations. 

3. Technique - How clean and precise the cooperative dancing is executed.   Showmanship consists of presentation, creativity, costumes, and difficulty. 

It should be noted that Lindy Hops most prestigious events have never used these criteria, usually having the simple judging value of who was the best/most impressive Lindy Hop couple. The Harvest Moon Ball competition in New York City, Th American Vernacular Jazz Institute`s Hellzapoppin` Competition and the Ultimate Lindy Hop Showdown all fall into these category. 

Competition is a fun and challenging way to improve your dance technique and see the latest in swing style. Unlike social swing, you are required to meet team expectations and requirements. When you join a swing team, you may have to purchase a specific uniform and/or special footwear. You will be required to attend all practices and training sessions. If the team travels, you will need to plan accordingly for competition trips. 
Social Swing You don`t have to have a dance partner or a group of friends in order to swing dance. Swing dancing is a social activity. You have the opportunity to meet new people in a fun and exciting environment. For the most part, everyone is more than happy to share their knowledge of swing dancing with each other. You are not required to have expert swing skills to be welcomed into a swing club. 

Many, if not most, of the swing dances listed above are popular as social dances, with vibrant local communities that hold dances with DJs and live bands that play music most appropriate for the preferred dance style. There are frequently active local clubs and associations, classes with independent or studio-/school-affiliated teachers and workshops with visiting or local teachers. Most of these dance styles — as with many other styles — also feature special events such as camps or exchanges. 

Almost every mid to large size city has an active swing community. Check your local newspaper and online event listings for events in your area. If you are unable to locate any events in your city, try the next city over. You might meet people who can send you in the right direction. Don`t be afraid to ask people questions about swing dancing. You never know what you might learn from a fellow dancer. 
Health Benefits That old saying, “Time flies when you`re having fun,” is particularly true when you are swing dancing. You won`t even realize you were on the dance floor for ten songs in a row. After three or four hours of nonstop dancing, you will put in more hours of cardio than most people get in an entire week. 

The health benefits associated with an exercise you enjoy are endless. 

• Increased cardiovascular activity burns fat and calories. • Tones and strengthens your leg, core, and arm muscles. • Increases flexibility and stability. • Promotes healthy weight loss. • Reduces stress and increases energy levels. • Improves posture and coordination. • Strengthens bones in your ankles, knees, and hips. 

Unlike walking on a treadmill or swimming laps, swing dancing combines physical activity with social activity. The exercise is fun and stimulating, thereby reducing the likelihood of boredom or burnout. 
Learn To Swing Dance There are virtually endless resources available for learning how to swing dance. You can begin with online and DVD resources if you would like to get the hang of the individual steps. Once you are comfortable with the moves and the music, try a swing club or a dance class. You will meet others who share your interest in swing and are at a similar skill level. 

• Online lessons: Free lessons are available online. They explain the steps for each in individual movements. Some online lessons even include videos and pictures. There are lots of free online video lessons available.

• Dance classes: Many dance schools offer adult dance classes. These classes include jazz, swing, and hip-hop. Adult classes are quite affordable and are designed to fit a working person`s schedule. Your local gym may also offer dance classes at different times during the year. 

If all else fails, you can post an wanted ad for a dance instructor in your local listings. When you receive a response, you may also find your connection to your community`s swing scene. 
What To Wear While swing dancing has no set uniform, here are some recommendations for appropriate clothing to wear when swing dancing. 

Shoes: Any shoe that will provide support and stability while you are cavorting around on the dance floor should work well. For women, ballroom dancing shoes are an excellent option. If you would rather not wear heels to dance, you can also wear a Ked-like shoe. For men, dress shoes or other lace up shoes are great options. 

Clothing: Wear clothes that allow you to move freely as you dance. Clothing that is overly tight or restricting will limit your dancing ability. Lightweight, loose clothing is ideal. Unless otherwise specified, formal clothing is not required. Overly casual clothing may not be appropriate at most venues. Regardless of what you wear, your comfort is important. 

Jewelry and Accessories: Until you master the moves, avoid dangling earrings and necklaces as well as sharp rings or other jewelry. If you would like to avoid accidentally injuring your partner, refrain from accessorizing. 
Safety Exercise Properly 

Any athletic activity can result in injuries. Due to the speed and intensity of the moves used in swing dancing, you do run some risk of experiencing an injury. Common dance injuries include: 

• Torn or strained muscles • Joint pain • Stress fractures • Torn or strained tendons and ligaments • Shin splints 

Avoid injuries by stretching and warming up prior to participating in dance activities. Proper nutrition prior to strenuous exercise can also reduce the risk of fatigue related injuries. 

Even if you are enjoying yourself, do not forget to stay hydrated. Your body will respond better to exercise if it is hydrated. Dehydration can cause kidney,liver, and heart problems. 

Event Safety 

If you are not traveling to dance events with a friend, let someone know where you are going and how long you plan to be at the event. Some swing events will have over 200 dancers in attendance. No matter how comfortable you feel at the event, do not accept rides from strangers you meet while attending a dance event alone. Many events are alcohol free. Regardless, do not leave your drink unattended or accept drinks from anyone you do not know. If you feel uncomfortable at any time, don`t be afraid to let someone know.",
Doll Collecting,"Doll Collecting InformationINTRODUCTIONNo one is ever too old for dolls. Children throughout the ages have enjoyed playing with dolls, and many adults retain a fondness for the dolls they played with in childhood. Babies find comfort by snuggling with dolls, and preschoolers see them as friends and companions. Girls often explore the world of hairstyles and fashion through their dolls, while boys fight mock battles with action figures and superhero figures (which savvy manufacturers are careful not to label as “dolls”). Many people, especially adults, have taken up the hobby of collecting dolls.In fact, many dolls are produced for adult collectors to display. These dolls may be modeled to resemble infants and children; they may represent adults or fantasy creatures; they may even be representations of popular entertainers or other famous people. Some of these dolls fall into the category of works of art. Most collectible dolls are produced in small quantities or are one of a kind. They often wear elaborate costumes, are intended for display, and are often very costly.WHY COLLECT DOLLS?People collect dolls for many reasons. Some collect them because of fond childhood memories, others for the artistry that goes into making them, others for historical value, and still others for their resale value. People collect what appeals to them and reflect their desires and values.The fine workmanship and artistry that go into making some dolls can attract a collector. It might be the fine bisque china of the doll’s face, the realistic glassine eyes, the wig, the historical clothing or accessories, or simply the winsome expression on the dolls face. A well-made doll is a work of art, and some collectible dolls are one-of-a-kind.Other collectors are drawn to a particular company name or manufacturer, such as Mattel or American Girl. For many collectors, a particular line of dolls may be appealing, such as a particular fashion doll, or a series of historical dolls representing various cultures or periods in history.Sometimes the origin, ethnicity, or historical significance of the doll are what draws a collector. Traditional Japanese dolls dressed in kimonos, or African dolls swathed in colorful kente cloth, or old-fashioned rag dolls may appeal to people interested in other cultures or particular historical periods.And finally, some collectors look on dolls as an investment. As with any collection, a doll collection can be a hedge against inflation. Many popular dolls, such as Barbie®, have increased in value over the years, and certain editions of a particular doll can sell for sizeable amounts of money. Antique dolls have also become collector`s items. Nineteenth-century bisque dolls made by French manufacturers such as Bru and Jumeau be worth almost $22,000 today. If you are lucky enough to have one of these collectible dolls passed down in your family, you could be well on your way to starting a valuable collection.HISTORY OF DOLLSDolls in the Middle Ages were often made from clay, tin, or glass. Clay figures of horses and knights and figurines from glass and tin have been found. In addition, dolls made from bread representing various saints were eaten on religious feast days. Beginning in the 1400s, fashion dolls were created to display the latest Paris fashions to wealthy customers.In America, one of the oldest dolls is the Kachina, made by the Hopi Indians in Arizona. Kachina dolls were hand carved from cactus root or cottonwood, painted with symbolic colors and designs, and dressed in traditional dresses. These dolls were intended as sacred objects for children to study, and were not used as toys. During religious ceremonies, Kachina dolls were given out by masked priests who dressed as ancestral spirits and offered petitionary prayers for the tribe.Colonial Americans made dolls from whatever materials they had on hand, including corn husks, corn cobs, fruits, nuts, and gourds. Northern Indians and Eskimos fashioned their dolls from whalebone, walrus tusk, and mammoth teeth.HISTORICAL DATING OF DOLLSMost dolls, especially antique dolls not originally intended for collectors, do not have a production date stamped on the body. You can tell how old a doll is by the materials it is made from. Here is a list of some of the materials used historically for doll-making.- Wood Or Cloth. The earliest dolls were handmade, using wood or cloth. They were made by parents or relatives for children, or made for ceremonial purposes. They were not mass-produced for commercial purposes.- Papier Machè Dolls. The first mass-manufactured dolls were made from papier machè. Papier machè is a mixture of paper, paste, and water, and was first used in the 1820s. From 1820 through the 1850s, doll heads were made of papier machè and sold separately from the doll body. The head was attached to a constructed body by gluing or sewing it on. These dolls were produced mainly in Germany, Great Britain, and the United States.- China Dolls. After 1850, China became the preferred material for making dolls. China is a ceramic substance with a porcelain-glazed finished. There were two types of China dolls: Frozen Charlottes, made entirely of China, and China Head Dolls, which were produced in a fashion similar to their papier machè precedessors, with a separate head attached to a constructed body. China dolls came in a range of sizes, from miniatures up to 20 inches. These dolls were produced in France, Germany, and Denmark, from 1830 through the mid-1900s.- Bisque Dolls. In the 1840s, bisque dolls became popular. These were made from bisque, a ceramic mixture with an unglazed porcelain finish, which was first developed in the 1840s. The matte finish of bisque ceramic produced a more lifelike doll. Most bisque dolls came from Germany and France, from manufacturers such as Jumeau, Bru, Steiner, and the Société Française de Fabrication de Bété et Jouets (or S.F.B.J.) in France, and Simon & Halbig, Armand Marsellie, Heubach, and Koppelsdorf in Germany. Bisque dolls were manufactured from 1840 through the 1950s.- Rag Dolls. Dolls were not manufactured in the United States until after the end of the Civil War in 1856. Prior to this, dolls were either handmade or imported from Europe. The only dolls commercially produced in the United States prior to this time were rag dolls.- Composition Dolls. Composition is a material composed of sawdust, wood scraps, and glue, first developed in 1907 and originally used to glue airplane parts. In the 1920s, this material became a popular material for doll manufacture in the United States. Major manufacturers at this time included American Character, Madame Alexander, the Ideal Novelty Toy Company, and the Effanbee Doll Company. Composition dolls were produced from 1907 through 1949.- Latex (Rubber) Dolls; Hard Plastic dolls. In the 1940s and 1950s, Magic Skin Latex (rubber) and hard plastic came into the forefront of doll manufacture. Latex was more flesh-like than previous materials and produced dolls that actually resembled real babies. Hard plastic had the advantage of being unbreakable and could be given finer detail, especially for the doll face, fingers, and toes. These dolls date from the 1940s-1950s.- Vinyl. In the late 1950s, hard plastic was replaced by vinyl. Vinyl is the material of choice for doll making today. Vinyl is unbreakable, more flexible than latex or hard plastic, and can be used to sculpt lifelike features.If a doll is an original antique, its clothing, hair, and accessories will date from the period in which it was made. To determine the date of a doll, you can consult books about dolls, or use identification and price guides that are published for this purpose.HOW DO I GET STARTED? TIPS AND TRICKSAll you really need to become a doll collector is a love of dolls. You can begin collecting at any age. Many girls start collecting with a special doll given to them in childhood. Mothers begin when they purchase a doll for their daughter, and rediscover the pleasure of dolls. Women often start collecting from a desire to recover their youth.Once you decide to become a collector, a good starting point is to inventory the dolls you already have. You may own that vintage Barbie, or a valuable antique China doll handed down from your grandmother.From there, go on to locate sources of information about dolls and doll collecting. Libraries have books and other resources to help you begin your research, and their services are usually free of charge. Doll magazines are a source for the latest information about doll history, artists, prices, and collecting tips. In addition, try to attend doll shows, where you can view dolls on display, meet other collectors, and purchase dolls.One place to begin your search is online. There are many websites devoted to dolls and doll collection, and you can purchase dolls from online vendors or from online auction sites such as eBay.Learn The LingoIn order to make the most of your doll search, you must learn the “lingo” of doll collectors. Here are a few of the acronyms and abbreviations you will find in the descriptions of dolls:A/O - All Original.HTF - Hard to find.MIB - Mint in Box (describes a factory mint-condition doll in the original box).MIP - Mint in Package.MNB - Mint no Box (a doll in pristine condition, no box).NM - Near mint. Excellent condition.NRFB - Never Removed from Box. This is as pristine as it gets, and can increase the doll’s value.While there are many types of dolls from which to choose, most doll collectors will tell you that the most important place to start is to choose dolls you love. The value of a doll is not only its price on the collectors’ market; it is the pleasure it gives to its owner. While collectible dolls sell for a price, all doll lovers can tell you that the best dolls are priceless.Avoid Mistakes Made By New CollectorsSeasoned veterans will tell you there are a few mistakes that new collectors tend to make. You want every doll you see and tend to buy indiscriminately. Slow down, and avoid impulse buying. Also, become part of a collecting community, whether in your local area or online. Attend doll shows and get to know other collectors. Part of the fun of collecting is sharing with other collectors.Find several sources for obtaining dolls. While eBay is convenient, it is not the only source of dolls. Part of the fun of doll collecting is visiting antique shops, yard sales, and auctions, and getting to touch and hold the dolls before you purchase them. In addition, while it’s great to get a bargain, don’t try to buy too cheaply. The most collectible dolls aren’t usually the cheapest, and you want to avoid owning a closet full of “junk” dolls that will never increase in value.When you have surveyed the doll world and found your interests, it’s a good idea to focus your collection. Your collection will be more valuable and more interesting—both to you and to potential buyers—if you focus on a particular type or era of doll. You will learn more and will have a more attractive collection for display.Finally, have fun with your collection. Unless you are collecting vintage antique dolls for their resale value, you don’t need to keep all of your dolls in boxes. Take them out of the box, display them, dress them up, and play with them. You probably played with your dolls as a child; why not play with them now?CONCLUSIONDolls have been around for almost as long as there have been people to treasure them. Prehistoric people made miniature human figures from stone or clay for reasons we can only guess. Ancient Egyptians used dolls to people their tombs in hopes of having servants in the afterlife. American Indians used them for religious ceremonies and teaching. Europeans and Americans used them as toys for children and models for the latest fashions. Today, dolls are popular toys for children and collectible works of memorabilia and art for adults. Anyone who loves dolls can become a collector.

Opera,"Opera Information  Introduction Opera is an western classical art form where singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining words and musical score. There are components of acting, costumes, scenery as well as dance. 
Enjoying opera Although many people may feel that opera is complicated and difficult to understand, with a little preparation most operatic performances are both entertaining and educational. Some operas are performed in English, but it is certainly common for popular operas to be in Italian or German. To enjoy an opera in a foreign language, it is important to familiarize yourself with the story beforehand. You can either read up on the plot ahead of time, or simply allow yourself time before the performance to read through the plot summary in the performance program. When booking tickets, check to see if there are sub or sur titles, and that the seats you choose have a clear view of the translations. 

It is also helpful not to select seats that are very close to the stage. Not only is it often cheaper to sit higher up or further back, but you can get a better view of the stage as a whole from being a little further away. Most operas can take at least two to three hours, so take advantage of the intermissions to get a drink and read up on the next section of the plot. You will soon find you have some favorite opera companies, favorite performers, and even favorite operas that you enjoy seeing over and over again, so that the plot becomes something of an old friend! That is when you have reached the level of the true opera-goer!",
Letterboxing,"Letterboxing Information  Introduction To Letterboxing Welcome to letterboxing! Letterboxes are everywhere. You can find them tucked away in tiny towns and buried deep inside the biggest cities all over the world. Who knows, you might walk right by a letterbox or two every day.

The letterboxing community is very supportive. Newbies all over the world have access to hints, tips, and suggestions from experienced letterboxers. Who knows, maybe a fellow letterboxer will take you under their wing as you get started in your new hobby.= 
What Is Letterboxing? The concept of letterboxing is simple. Consider the letterboxer as a treasure hunter of sorts. Each letterbox is a treasure waiting to be found. You never know where the treasure might be tucked away. Your local health food store, coffee shop, restaurant, or park could hold countless numbers of letterboxes. 

Letterboxing is an outdoor hobby that combines elements of orienteering, art, and puzzle solving. Letterboxers hide small, weatherproof boxes in publiclyplaces and distribute clues to finding the box in catalogs, on one of web sites. Individual letterboxes usually contain a notebook and rubber stamp. Finders make an imprint of the letterbox`s stamp and leave an impression of their personal stamp on the letterbox`s logbook. Proof of having found the box and letting subsequent letterboxers see who have visited. 

Not all letterboxes are outside. With the increasing popularity of letterboxing, many businesses host letterboxes. Other letterboxes are handicap accessible. Indoor and accessible letterboxes open this hobby up to many who would find treasure hunting out of their comfort zones or their abilities. 
History of Letterboxing Letterboxing is gaining popularity at an incredible rate. This global hobby is firmly rooted in England. While the hobby has evolved from its simple origins, modern letterboxing mimics the movement of letters from one box to another. For 150 years, dedicated letterboxes have created, hidden, hunted, and maintained their precious letterboxes. Interest in letterboxing in the U.S. is considered to have started with a article in the Smithsonian Magazine in April 1998. 
Types of Letterboxes Letterboxing is no longer the simple quest for a hidden box full of letters. Modern letterboxes come in all shapes and sizes. Clues vary in difficulty and the rules for each box can vary. When you find a letterbox, follow the rules of the type of letterbox you find. 

There are many different kinds of letterboxes, each with some specific distinction. These include: 

Traditional Boxes 

A normal letterbox, hidden and uses clue to find it. These boxes are the most common type of letterbox. There are approximately 140,000 traditional letterboxes on record. A typical box contains the log book and a stamp. Occasionally, you will find other letterboxes within a traditional letterbox. 

Mystery boxes 

These are usually traditional boxes, but these ""mystery"" boxes have either vague starting areas. Clues come in the form of poems, stories, and codes. Many mystery boxes have two sets of clues. The first set indicates the starting location of the clue. The second clue may or may not be as difficult as the first clue. This clue will indicate the location of the letterbox in relation to the starting point. 

Bonus Box 

The clue for these are usually found in a traditional box as an extra one to find. Usually planted in the same area as the traditional that hosts its clue. Clues can be distributed in any way. 

Hitchhikers Boxes 

A travelling letterbox, it is placed in a traditional letterbox for another boxer to find. When found, it is stamped just like a traditional letterbox, but is then carried with the boxer to the next box. 

Hitchhikers are not to be confused with unidentified stamps in a traditional letterbox. Many letterboxers include an additional stamp to indicate when their box was hidden. This unidentified stamp cannot be logged as a find. 

Fleas 

Like a combination of a hitchhiker and a cootie. You can either put in a traditional letterbox, like a hitchhiker, or put it on a person, like a cootie. Fleas can be avoided in the same way as cooties, don`t provide anyone with an opportunity to tuck one into your bag. 

Virtuals 

Online letterboxes; actually a scavenger hunt of sorts through different websites, collecting answers to questions posted as the clues to the box. Answers sometimes are unscrambled or simply emailed to the creator the final answer is put in a blank in a web address, which takes the finder to the image online. While many refuse to acknowledge these letterboxes, they are an excellent way to entertain children or practice writing clues. If you are unable to get out to find letterboxes, virtual letterboxing can keep you entertained. Virtual letterboxes can be logged on some letterboxing websites but will not show in your PFX count. 

Limited time Boxes 

A letterbox that has only been planted for a short amount of time (Like a few days or a week, any time length the planter wants.). Seasonal clues like Christmas tree ornaments in front yards or holiday specific boxes may remain the same but will only return to their locations during the appropriate time of year. Others celebrate an event and will only remain in their locations until the event is complete. 
Basic Letterboxing Equipment Not only is letterboxing one of the least expensive hobbies to begin, you can get your supplies at any craft store in the country. There are no lessons to take or specialty items to buy. In fact, the list of essential letterboxing gear is quite short: 

Signature Stamp 

You can make your own rubber stamp or buy one from any craft store. As a beginner, you might opt for a store bought stamp so you can begin letterboxing right away. Your signature stamp should express who you are. Some carve their trail name and a symbol, others buy an oak leaf to indicate their passion for nature. Regardless of which type of stamp you choose, make sure you like your stamp. This is your sign and you will see it every time you stamp in to a letterbox. 

Your local craft store might sell the rubber and carving tools for handcarving. You can also find kits online. Get creative. Almost any image can become a rubber stamp. 

Ink 

There are many types of inks available and even more color options. The three ink types most commonly used for letterboxing are alcohol, dye, and pigment. Pigment is the most popular ink as the colors are rich and the ink itself works well for stamping. Dye based inks dry a little more quickly and work well for stamping. Finally, alcohol based inks dry very quickly for speedy letterboxing. However, their stamping quality is poor in comparison to the quality of ink and pigment. 

Small ink pads with raised pads work very well for letterboxing. These tiny ink pads are also easy to keep in a pocket. Larger pads tend to tear, shred, and get ink all over the place. 

Logbook 

You can use any book with a hardcover. Books without lines will show off the stamps you collect. However, lined books will also work well. Look for thick pages that will not bleed through. Save a page or two at the beginning of your book to stamp your signature stamp and any other stamps you make. The rest of the book can be dedicated to the letterboxes you find. 

Pen 

Test your pen before you take it on the trail. Many logbooks will be damp when you find them. The wrong pen could tear the log book, bleed, or not write at all. Space pens are excellent for writing in all conditions. A ballpoint pen or a fine tipped permanent marker also work quite well. 

Other 

You might also consider a shoulder bag or backpack to hold your letterboxing gear. Here are some ideas of other handy items to take along when letterboxing: 

• Bug spray • Sunscreen • A hat • Baby wipes (to remove ink) • A small first aid kit • Water and a snack • A collapsible stool 

As you letterbox more, you will think of items that will make letterboxing more pleasurable for you. Add these items to your gear bag and share your ideas with other letterboxers. 
How To Locate Clues Before you head out to find your first letterbox, find a few clues. There are many places to find the clues you will use to locate letterboxes. 

Online 

AtlasQuest offers the most comprehensive database of letterboxes and letterboxers in North America. You can perform location based searches to find clues to letterboxes in your area. You can also map and print clues directly on the site. The forums are an excellent resource for anyone starting a letterboxing hobby. 

Letterboxing.org provides clues to many boxes. AtlasQuest links to some of these clues. Letterboxing.org has fewer clues and does not allow users to build profiles, track finds with efficiency, or interact with other letterboxers. They do provide a great source for clues. 

Other 

You might receive a clue by word of mouth. You can also find clues in annual letterbox catalogs. However, in North America, these catalogs are few and far between. The online resources available are a more efficient way to find letterbox clues. 
How To Find A Letterbox Once you have your clues in hand and your bag is packed, you are officially ready to find your letterbox. 

Getting There 

Once you pick a clue to follow, you will need to figure out how to get to the starting point. You can do this using online mapping systems like Google Maps or Mapquest. Once you reach your destination, follow your clues with care. 

Following Clues 

Steps and paces will often confuse the letterboxer. In general, you can count the steps or paces with your normal stride. If the clue tells you to look for a specific tree, log, rock, or doorway in the next step, see if you can locate that item from your position. If not, either try again or reassess your clues. 

Letterbox Hiding Places 

Letterboxes are usually tucked away where they can`t be spotted by the casual passerby. Look for piles of leaves or neatly arrange sticks to find your letterbox. Some are located in the trunks of trees. Others are hidden underneath rocks or in holes. If you can`t see the letterbox right away, keep looking. A letterbox is not supposed to be easy to find. 
Plant Your Own Letterbox Planting your own letterbox can be a lot of fun. Follow these steps to make sure your letterbox will be a pleasure for other letterboxers to find. 

1. Research your location. If another letterbox exists near the location you like, either ask the other letterbox`s owner for permission to plant a box nearby or pick another location. 

2. Create your stamp. You can hand carve or buy your stamp. You will find great carving guides online if you choose to make your own. 

3. Create your clue. Walk the path and work these steps into your clue. Your clue should reflect the theme. An explanation at the beginning followed by a simple clue detailing the steps will suffice. More complex clues that fit the steps into the story are enjoyable to write and more interesting for the letterboxer looking for your letterbox. 

4. Make your letterbox. Buy a watertight box and label it inside and out with “This Is Not Trash, It Is A Letterbox” or something similar. You can reference AtlasQuest website in case someone wants more information. In this box you will place your stamp and a logbook. This might be a ring bound set of notecards or a handmade logbook. Seal everything in ziploc bags to protect the stamp and book from water. 

5. Post Your Clues. Post your clue to the online clue databases and watch the finds come pouring in. 

6. Reward First Finders. Include a stamped card or a trinket in the box for the first finder. This is their reward for getting to your box first. 

7. Maintain Your Box. Check your box periodically to make sure the box is intact and the stamp and logbook are in good shape. Replace both as necessary. 
Letterboxing Safety Follow these safety guidelines to make your letterboxing experience the best it can be: 

1. Never go alone. If you do go solo, provide someone with a list of the locations you are visiting. Check in with that person periodically. You never know who is lurking in the woods. 

2. Wear appropriate clothes and footwear. Pay attention to the weather. Shorts and flip flops are generally a bad idea in the woods as you will eventually bleed for letterboxing. Keep warm and dry in rain and cool weather or keep cool in hot weather to prevent hypothermia and heat stroke. 

3. Eat food and stay hydrated. Enough said. 

4. If you plan to meet up with a stranger to letterbox, meet for the first time or two in a very public place. You are not obligated to spend time with anyone who makes you feel uncomfortable.",
Model Airplanes,"Model Airplanes Information  Introduction There is nothing quite like a miniature model of any flying aircraft. Given the size of an actual aircraft, models become the best way to have a collection of this vehicle type. The process involves a kit, some glue, and patience. However, this is only the first step for the hobby. 

The project may begin with a box of plastic elements, but there is no end to the amount of customization that is possible for a professional model builder. Some of the options may include a unique paint job, a conversion to a different vehicle, or a modification to a model, like battle damage. The only limitation is how detailed do you want to get. 

It should be noted that models of aircraft can be divided into two major categories. These are static and flying models. Static models have more detail and are meant for displays. The flying model simulates the physics found in aircraft, but they tend to have little resemblance to real aircraft. 
Tools for static models If you find that you are serious about pursuing modeling, you’re going to need a number of tools to help in the process. These tools are broken up into two major groups. The first is the essential tools of the trade. These tools enable you to get the proper amount of detailing found in professionally built models. 

The second group of tools is more for luxury. These tools make the process easier and the outcome better. These tools are also more expensive so only get them if you find your hobby has turned into a passion. It’s recommended that you start with the basic tools before working your way up to the luxury tools.
Essential Assembling a model by hand is only for the youngest and most basic model builder. These sets most likely have a snap together design with no tools required. Those types of models need little to know guidance and their outcome will show a very basic model. 

When you’re ready for the ones you want to display, you’ll need a few tools to help accomplish this. The following paragraphs will introduce the tool and describe some of the functionality of the tool. 

The first tool is a hobby knife. The knife comes in two parts the blade and the handle. The normal blade type used in model building is a number 11. The average brand for this knife is Exacto knife. The hobby knife is a great tool for removing plastic pieces from the sprues (the plastic frame that holds the pieces. It also is useful in removing the flash (extra plastic that is still attached to your piece) from the pieces. You can also use the knife in a dozen other situations that you might come across in the process of building the model. 

Safety glasses are an important part of model building. When you`re cutting pieces tiny shards and debris are likely to fly about causing minor annoyance and/or injury. Since a good degree of eye sight helps in the model building process, it’s wise not to chance blinding yourself. The safety glasses also play a substantial role in protecting your eyes from harsh glues paints and other materials you might need throughout the build. 

Sand paper can prove to be invaluable when trying to achieve a high degree of detail. It can be used to sand away excess glue or create a much smoother surface when painting. It’s recommended to get a variety of grits for these purposes. 400 to 1000 are perfectly suitable ranges when selecting the fineness of the grit. Some modelers go as fine as 2000 for their models. 

Fine tweezers make an excellent tool in model building. During any detailed model build, you’ll find occasions to handle extremely tiny pieces. These pieces require a fine tool to allow you to grip and place the piece while still being able to see the piece. The fine tweezers are custom designed exactly for this task. 

Paint brushes are a modeler’s best friend. Even when you use airbrushing techniques, you’ll still find that small out of the way parts will need a touch of paint. You can also use these delicate brushes to maintain your models. Perhaps they need a delicate dusting or a small piece needs a touch up to its paint job. Check with your local hobby store to determine if they recommend certain sizes for various jobs. 

Pins prove to be ideal for applying a very fine bead of glue. They not only have the ability for amazing precision, but they also give the modeler great visibility on where the glue will be applied. Since the pins are made of metal, they will resist bending or warping like other options you might think of to accomplish this task. 

Toothpicks may not be ideal for applying glue like pins, but they do have their uses. Mostly they’re best for stirring your small containers of paint. They also are a good for testing the color and consistency of your paint. It also helps that they’re really cheap. 

Glue, without it your models won’t stay together. Check your kit for suggestions on which glues will work best. If no suggestions are given, Testers Glue in the tube will serve for most things. You can also get the advice from the clerk at the hobby store. 

Filler, this usually comes in a tube. The large scale equivalent would probably be cocking. Its use here is to smooth out areas between glued parts. Once applied and set, you can use sand paper to smooth the area and get it prepped for painting. 

If you aren’t sure if a part fits together, tape makes an excellent tool for helping to figure this out. Tape also makes it easy to cover areas you don’t want painted. Use it similarly to how you’d paint around a window. 

Disposable gloves make a nice addition to your modeling tools. Some glue will recommend keeping away from contacting your skin. This will aid in making this possible. Also, gloves will help prevent finger prints when you get to the painting stage of your modeling project. 

Finally, paints and thinners are the final essential tools. This will be where the primary amount of customization of your model comes in. It’s recommended that you select the thinner that the paint used recommends. This will insure the most optimum effectiveness and reduce damage to your model.  
Luxury As you build more and more models, you might find that certain areas of the process must have an easier method. A lot of times they do. However, it’s really only justifiable if you use the tool more than a hand full of times. 

The following tools outlined here are designed to not only make your life easier, but give a more polished model. They may take some time to figure them out. Once you do, it will make a world of difference. 

The first two tools are the cutting pliers and razor saw. Both are designed for very precise cutting of small object. This makes pieces held by the toughest sprues a breeze. They can also come in handy if you need to convert a model and need a piece cut. 

For those who want a more specific tool, you do have the option of a sprue cutter. This tool is specifically designed for modelers to remove parts. The only draw back is that it has a little less functionality that the cutting pliers and razor saw. 

To get more visibility when assembling or painting your model, you can always invest in a desk lamp that has a magnifier. The magnification is not terribly powerful, but it does give you an edge in dealing with very small detail work. 

If you find you get tired of gluing and filling, you can move to a more advanced glue. It’s called Cyano-acrylate glue. Many refer to it as C.A. glue. This will not only glue pieces, but it makes excellent filler all in one. It is a very strong product, so it’s recommended to wear safety glasses with it. 

When attempting to get a better paint job on a model, it’s recommended to use either a spray can or airbrush. For an airbrush you’ll also need a small air compressor. Due to the application process, you will eliminate streaks left behind by brushes. 

Other accessories that can aid in the painting process help the modeler more than the model. Three such pieces of equipment are the paint booth, turntable and hot-glue gun. The paint booth will help ventilate and catch loose paint that shoots from the spray variety paint applicators. It is perfect for those who don’t have the option of building your model outside. 

The turntable allows the modeler from touching painted areas. The turning action also means they don’t have to get up from where they are sitting. 

The hot-glue gun is used slightly differently. By utilizing the glue on a scrap piece of material, you can use it to position small plastic pieces when painting them. Fortunately, this is probably something you already have and won’t be an additional cost. 

Finally, for the most advanced modelers, there’s the dremel motor tool. This is both a cutting and grinding device that makes alterations of plastic pieces possible. It’s recommended that when you begin using this tool, start out with more basic models that are less expensive. This will give you plenty of practice so that when it does matter you’ll have the experience needed for the job. 
Preparations for Static Models Before starting you will want to prepare a few things first. The most important point is deciding where you’re going to build the model. A flat sturdy surface is essential for this task. Many people will choose the dining room table for this very reason. However, the model may take more than one sitting to complete. 

This is why you should look for certain things when selecting a work space. First, is the surface flat and sturdy? Second, is there adequate lighting? Third, is there proper ventilation of the area? Fourth, is it okay if things spill in this area? With these questions answered you can determine the perfect spot for model building. 

Now that you have a work space all picked out, you need to prepare the parts. This includes washing the pieces before assembly. In the model making process, the pieces of your model have to be pulled out of a mold. To do this a mold removal agent is applied to the parts. This agent will prevent other materials from adhering to the surface of the pieces, this includes paint you might try using. 

This is why you should wash your pieces first. Take a pan of soapy water and lightly scrub the parts in the sprues with your finger. You can let the parts air dry on a paper towel or other soft clean surface. If beads of water settle on the parts you should use a blow drier to prevent them from spotting the pieces. 

You can repeat this process before painting your model. The oils in your fingers can have a distorting effect on your paint job. They may leave finger prints and or cause an uneven coat of paint. 

Fix parts that are defective in some way. This includes removing flash from the pieces. You can cut this off with a hobby knife. Fill in sink spots if necessary. Sink spots are typically caused by necessary techniques in the molding process. They show up as depressions in the plastic. Most of the time, these spots are put in out of the way places and don’t need filling. However, if the piece is highly visible you may need to use filler. 

Another fix that some parts need are cosmetic than anything else. For example a part may contain a copyright stamp by the manufacturer. This will be very noticeable if you’re going for an extremely detailed look. You can remove this writing with some rubbing with sand paper. 

Read and make notes on your instructions. Many times the instructions will give you a good idea where the tough spots are in your model. You can make note of them and prepare yourself mentally to handle them. It also is good to make notes if you plan to alter the model’s design in certain areas. The instructions also are likely to provide a list of paints to use for an accurate portrayal of the model. With a list of paints in hand, you can have what you need when you need it. 

As stated before, a model may take more than one sitting. This means you might want to prepare an area for storing pieces. For decals and small pieces that have been painted, you should use zip-loc bags or similar type container for storage. For pieces still in the sprues you can fit these back in the box. Make sure to separate these pieces with paper towels to prevent scratching of the pieces. 

Now that you have all your tools and the prep work out of the way, you can begin building your favorite models. 
Conclusion As with any small scaled version, you first must ask yourself whether you want the detailed look or the functionality. This question will determine which form of model aircraft you peruse. 

People of all ages have been fascinated with the world of aviation. No matter how you approach model aircraft building, it makes the perfect way for anyone to explore this vast world of flight. The skies are the limit.",
Autoracing,"Introduction to AutoracingIf speed is your medicine, then auto racing is the perfect hobby for you. Many think of auto racing as just getting behind the wheel of a fast car and going around laps, racing your opponents until that chequered flag is waved and someone ends up winning. In essence, that would be correct, but it’s far from accurate. Auto racing isn’t the world’s most watched sport because it’s fun or because it’s fast. It’s one of the world’s most watched high profile forms of sports entertainment because there’s just nothing else in the world that can compete with it.Many people assume that auto racing somehow has to do with ‘street racing’ as that consists of automobiles racing, but little do they know that street racing is not only dangerous, but also usually illegal in every country in the world.Auto Racing is a prestigious racing sport; it’s one where safety comes first, both for the drivers and the spectators. It’s a sport of reflexes, eye coordination, stamina, skill and also intelligence. It’s a strategic sport more than anything else because at the end of the day, in most auto racing categories, all the cars in a particular race are usually of the same class. So they’re of the same weight, go as fast as all the other cars and usually have nothing special more than their color.Taking auto racing up as a hobby is not for the faint of heart though, and there’s the cost factor to take into account. To take up auto racing, you need to decide what sector you’re going to race in and this usually means a particular type of car to race in. Most races require the driver to be sponsored so you also need to look into that, which usually just means paying a sponsor to sponsor you if you’re just starting out, or impressing them by winning other lower scale events with rented vehicles or as a fill in driver.To buy some of the cars for some of the more high end sectors in the auto industry could mean paying anywhere from $50,000 to $250,000 or more! Some of the more affordable racing categories just ask you to pay entry fee and you get to use their cars, so that’s always an option too. Auto Racing Classified With Auto racing evolving as much as it did, it was inevitable that different branches of the industry would go their own route and different racing categories would emerge. Different race track terrains, different cars, different rules and regulations, different speeds, etc. that all generally led to one thing: amazing races.Some of the more popular categories in auto racing include F1 also Formula One, which is a yearly championship held that hosts drivers from all over the world driving some of the popular auto brands as well as a few private cars.Touring car racing is also popular but is considered a totally different style of racing. It consists of production cars tuned up to be super cars that are raced on the track. BMW, Audi and other brands are among the leading manufacturers that generally dominate this sport. It’s mainly watched n the US and that’s where most of the races are held all year round.Now Sports car racing, unlike F1 is something all hobbyists can enjoy, at a cost of course. These races are similar to F1 and touring cars with the brand automobiles turned into low driving speed demons that truly go where no car has gone before. They’re among the more dangerous types of cars to drive as they have a tendency to life off the ground because of their shape, light weight and the speed they travel at, but that’s not to say any other form of auto racing is safer. These cars have closed cockpits and the wheels don’t protrude like in formula one. They go much faster and were generally built for long races in the Le Mans series which are 24 hour long races. These races consist of multiple drivers for the same car, switching seats every few hours and completing the race. The great thing about Sports car racing is that hobbyists can join in the fun by sponsoring a car, this usually means paying up to around $35,000 to get a leg of a race but it’s an experience worth trying.In drag racing, the objective is to complete a given straight-line distance, from a standing start, ahead of a vehicle in a parallel lane. This distance is traditionally ¼ mile (400 m), though ⅛ mile (200 m) has become popular since the 1990s. The vehicles may or may not be given the signal to start at the same time, depending on the class of racing. Vehicles range from the everyday car to the purpose-built dragster. Speeds and elapsed time differ from class to class. Average street cars cover the ¼ mile in 12 to 16 seconds, whereas a top fuel dragster takes 4.5 seconds or less, reaching speeds of up to 530 km/h (329 mph). Drag racing was organized as a sport by Wally Parks in the early 1950s through the NHRA (National Hot Rod Association). The NHRA was formed to discourage street racing.When launching, a top fuel dragster will accelerate at 3.4 g (33 m/s²), and when braking parachutes are deployed the deceleration is 4 g (39 m/s²), more than the Space Shuttle experiences. A top fuel car can be heard over 8 miles (13 km) away and can generate a reading from 1.5 to 3.9 on the Richter scale.Drag racing is two cars head-to-head, the winner proceeding to the next round. Professional classes are all first to the finish line wins. Sportsman racing is handicapped (slower car getting a head start) using an index (a lowest e.t. allowed), and cars running under (quicker than) their index ""break out"" and lose. The slowest cars, bracket racers, are also handicapped, but rather than an index, they use a ""dial-in"". Bracket racing has been viewed as the main cause of the loss of public interest in drag racing. People do not understand why the slower car wins or why somebody needs to hit the brakes to avoid going too fast. Many local tracks have also complained that bracket racers will also go out of their way to spend as little as possible while at the track by bringing their own food, beverages, fuel, and supplies; thus, making it more difficult for tracks to make money on these events. This causes gate prices to rise and tracks losing interest in having such events.In the USA, and now many parts of the world, another form of auto racing that has become popular is stock car racing. These are light weight closed cars that drive at incredibly high speeds in an over circuit competing with each other. Unlike the other auto racing styles mentioned above, stock car racing is one of the few racing sports where contact is allowed. This means, at unbelievably fast speeds, cars can touch each other. Not to intentionally veer another off course, but to get passed and be done strategically.A less popular form of stock car racing made popular in the early 1990’s was crash derby. This was an event where anyone with a car could enter. You get a number painted on your car, a helmet and you drive into a ring and start your engine. When the lights go green, instead of racing each other, you step on the gas and head straight for each other; crashing into each other in an attempt to render the other driver’s car useless. The last car moving was declared the winner. Of course, your car would have to be modified and approved by the crash derby association, but that’s not to say it won’t still be fun.One-make, or single marque, championships often employ production-based cars from a single manufacturer or even a single model from a manufacturer`s range. There are numerous notable one-make formulae from various countries and regions, some of which – such as the Porsche Supercup and, previously, IROC – have fostered many distinct national championships. Single marque series are often found at club level, to which the production-based cars, limited modifications, and close parity in performance are very well suited. Some of the better-known single-make series are the Radical European Masters, John Cooper Mini Challenge, and Clio Cup, and at a more modest budget, Ginettas, Caterhams, BMWs, and MX5s. There are also single-chassis single seater formulae, such as Formula Ford, Formula Renault, Formula BMW, and Formula Vee, usually as ""feeder"" series for ""senior"" race formulaTarga is a tarmac-based road rally which is run all around the world. This began with the Targa Florio. There are many races including Targa Tasmania held on the Australian island state of Tasmania run annually since 1992. The event takes its name from the Targa Florio, a former motoring event held on the island of Sicily. The competition concept is drawn directly from the best features of the Mille Miglia, the Coupe des Alpes and the Tour de Corse. Other events around the world include the Targa Newfoundland based in Canada, Targa West based in Western Australia, Targa New Zealand and other smaller events.",
Astral Projection,"Astral Projection Information  Introduction Astral projection is one’s ability to leave the physical body. It is an out-of-body experience where the astral body, or consciousness, separates itself from the physical body and travels in the astral planes. This is achieved during a waking, relaxed state, lucid dreaming or during deep meditation. The concept of astral projection has been practiced for thousands of years. It is said to date back to ancient China. Practically everyone can experience astral projection. In fact, every one of us leaves our body at night, after our physical mind sleeps, except that we don’t recall it. After the physical mind sleeps, the subconscious mind takes over. This is when we experience our astral projection. 
Getting Started With Astral Projection Astral projection and astral travel are amazing experiences, and practicing these can enhance our lives in many ways. The experience hones your psychic abilities and helps in your personal development. You can also recall your past lives and much more. Whatever your motivation to learn astral projection, there is plenty of information available. There are several techniques, and there really is no formula for the “best technique.” It is a good idea to join online forums and discussion boards related to astral projection and share your thoughts with practitioners and non-practitioners to get a better insight. There are also plenty of e-books and newsletters you can sign up for to enhance your knowledge about astral projection. 
Costs, Equipment Equipment-wise, all you need is a quiet space to help you concentrate and focus. You can use music to help you do this. Other than this, you really do not need anything to get started, except the will to do it. Some people do use external aids like binaural beats to help them meditate and reach the mind awake/body asleep state. You decide what you need. 
What Happens During A Projection? You are obviously curious to know exactly what happens in your body during an astral projection. Your pulse and heart rate are lowered. Your body temperature is also at its lowest. This reduces heat, generating energy that converts into magnetism, keeping us in. Your brain signals are slower, reducing electricity in the brain. Your breathing is much slower, passing on less oxygen to the brain. Thus, you need to keep three things in mind. 
Three Things to Keep in Mind Since the concept of astral projection can be an adventurous one, remember the following:  
Meditation This is the starting point for your astral projection training. You have to learn to meditate in the right manner because without it, you can’t get anywhere. You need to be adept at training your brain to reach its deep states of consciousness to enjoy an out of body experience.  
Target When you reach your state of meditation, you can focus on what your goal is through astral projection. Have a firm resolve and focus on it to help you leave your physical body. Then, use this intention to propel your astral body from your physical body.  
Focus While in your meditative state, focus on your goals and on achieving them. 

Astral projection is a wonderful experience. Free your mind, and enjoy the journey. 
Different Techniques Naturally, there are several routes or techniques when it comes to astral projection. There are several books that describe these techniques. Every individual finds that a particular technique works best for him or her – so it all boils down to some experimentation, until you arrive at the technique that suits you best and gives you results. You will hear about the following techniques: 

• Rope technique • Lift/roll out technique • Anchor technique • Swing technique • Meditation • Gradual detachment technique • Hypnotism • Affirmation • Chakra technique • Monroe technique 

In fact, every practitioner of astral projection will come up with a method. 

Whichever technique you choose, the common thread through these techniques is that your body’s energy influences your ability to project, the length of time you spend out of your body on the astral plane and the frequency you reach. 

Let’s look at the Monroe technique which is a good way to get started with astral projection for you as a beginner. 
Preparing yourself Preparing yourself is an essential step for your astral projection experience to be successful. You will need to practice this for a while so that you can gradually coax your body to let go of your astral body. 

• Start by learning how to meditate • Develop a regular routine. Sleep at the same time every night, and wake up at the same time every morning. • Sleep well. Get between eight to ten hours sleep every night. • Physical exercise helps by releasing your energy blocks, letting your energy flow freely through your body • Maintain a healthy diet. Avoid alcohol, hot and spicy foods. Cut down on meat. • Choose a time when you can try to project at the same time every day. Your body will appreciate this. • Just before you attempt astral projection, focus on it fully. Believe that you will achieve it and visualize yourself doing it. This will help you develop the right mindset. • Ensure there are no interruptions when you meditate. This means switching off your phone and not answering the doorbell. • As far as place is concerned, choose a quiet spot. You might want to visit the washroom before you begin meditating. 

It is very important to satisfy your body’s needs before you begin. 
The Meditation Lie down with your head in the geographical East. Get comfortable and relax your body. Your spine and neck must be straight. Use a pillow to support your head. Breathe, so that your breathing becomes rhythmic. Inhale, hold, then exhale, repeat. Breathe deeply and focus on your breathing. Feel each breath as it fills your lungs, taking the refreshing air through your body, as you relax completely. 

The next step is to relax your muscles. Here is an exercise that can help you with this. For a few seconds, clench your toes. Then loosen. As the fatigue flows through your muscles, repeat. Do this with all your muscles working your way up from the bottom to the top. This includes your legs, your buttocks, your belly, your chest, arms, neck, etc. Finish with your face. Stick your tongue out as far as you can. Make faces. Relax your eyes. Gradually, when your body becomes completely relaxed, you are ready for the main part of meditation. 
The Monroe technique for astral projection This technique was designed by Robert Allan Monroe based on his personal experiences in astral projection. This technique starts with completely relaxing the body as it is a vital requirement of your out-of-body experience. Use the meditation technique, gradual muscle relaxation or deep breathing exercises to relax. 

With a fully relaxed body, you are ready to step into the hypnogogic state, or the stage where you are on the verge of falling asleep. It is now time to consciously decide to go deeper into this state. Clear your mind of all thoughts and enjoy the darkness behind your closed eyes. This is the next step. Then, move into a deeper state of relaxation where you are no longer aware of your body or other stimulus. Right now all you are aware of are your thoughts. When you reach this state, you can enter the vibratory state where you experience a tingling sensation through your body indicating that you are ready for astral projection. 

You need to control your vibrations and channel them into waves so that you can slowly release parts of your astral body from your physical body. Begin with a hand or a foot, working your way up until your entire astral body leaves your physical body. You can now float away from your physical body or stand up. When you do this, it means you have had an out of body experience. 

There are guides that lead you through the minute details of this technique. Follow them with care. 
Beginners’ Tips to Keep in Mind When you attempt astral projection for the first time, stop with floating in the air or looking at your body. Drift down gradually and back into your physical body. Once you develop the knack, you will slowly be able to do it for longer durations. If you did not project successfully, remember to meditate and balance your being. 

The main thing to remember when you learn astral projection is that it is not all that difficult to do. You need patience and determination, along with the will to do it. No matter which method seems to work best, as we mentioned earlier, the main aspect of astral projection is meditating properly. It just takes longer for some people to achieve astral projection than others. 

If you find it really hard, try some meditation aids like music. Binaural beats are supposed to be effective. Persistence is the key to success. Now let’s look at some of the mistakes you must avoid when you try astral projection. 
Mistakes to Avoid Sometimes, even after you try for a long time, it seems like you are not getting anywhere with astral projection, check to see if you are doing anything wrong. Here are some mistakes you should avoid so that they don’t slow you down. 

• Do not attempt astral projection at night just before bedtime, as there are good chances of falling asleep. Most people tend to instantly drop off after a long and tiring day. Therefore, it can be difficult to achieve that state where your mind is awake and alert. Preferably try astral projection during the early afternoon or even during a weekend when you don’t have to rush off to work the next morning. • Do not be afraid to try astral projection. Some people have the latent fear of dying during astral projection. Some get scared of being possessed. Fears such as these can prevent you from fully allowing yourself to relax. Thus, get over these feelings before you start the process. • Do not keep talking to your self. Many people tend to keep up a constant stream of self talk where they ask themselves whether they are doing the right thing. To make sure astral projection is successful, it is important to free your mind from all thoughts. Only then will you be able to bring on the vibrations that precede the projection. Channel your thoughts to a single thread and listen without analyzing it. Focus steadily to get closer. • Do not confuse relaxation with sleep. In astral projection, you need to practice falling asleep physically, yet keeping your consciousness awake. This can take time to master. When your body sleeps, it reduces your magnetic pull as things slow down. When you free your mind of all thoughts, the vibrations flood it. Don’t get excited at this point. Continue to be calm until you can no longer feel your physical body. Allow your astral body to separate itself and keep focusing your consciousness on this. Do not listen to anything outside of the projection. • Do not be impatient. You cannot rush astral projection. For some people it can take a long time to achieve. It takes a lot of discipline, commitment and focus. Eventually it will happen and until it does, you have to be patient and wait without losing hope. 

Do keep the above in view to get closer to astral projection. It goes without saying that any distractions from your phones, your partners, your children or pets must be avoided. As mentioned earlier, get enough sleep in the Preparation stage so that you are not exhausted when you begin to try astral projection. 
Benefits of Astral Projection Astral projection seems like such a fun thing to do as a hobby, but it also brings some big benefits with it. It enriches your life in many ways. Here are some of the benefits you can enjoy: 

• You can feel the joy of flying and explore, without the constraints of time and distance. • You can pass through any physical matter safely and easily and this includes walls, vehicles, etc. • Astral projection allows you to meet your near and dear ones who are no longer alive. You can meet your spiritual guides and angels. • Astral projection will change the way you see life, bringing on a new awareness resulting in spiritual growth. • It is a fact that astral projection helps you travel in time and space. • You can heal others as well as yourself. Psychologically, it makes a big difference as you see yourself literally from outside of yourself, giving you the ability to let go of negative thoughts and habits. • It enhances your psychic abilities and extrasensory perception, making your life better by increasing your self awareness. • You no longer have the fear of death. Instead you appreciate life and enjoy it more. • You can influence others’ minds as astral projection gives you the ability to influence other people’s dreams. This requires mastery of technique. • You can help people solve problems that appear difficult, normally. You develop an increased sense of responsibility and self respect. You realize your true potential, power and strength. • You experience a change in your mental, spiritual and physical state, speeding up your personal development. Your intelligence is enhanced, your memory improves and so does your imagination. 

Most of all, there is a deep sense of awareness, rather than of belief. 
Conclusion Astral projection can often take months or years to achieve, so being patient is a pre-requisite to attempting this beautiful experience. As you get adept at the technique, you may feel like experimenting by trying a different diet to see if it affects your ability to project. At all times, remember that you must be respectful and act with common sense. View the astral plane as something that enriches your life. Understand the concept of the mind being awake while the body sleeps. Finally, it all depends on two major factors – your ability to compose your mind and body into a completely relaxed state and your ability to tune yourself to the right astral projection frequency. As you practice, you will get better and better. Enjoy the process.",
Insect-Spiders,"Insect-Spiders Information  Introduction Throughout the world, there is a huge fascination with pets, and this fascination covers all the different aspects of animals ranging from the common, like dogs and cats, to the feared, like snakes and reptiles, to the most intelligent, like parrots and rodents. But there is another category that is often pushed into the shadows and rarely spoken of. The hobby of insect collecting is one of the largest hobbies in the world and deals with all of the world’s creepy crawlers. From the beautiful butterfly to the giant hissing roach and from the Goliath Bird Eating Tarantula to the Giant Black Millipede, the secret world of insect is vast and varied in the creatures that the hobby covers. For those reading this that know a thing or two about tarantulas or scorpions, will already know that they aren’t technically insects, but are actually arachnids just like Giant Black Millipede is actually an arthropod, but the point is that we are using the term “insect collecting” to cover a board range of creatures that are kept by hobbyists. The more technical aspect of insect collecting is to collect insect from the wild, kill them using different types of gasses, and finally mounting them using a pin in corresponding groupings to showcase different species and subspecies. Although we will briefly describe this hobby, we will be focusing more on the collection of insects from the pet industry. Since the hobby is so vast, we will be focusing on the insects in general, as well as arachnids and anthropoids because they are the most likely to show up in a pet store. Unlike the case of literal insect collecting, we will discuss the ways to keep these “insects” as pets. 
Arthropods An arthropod is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages. For our purposes, we will be covering two of the most commonly available arthropods that are available in nearly every pet store that has a reptile department. There are perhaps 20 000 arthropods throughout the world, but the two most commonly found in pet stores are the African Giant Black millipede and the centipede. Although both would appear to be quite similar by someone new to the hobby, both are considerably different and you should never mix the two up. The main difference between the two is that the millipede is a herbivore and the centipede is a carnivore. Due to their dietary needs, the millipede is naturally extremely docile and the centipede is naturally extremely aggressive. The fact is that the centipede will deliver one of the worst bites you will ever experience and is capable of delivering a painful, deadly venom filled bite. So dangerous is the centipede that most pet stores simply will not bring one in unless it is a special order. But why is something so deadly and violent yet still desired? Despite their aggressive nature, they are one of the most beautiful creatures in the hobby. But the millipede is also not without its defense mechanisms as when it is attacks, it curls up into an armored ball and produces a toxin that secrets out of its sides. It is not harmful to humans, but helps it not become a meal in the wild. Monkeys in the wild have actually been documented of rubbing the chemical on their bodies to prevent mosquito bites. 

Although both of these arthropods’ diets are completely different, they can both be easily mimics in captivity. Since the millipede is a herbivore, their diet in captivity should consist of a variety of mixed greens and fruits and veggies. As with all animal species that are herbivores, the key to success is a large variety of food items to ensure your millipede gets all the nutrients that it requires. The centipede has the exact same diet as most commonly available tarantulas and scorpions. Their diet consists of live prey items, different types of crickets and worms, which they eat sporadically when they are hungry. It’s not uncommon for centipedes to simply kill a prey item and then refuse to eat it. Larger centipede can also eat small feeder rodents, live or pre-killed, to add a little bit of variety into their diet. 
Arachnids Arachnids are a class (Arachnida) of joint-legged invertebrate animals in the subphylum Chelicerata. All arachnids have eight legs.For our purposes, we are going to deal with two commonly available arachnids that are available in nearly every pet store that has a reptile department. Tarantulas and Scorpions are two types of arachnids that are usually found in pet stores. There are literally hundreds of each type, but the two most common are Rosy Tarantulas and the Emperor Scorpion. Why these two specifically? These are two of the most common because they are generally not aggressive and they’re venom won’t put you in a hospital if bitten. (Other similar tarantula species that are equal in terms of aggression are the Pink Toed Tarantula and the Red Kneaded Tarantula.) That’s right, both of these arachnids, like all tarantulas and scorpions have venom that they can deliver through a bite or a sting, but with these two types, their venom is no stronger than a bee sting and if you are allergic to bee stings, this is one animal that you should avoid. Although they can deliver a painful bite or sting, most would much rather retreat than deliver a bite. The other concern with these tarantulas is irritation and itching from special hairs found on some new world tarantulas. These tarantulas possess what are called ""urticating"" (itch-causing) hairs on their abdomens, which they can release by vigorously rubbing their abdomens if threatened. These tiny hairs are barbed and can work their way into the skin and cause itching and irritation. To ensure these hairs stay on the tarantula, stress is always something you have to keep to a minimum. 

The other major part about caring for these unusual creatures is that they do not shed their skin like reptiles or snakes, but rather goes into a full body molt. As a tarantula or scorpion grows, they routinely molt their entire exoskeleton and produces a new one. This is perhaps the most stressful time for a tarantula or scorpion, and it may lead to a heightened but temporary aggression. During this time, they require a high humidity, a daily misting with a water bottle is usually enough to suffice, and will also stop eating until the molt is complete. The scariest part of this process is when unsuspecting keeping see their arachnid lying on its back looking like it had recently died. Thankfully it hasn’t, but it does have to lie on its back, sometimes for hours on end, in wait for the new exoskeleton to harden. After the process is complete, you will have a fresh hungry arachnid on your hands, and the old skeleton will be waiting looking like a dead tarantula or scorpion. 

Diet for Tarantulas and scorpions are perhaps one of the easiest to mimic in captivity because they only eat live prey items. If you are squeamish about feeding live prey items, most common are crickets, then you should avoid arachnids if you already haven’t. For such large arachnids, they actually eat fairly little compared to other creatures. It is common to feed them every other day and usually only a few crickets at a time. Once they reach larger sizes, they are also able to eat small sized feeder rodent, either live or pre-killed. In the wild, the amount they eat is determined by how much they can catch. Most tarantulas require very little and in most cases will refuse to eat if they aren’t hungry, but scorpions, especially Emperor Scorpion, have a fondness for eating and are known to become obese in captivity. They also require a dish of water to be present in their enclosures at all times. For all arachnids, arthropods, and general insects, they need to have a sponge or cotton in their water to prevent accidental drowning. 
Purchasing Your First Arachnid/Arthropod The first rule about purchasing your first arachnids or arthropod is to buy a species that is interesting to you. Never be persuaded to purchase an animal that you don’t want because you are told it is an easier animal meant for a beginner. If it is an arachnids or arthropods that you don’t really want, then it is an animal that you will grow tired of in the future. Regardless of what type of arachnids or arthropod it is that you want, you have to ensure you do all the research about the animal prior to purchasing it so that you take proper care of the creature from day one. Care is a big issue, but research is doubly important for arachnids and arthropods because you have to make sure how aggressive it is, if it has venom and how much, and what it eats for a diet. Purchasing a colorful Tarantula is a great idea until you discover it attacks anything that comes close to it and has incredibly dangerous amounts of venom. For you own safety, and the safety of those around you, DO YOUR RESEARCH! 

One of the most debated issues in all of herpetology is whether to purchase from a private breeder or from a pet store. Here is an argument that is based on a few too many bad apples spoiling it for the bunch. Without pet stores, there simply would not be arachnids and arthropods in captivity as pets because it was various pet stores that sparked the interest in them in the first place. But over the past twenty years, there have been numerous cases of animals being sold by people thinking only of profit as their animals suffer from neglect. Thankfully, there has been numerous enthusiasts stepping forward to challenge pet stores that simply do not live up to the standards that all animals require, and there have also been numerous pet stores in North America that have been promoting proper arachnids and arthropod care. The downside to purchasing from a pet store is that you will be paying higher prices because the pet store purchases from breeders and then mark up the prices to make a profit. The other issue with arachnids and arthropods is that a majority of the species found in captivity are still being wild caught. Although there are many species being bred in captivity today, there are still thousands that have never been able to breed to live a long time in captivity. As the industry advances, a majority of arachnids and arthropods will be captive bred, but for the time being, many arachnids and arthropods are being imported into North America. 

As a general rule of thumb, always try to purchase the healthiest animal available. This is easily done by purchasing the largest arachnids or arthropods in a group that is active and regularly feeding. Larger arachnids and arthropods typically mean that they are being well fed and cared for. If an arachnids and arthropods is skinny and not active, then it is best to leave it be. Although most arachnids and arthropods are nocturnal, it is important that they are alert when uncovered or picked up. One of the most common reasons for buying a small sickly animal from either a breeder or pet store is because you want to save it and nurse it back to health. Although noble your intentions might be, a life time of health issues will not make you love your animal more, and health issues in arachnids and arthropods are incredibly difficult to treat especially if it is a young animal that has yet to build up a resistance to illnesses. A healthy arachnids and arthropods can live many years, and if you put in the time that is necessary, you will be rewarded in the long run. Since a number of these animals are wild caught, it is important to check them for mites that may have come from the wild. Mites are incredibly resourceful and difficult to get rid of, and they can cause enormous amounts of stress to your animal. 
Required Equipment All arachnids and arthropods, regardless of species, require three main things to ensure that they not only survive, but thrive in their new home. The first thing that they require is an enclosure that is big enough for them to stretch out it, but also to mimic their natural ecosystem. For most arachnids and arthropods the space they require is typically quite small. Most species are perfectly happy to live in a 10-20 gallon tank for most of their lives, but some, like the Goliath Bird Eater needs at least twice that size since it has a 12 inch leg span. Most will require a shot enclosure with a lot of ground space, whereas some species prefer to climb and stay in the tree, which require taller enclosures. Since most of these species require high or moderate amounts of humidity, the substrate of choice is either dirt or a humid cypress mulch. Most important of all, especially if you want to keep you arachnids and arthropods in the cage, you have to have a tight fitting lid that they can’t push up or squeeze through. The fact of the matter is, if they can escape, they will, and just because you can’t see them trying, they are trying as hard as they can to escape. 

The second thing to remember about arachnids and arthropods is that they are cold blooded, so they require an external heat source to keep their bodies warm. Without a heat range of 75 f to 80 f (For most Species), your arachnids or arthropods will be stressed out and will not be able to digest its food properly. A lot of times when an animal refuses to eat, it is because their temperature is simply too low for their metabolism to function properly. This heat can be from an external reptile heat bulb to heat the cage from above, or you can choose to use a heat mat to heat the cage from below. It is important to heat only one half of the cage give your pet a chance to regulate its body temperature by being able to move from one side of the cage to another. 

The last thing you have to remember is that arachnids and arthropods like to feel secure. They do this by curling up underneath things that they can push up against and feel safe. The easiest way to do this is to purchase reptile hides from a pet store, like the ones that look like big hollow rocks that your pet can climb under. These are the easiest to use, most effective, and the safest. Some people choose to use real rocks, which are alright, but you have to ensure they cannot be pushed over because they can and will easily crush an arachnids or arthropods. And again, arachnids and arthropods like to regulate their temperatures, so it is important to have one hiding spot on the cool side of the cage, and a hiding spot on the hot side of the cage. 
Conclusion Although they can be some of the most feared, and in some cases, deadly animals in the world, arachnids and arthropods are some of the most sought after creatures for hobbyist’s collections. Although the hobby of “insect collecting” is the collection of insects, most often butterflies and beetles due to their unique colorations, followed by humanly killing them to prevent exoskeleton damage, and then mounting them in their species and subspecies groups. This is a hobby that has gone on for decades, but the keeping of arachnids and arthropods alive in enclosures is a considerably new hobby that calls for a lot of attention to detail. With thousands of tarantulas, scorpions, millipedes, and centipedes on the market, it is essential to do a lot of research to ensure what you are purchasing is what you want. Although care for all of them is generally the same, it is the dietary requirements that are the most necessary to know because it will also tell you what their general temperament is like. Where the millipede is a herbivore and very docile, the centipede is a carnivore and quite aggressive. That’s not to say that you should avoid aggressive or venomous arachnids or arthropods, it is more to say that there is a lot of respect that should be given to all these creatures because they are all unique in their own way. This is one hobby that turns your greatest fears against you in a way that is completely fascinating. Just when you think a tarantula or scorpion is not personal, they begin to watch you and come out when they thing you have food. Plus the less aggressive species of tarantulas, scorpions, and most millipedes don’t mind being held for short periods of time and sometimes like the amount of heat your body gives off. Its actually quite strange when you realize a big that you bought from a pet store has actually become a family pet that you love just as much as any other dog or cat.",
Tattoo,"Tattoo Information  Definition and History A tattoo is a marking made by inserting dark ink into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment for decorative purposes. 
The Tattoo as Art In order for a tattoo to become a true work of art, the client must be completely resolved to offer up a part of his body as a canvas. Anyone who truly wants a quality tattoo will do his homework and do a lot of planning. (This is especially true of custom work, where there is not already a stencil available or where the client is adding further design to an already-existing tattoo.) Reputable tattoo artists have portfolios of their work available for customers to thumb through to ensure that their style of work is compatible with what the client has in mind. Some artists (especially beginners) are best at sticking to single-dimension stencil work, while the more advanced artists are amazingly adept at doing custom work using shadings, dimension, and on wide variety of themes. 

The location of the tattoo will say a lot about its wearer. Small, modest, token tattoos on the inside of a wrist, around a ring finger, or on the chest can signify something personal to the wearer only. Those who are following a certain culture and who are a bit braver might have a simple band tattooed around their arm or ankle. But for those interested in making a work of art of their bodies, the possibilities are endless. Especially popular in the early 21st century is the complex, full-coverage work on the arms called “sleeves.” Though the work must be done in two or more sittings, the artist works with his client to customize a combination of many designs that meld together into a unique, colorful masterpiece that is meant to be worn any way but hidden. Some of the larger artwork works best when tattooed over the shoulder, upper or lower back, or on the calf of the leg. A seasoned artist will be comfortable with any suggestions or pre-printed ideas that are brought into the parlor; he will be able to make any necessary modifications or create a freehand piece to make a personalized stencil. 

The range of topics for tattoos is as wide as the imagination itself. Fairies are a particularly popular subject for women, as are dragon scales, skulls, and tribal shapes for men. Native American designs are very popular in the United States. And the Japanese and Chinese continue to have a great influence on tattoo art, as well. In the Western world, the sailor’s tattoo has given way to even more “macho” designs, sometimes in the most painful of places, such as the neck, the inside of the upper arm, and the head. It is possible for entire sagas to be spelled out in ink, spilling down from neck to ankle, much as history is conveyed on the Bayeux Tapestry or the Parthenon Frieze. Women are less likely to do this but rather choose to wear graceful designs across their lower backs, calves, or feet. In many cases the tattoos will be in inconspicuous places to signifying commitment. In The Illustrated Woman (published in 1992), William de Michele states, “Tattoos signify commitment. As permanent marks, they generally indicate some personal transition of significance. Often this relates to efforts to gain or regain control of one’s life.” For example, a woman who goes through a divorce might do this to make her body different for a new husband. 

Is tattoo truly an art? Considering there are now entire tattoo conventions devoted to the practice and galleries (online and off) of freehand work, it would seem so. Can it be distasteful? Of course, if the wearer is not wearing it “for art’s sake” and has some bone to pick with society. But tattoos have been worn even among royalty and politicians (King Harold II, King Edward VII, Tsar Nicholas of Russia, Thomas Edison, Sir Winston Churchill, Winston Churchill’s mother, ex-US Secretary of State George Shultz, and Barry Goldwater, for example). More than thirty million North Americans, alone now bear tattoos, from the rich down through the middle class and beyond. There is no longer the stigma associated with body markings as in earlier times. But whether you decide to wear one or make a hobby of collecting many tattoos, consider the saying “think before you ink.” It is much more difficult to remove a tattoo than it is to get one. 

Here are a couple quotes regarding the art and significance of the tattoo: 

You may lose your most valuable property through misfortune in various ways. You may lose your house, your wife and other treasures. But of your moko, you cannot be deprived except by death. It will be your ornament and companion until your last day. ~Netana Whakaari of Waimana 

A tattoo is a true poetic creation, and is always more than meets the eye. As a tattoo is grounded on living skin, so its essence emotes a poignancy unique to the mortal human condition. ~V. Vale and Andrea Juno, Modern Primitives",
Motocross,"Introduction to MotocrossMotocross is a type of racing in which the participant uses a motorcycle sport or all terrain vehicles. The races are held on enclosed areas that are off any roadways. The first races were actually trials and were called scrambles, but the name was later changed to motocross, a combination of the French word “moto” and the word “cross-country.” For those who are interested in racing with non-motorized dirt bikes, BMX or bicycle motocross is the equivalent sport.Motocross involves a great deal of speed and competition which have helped it become one of the most popular in the extreme sports categories. Motocross is also referred to as dirt biking and can assume many different forms beginning with races and up through expeditions on mountain trails. The sport is very demanding and as such creates great strength and physical condition within the upper body. If you are the type of person who loves speed, you will definitely love Motocross. It doesn’t matter whether you enjoy freestyle riding or racing, you can find many online resources that will help you learn the basics and how to get started in Motocross.
  Riding Safety One of the most important things you need to do with you are on a bike is protect yourself. One of the most important steps in safety is to make sure your gear fits properly. Your safety gear will provide little protection if it is ill-fitting because you will focus more on how uncomfortable the safety gear is instead of focusing your attention where it should be: the road and your bike. When you choose your gear always buy the correct size—don’t be concerned about whether you might gain or lose weight in the future; you need to buy what fits now in order to assure the best comfort and safety while you are riding. If you are unsure what size you should purchase, ask your motocross vendor—he is experienced in this area and can provide you the sizes in order to ensure both safety and a comfortable fit.In addition to obtaining properly-fitting gear, it is also a good idea to invest in some quality earplugs. While you are riding you will have to endure noises that vary from the wind zipping by to those noises the bike itself generates, and even though you may find a helmet that promises a quiet and smooth ride, it will still be necessary to wear earplugs for additional protection. With noises from the wind as well as your bike you could very easily damage your ears and ultimately your hearing.Another essential part of your protective gear is a helmet that meets or exceeds both Snell and DOT certification. This means the helmet has undergone a variety of tests and still looks like a helmet rather than something that is completely unrecognizable. It is essential for the helmet to fit well on your head—you don’t want one that is too tight or too loose. There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to helmets—heads come in different sizes. In order to determine the correct fit measure the size of your head just above your eyebrows—better yet, take the time to visit a store that sells quality helmets and try one on for the perfect fit.You will also need a jacket, gloves and boots in order to protect your hands, fingers and body from any debris that may be flying through the air while you are riding. In addition if you should get into a spill with your bike (and everyone does at some time or another), the jacket and gloves can help you avoid nasty injuries. While you may have your own preference, Fox Racing offers a complete line of protective gear while Alpinestars manufactures high quality boots.",
Skateboarding,"Skateboarding Information  Intro What can make you feel more elated and joyful than zooming around on your skateboard? You’ve probably watched the world famous Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen, Ryan Sheckler, Paul Rodriguez and the like – and wanted to take up skateboarding as a hobby and perhaps even become good enough to enter competitions. Today, skateboarding is one of the most popular sports and there’s no specific age in which you must start learning. 
The Origin Of Skateboarding If you are wondering when the first ever skateboard was made, it was in the 1950s by Hobie Alter, when what was called ‘sidewalk surfing’ was popular in California. When there wasn’t any surfing to do, skateboarding was born. People used flat planks of wood, fixed them to roller skate trucks, and moved in a style similar to the skateboarding, as we know it now. It gradually grew to become the extreme sport it is today. The most wonderful thing about skateboarding is that it is constantly evolving – and it is hardly surprising that more and more people are getting interested in this invigorating sport. 
Now, How Can YOU Get Started? If you are new to skateboarding, it might seem tough at first – both in terms of where to look for help, how you can learn all those dexterous tricks the pros perform so easily, what attire and accessories to buy, etc. Here’s a look at what you might need: 

First, buy a pair of skate shoes. Even though regular shoes can be comfortable, skate shoes are better as they are specially built to help you skate safely. Skate shoes have a flat large base so that you can get a good grip on the board and are built stronger. Next, you will require a helmet. You’ll find most of the skate parks insist on them for your safety. You can also go in for protective pads for your elbows and knees, and wrist braces. You can either buy or borrow a skateboard and you are ready to get started. 

You will need to find a reputed coach who can teach you the right techniques in safe surroundings. Skate camps are a good idea, as they will not only teach you to skateboard but also the most popular tricks and tips through focused training. Most of these camps are well equipped with huge street courses. There are also mini-ramps, bowls and convenient places to practice on for the Newbies. Since this is a skill that comes with a lot of practice, you must remember that it could be a while before you master the skateboarding tricks. 

It is very important to get used to riding your skateboard first so that you can push, stand, come to a halt and turn with ease. You must learn to put the right foot forward when you ride your skateboard and also learn to push in the right manner. It is only after you ride comfortably that you can move on to learning the tricks. Some popular tricks you will see are the Ollie, kick flips, backside 180s, front side 180s and heel flips. One thing is guaranteed – you will have a lot of fun in the process. Each person has his or her personal pace of learning, so don’t get too bothered about the amount of time it takes you to learn a particular trick – all that matters is for you to enjoy the process, because, with that comes your style. Get your stance on your skateboard right and the rest of it has to do with practice. 
Choosing Your Skateboard Depending on the kind of skateboarding you intend doing, you can buy the appropriate deck and accessories. You can choose to go street skateboarding, transitions skateboarding or all around skateboarding which is a mix of the earlier two - – but the main thing is to be comfortable with the board you buy. 

You can buy your skateboard from your local store. The 7.75-inch deck is an average size that suits a majority of aspiring skateboarders for starters. In addition to this, you will require accessories like bearings, wheels, trucks and grip tape. You can go in for medium suspension as far as the trucks go since you need to decide whether you’ll be a street skater or a park skater. Get everything assembled by the store guy and you are ready to go on your very first skateboard. You can get used to the board by rolling around on a safe surface. Most people practice off the sidewalk by planting their feet on the board and then pushing off. 

It’s the best way to learn to balance on your skateboard. If you are dedicated enough, you will soon find the most comfortable stance for you on the board. Don’t get disheartened by a few falls – just pick yourself up and keep at it. When you find it easy to roll around – you are ready to learn the tricks. 
Skateboarding Tricks You Start Off With Some tricks you learn in the beginning are the Ollie, the Nollie, the Kick flip, the heel flip and so on. An Ollie involves popping the board and moving your front foot toward the front of the board. When you move your foot to the back of the board, it’s a nollie. The kick flip involves spinning the board vertically towards you. When you spin it away from you, it’s a heel flip.",
Shark Diving,"Shark Diving Information  Introduction So you’re looking for a new hobby? Already decided that collecting stamps isn’t exciting enough and collecting coins simply doesn’t give you the thrill that you’re after? You’ve finally decided that you want to learn more about shark diving and take it up as a hobby. Great! Why not jump start the adrenaline by reading more about shark diving below, but remember, it’s not exactly collecting stamps; it’s swimming with one of earth’s most powerful predators. 

While diving in shark infested waters was an activity limited to science researchers in the past, it’s quickly becoming a popular hobby amongst sea diving enthusiasts and adrenalin junkies. In fact, diving with sharks over the years has evolved and turned into one of the hottest hobbies to have. Businesses across the globe are booming thanks to shark diving; South Africa the best example of such: it’s become the number 1 go-to spot for shark-diving. And as a result, the country enjoys over $30 million EVERY YEAR from tourists who are looking to nab a glance of the wild sharks and divers who are looking for some action underwater with some cage-less diving. Now, add to that list the increasing hobbyists who are excited to get their thrills from swimming with the underwater beasts. 
Understanding Cage Diving There are numerous ways to actually dive with sharks, but two of the more popular methods are cage diving and cage-less diving. Cage diving is by far the safest method which, contrary to popular belief does not restrict your view or make the experience any less fun. On the contrary, with cage diving, you’ll still be close enough to get in a shark’s face, only without the dangers of doing so! The cage that you hop into with usually no more than 4 other divers is rectangular in shape and can usually be found off the side or back of a boat. It’s made of reinforced aluminum and remains attached to the side of the boat at all times, so you won’t drift off into sea by mistake. 

A shark proof cage is an extremely strong metal cage used to safely see sharks up close. The cages are built to survive repeated attacks by large and very powerful sharks. 

While it is safe to dive near sharks of most species, diving with great whites requires great care. The most common approach is for divers to stay within their steel cage. 
Equipment, gear and guts. If you’re thinking of taking up cage diving with the kings of the seas as a hobby, there are a few things you will need. The absolute first thing you’ll need to get a rip on before taking the plunge is fear. You have to grab fear by the neck and wrestle it to the ground before diving. Leave it behind, it won’t do anything but get in the way of the awesome experience to be had. 

Once you shed that fear, some of the basic equipment you will need consist of: 

• Wetsuit: A wetsuit is very useful in areas where the water temperature is low. 

• Snorkel or alternatively scuba gear: this allows you to breath under water and get a better view. 

• Lead Belt or a weighted one: Used to stay below water. Yes, that’s it. That’s all you’ll need to get close and personal with the kings of the sea. You might not need the snorkel gear if the boat you’re on is equipped with its own on-boat snorkel function which is known as a hookah air system. Basically, it’s a mask with a hose that extends into the boat, you wear the mask and the hose that remains attached on the boat which pumps air through to you. This pretty much rids you of having to carry an air tank and it’ll regulate air intake for you and do all the work, you just have to remember to breath when you see those sharks coming your way! 

You want to record video instead of a camera and if you do take a camera, it goes without saying that keeping the flash on is not the smartest move. The last thing you want to do is intimidate or provoke the sharks. Plus, using video to capture everything, High Definition for best impact, will capture every second of the thrill and you can then easily edit the High Def video for single perfect shots. If you don’t own a waterproof camcorder get a diving case for the camera, they’re sold at most diving shops and come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. 

The cage you’ll be in as mentioned before is important since it is the only thing between you and a group of sharks. Here’s a list of some interesting facts you might want to know about the cage you’ll be in: 

• Almost all cages are made out of aluminum and steel that’s melded for extra reinforcement. 

• Most cages are about 10feet in length and 3 in width. 

• Cages are rectangular in shape, this means you’re never too far away from the boat, and as there will be about 4 of you in there, more than enough room to stand side by side and still have space to move around and follow the sharks as they circle the cage. 
You’re in the water, now what? You’re in the cage, you’re ready and you wait wondering how the sharks know you’re there and when you’ll see them. They don’t sniff you out, if that’s what you’re thinking. That’s not how it works, you’re not in the cage as bait, even though it might ‘look’ that way. You just wait for them to stroll by and the boat you’re on, the charter, they make sure the sharks follow them and know they’re around. They simply do this by trailing a fish blood/oil scent behind the boat till the sharks sniff it out. It smells delicious to sharks and with their amazing sense of smell they’ll follow the scent to the boat. 

Most sharks usually appear further away from the boat, slowly moving and circling. You’ll start to see shadows being cast and then a large form will appear and the shark will come into view. Usually you’ll see several at the same time, so don’t be alarmed. 

Once the sharks are there for you to see, a box with a beautiful fish aroma is held off the back of the boat to keep the sharks roaming around the boat looking for the fish, long enough for you to get your thrills! You’ll watch them go round the boat, circle back and forth while safely within the cage. Usually the dive lasts anywhere from 15minutes to half an hour and that’s more than enough time for you to take photos, and just capture the moment, really let it sink in. 
Cage-less Diving with Sharks For the more extreme hobbyists, you might be looking to really get that adrenalin flowing and there’s no better way to do that than diving with the sharks, minus the big safe cage we discussed above. That’s right, it’ll be just like swimming with the dolphins, only these are sharks we’re talking about. There’s nothing more exciting, breath taking and truly mind blowing than swimming with the sharks in their own domain. No reinforced steel diving cage, nothing to bait them with, it’s only the sharks and you in their backyard, the ocean. Some sharks are so welcoming and friendly they’ll touch you as the swim by but remember, patting a shark on the back is a little like patting an unaware tiger, even a tame one at the zoo, you’ll spook them! 

While all this may sound like a dream come true for some of you, this activity is only available in a few locations around the world. Then again, this isn’t a hobby for the faint of heart so the excitement you’ll experience alone may justify booking a trip for this. 

Some important points you need to keep in mind when you go diving with sharks in the open sea without a cage. Remember, you’re not in a cage, so you just can’t dive into a pool of circling sharks and expect them to welcome you with open...fins. Most resorts and companies that take you open sea shark diving require you to be certified to scuba dive in the open sea. It’s not as big a deal as you think, it’s just about proving to the authorities at be that you can scuba dive and take care of yourself in the big blue ocean. 

Now you’ll need some equipment:
• Wetsuit 

• Air Tank 

• Air Regulator 

• Blunt object or stick, keep that harpoon at home you won’t need it. 

Yes, you’re looking at that last requirement and wondering why on Earth you would need a blunt stick of sorts if thousands of people dive with sharks in the open waters. It’s safe, but you can’t simply put aside the fact that sharks are wild animals. Any wild animal, be it a shark, or bear, or even a wild horse, is unpredictable and dangerous. 

It’s all about how you act around the sharks, how you move, what you wear and how you react and even how you swim around them. Think about it, you’re in their home, you’re the guest, take that and ask yourself a few questions. 

• Would you be happy if someone dropped by uninvited and started jumping around in your living room? No. So when you’re around sharks, in their living room, don’t make any sudden movements. Let them question you, swim around you, they’ll be more at ease. 

• Would you be more threatened by a human being or a bird? This question is a confusing one but what’s meant by it is sharks don’t give much thought to lower taller creatures. If you’re floating horizontally and the sharks mistake you for a species of fish then they’ll consider you an intruder in their domain. So stay as low to the ground as you can by using belt weights and standing up right. 

• Are you threatened more by a single person walking towards you or a group of people you don’t know? When diving with other divers in a group, try to remain in sight but keep a distance from each other. Don’t overwhelm the sharks that way they’ll become nervous. 

Last but not least, enjoy yourself; you’re rubbing shoulders with one of the most feared, misunderstood, powerful creatures on earth. Sharks are just curious creatures, they’re friendly and as long as you don’t spook them, they’ll be welcoming. Being so close to them in open water will give you a truly new opinion about these sharks. 
The Sharks There are over 370 different species of sharks so you’ll meet plenty. It’s important to read up on the sharks in the area you plan to dive just to be in the know how. Some sharks accept colourful clothing while others consider it food so remember to always wear dark wetsuits, just to be on the safe side. While all these sharks are safe to swim with, even the great white, it’s important to remember one main point: Sharks are Predators. Sure, they’ll let you swim with them but sharks aren’t as harmless as goldfish or salmons, or any other innocent fish. They’re sharks; respect them, they’ll show you respect back but always stay vigilant! 

Now remember there are ways to stay safe in case a shark is provoked and you find yourself in a dangerous position. The main point to keep in mind is that you have to fight the shark off. Playing dead as many tell you about bear attacks won’t work with sharks, don’t make it easy for the shark to bite you. If you have a spear, blunt object or something in hand then use that on either the shark’s nose or eyes. Aiming for the gills will do the trick too. 

The nose, eyes, gills are the three spots are where the shark is most sensitive. By hitting the shark in one of these three areas will disorient the shark long enough for you to get away. Now if the shark does leave make your way up to the surface slowly all the while remaining vigilant. Keep scouting the area around you as you head to the surface in case the shark decides to turn back. 

Scary as all that may seem, cage diving is of course safer than open sea diving without a cage. It’s like anything in life, traveling by plane, boat or walking across the street, nothing is 100% safe. So if it’s diving with sharks you’re after to take up as a new hobby, you’re prepared to go at it now, enjoy yourself, take in the moment and thrill.",
General Martial Arts,"General Martial Arts Information  Introduction A martial art refers to a form of fighting that has a distinct code. This code will, at the very least, set down moves that can be learned, trained, and utilized by its practitioners.

It originated from Japan. This type of martial arts uses kicking, throwing, kneeing, choking holds and numerous sort of tools. The word Jujitsu is a mixture of two Japanese language words. 

1- Ju: means mild or flexible (soft) way to transfer or respond to the aggression of the attacker. 

2- Jitsu: means way or art of using the energy or power from your opponent attack. 

It is believed that the basis of jitsu primarily depends upon various types of martial arts which was inherited by Japanese from Asia.   Uniform or Dress 

There is no proper uniform or dress for jitsu. 

Martial arts weapons: 

There are several hundred weapons for martial arts. Weapons vary from type to type or style to style. 

The most common used weapons are Nunchacku, Steel Blade Kama, Martial arts gloves, Round Chrome Sai, Kung Fu Swords, octagon Sai, Dulo-Dulo, Tai Chi Swords, Action Flex Nunchaku, Garrote ,Rubber Knife, Wood Knife, Samurai Swords and Wooden Bokken. 

These weapons are available in various color, style and sizes. They are mainly used for self-defense. 
Three major areas of Martial Arts As stated before, a martial art will utilize striking, grappling, and/or the use of weapons. Many will specialize in only one of these areas, while others may train in all three. Most commonly, the art will have an emphasis on one major area.  
Striking Nearly every area will have a rudimentary form of striking. However, exceptions do exist. Wrestling in nearly all western forms are a good example to this exception. 

The primary goal to using a strike is simple. Hit your opponent in a vulnerable area to incapacitate them. For some of the more lethal arts, this may include killing the individual. Even in the direst situations is this practiced. Many martial arts in the armed forces don’t incorporate the use of deadly force unless no other alternative is available. 

Due to the possibility of death, many martial arts will reserve the most lethal techniques for the highest level practitioners of the art. By doing this, they can be confident that the practitioner is responsible and mature enough to know the proper use of what they have learned. 

The following are some examples of martial arts that specialize in striking. Notice that these techniques are practiced with padded gear to prevent more serious injury. 

Examples of striking styles 

Striking with feet: Kick Boxing. 

Striking with hands: Boxing.  
Grappling Given the deadly power of striking, other forms of techniques were developed. Not only do grappling styles still have the ability to disable an opponent, but many can be used in tight quarters. 

The ability to strike greatly diminishes when a person is given less space. However, a grappler will gain a huge advantage by being closer to the other person. What is more, these styles can utilize different physiques. 

Wrestling favors strength. Although speed does give an added benefit if the strength of both opponents are equal. However, judo will focus on skill. By directing the power of their opponent they’ll triumph. 

Both of these martial arts are grappling varieties. This demonstrates that no matter the area of specialty, there is no one correct way to fight. This also gives you the option of how you would like to improve yourself. 

Examples of grappling styles 

Throwing: Glima, Jujutsu, Sambo, Judo 

Joint lock/Submission holds: Aikido, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Hapkido, Judo 

Pinning Techniques: Wrestling, Judo  
Weaponry From swords to staves, all forms of weaponry can be typically found in a martial art. The implementation of these weapons expands on the concept of striking. However, the modification that weapons provide, results in the need for training. 

Left untrained in any weapon, a person would be more likely to do harm to themselves. Many martial arts have to implant the idea that the weapon is an extension of yourself. 

Consider this; we as humans are a mediocre create naturally. We can swim, but we are not as fast as a seal. We can run, but an average horse can beat the best human runner and so on. However, the one thing we have over the natural kingdom is our intelligence. 

We have the ability to modify ourselves to compensate for our deficiency. A sword is an artificial claw. A staff is an extension to our limbs. A shield serves as a carapace that we weren’t born with. 

Keeping this concept in mind, if we want to utilize these new features we must become accustomed to them. This is where the martial arts come into play. As babies we needed to figure out how to walk. So too do we need to become aware of the potential of the weapon we hold. 

Of course, the use of weapons is vastly more dangerous than learning to use your body in new ways. Because of this, more protective gear is typically needed when learning these forms of martial arts. 

Examples of weaponry styles 

Traditional Weaponry: Eskrima, Fencing, Gatka, Kendo, Kyūdō 

Modern Weaponry: Jukendo The most common use of martial arts today can be found in competitions. Whether the individual is competing against practitioners of the same martial discipline or against mixed formats, the idea of a competitive event is what is accepted in today’s society. 

Each competitive event will allow the participants to attain a goal. This could involve medals, belts, trophies, titles, or ranking system. All of these methods give the individuals participating to display their proficiency and drive to win. 

Another level to martial arts competitions involves differing degrees of intensity. Certain events will only allow light contact, while others require medium or even full contact. These differing levels will determine how a contest is handled. 

Light and medium contact levels are mostly judged on points. The goal in these conditions is to touch vulnerable areas which are scored in various ways. Each martial art will determine the point for the spot touched cleanly. The head and chest are just two examples of areas that many fighting styles view as highly vulnerable and therefore highly valued areas to score on. 

A full contact sport will still keep a track of points. However, these points are usually only used in determining ties. The objective of most full contact martial arts is to knock the opponent out or make them submit. These forms of competition are extremely dangerous and result in a short career as a martial artist for many. 
The various sporting styles Only a hand full of martial arts has been recognized by the world as a proper event. These few art styles are held as Olympic events in the summer games. On this level of competition the art it is partly shadowed by national pride in ones country. 

As such, many martial arts whose focus is based on morale principles shy away from promoting themselves in such venues. These martial arts tend to view events like the Olympics as a way that may degrade their art form. 

Another style of competition, primarily favored by eastern martial arts, is a non-combative display. This will vary depending on the principles taught by the particular art. Breaking bricks or following a routine known as a kata, are examples of this type of competitive display. Scoring is based on clean breaks and/or excellence of form. Many even view these forms of events as dance. 
Mixed martial arts Mixed martial art is one of the world’s most fast growing games. It is now everywhere, no matter where you are, you can have its training centers near you. In spite of the fact that this game is gaining its popularity at a very fast pace, still people are ignorant of its basic rules and regulations. Initially this game was not liked by the general masses and they used to find it as a game which is all about bloodshed but then later on its image improved. The reason behind their distaste for it was that there used to be no rules in the game and the players were supposed to fight with other like beasts in the cage. The poor players were generally badly hurt in the game and used to have their bones fractured. At that time even the referee didn’t know what to do and what his role was in the game. Later on due to the emergence of certain rules and regulations, this particular sport got its approval and now it is known world over. 

Nowadays the youngsters who are interested in pursuing it as a career must know one thing that they should have mixed martial art training. It is a must for them or else they cannot survive in the game as it is becoming tougher and tougher and more challenging. 
Use of martial arts on Modern battlefield It is a question that is raised very often that what is the use or the practical application of mixed martial arts. There are so many fighting techniques that are being taught and have no practical use. They are just so much out dated but on the contrary mixed martial arts is not like that so. It is applied even today as well. During the Second World War it was commonly practiced by the army, more over US army, Canadian army and many other countries asked for the services of mixed martial arts trainers to train their soldiers. Even today as well, when any country has to send its troop to a very tough location or to a location where there is a lot of resistance. There the troops are given mixed martial arts training because it is not easy for a normal soldier to cope up with such a harsh environment. 
Competition and Testing Testing and evaluation is required in one form or the other. It could be the necessity for many reasons, like the student wants to know how much he or she has learnt so far or where are they standing amongst the class. This may also be required for the instructor to evaluate his/ her students as well. The evaluation is done by the instructor and as far as the evaluation criterion is concerned it actually varies a lot from type to type since there are hundreds of types of martial arts. In order to distinguish between different ranks based on knowledge, generally belts are used. White belt signifies the least and black shows that you are the master in it. 

In order to evaluate any of the kind of martial arts, the instructor will either be making decision using form or sparring. These two terms are generally not very familiar. In ‘Forms’ the student will be performing certain acts but these acts are generally predefined. The student can perform these acts either solo or it could be with an instructor. In this type of testing mechanism the student is suppose to perform some very specialized acts and the more the act is difficult to execute, the more the points the student gets. 

Sparring is further divided into two types 

1) Light or medium contact 

2) Full contact 

As the name suggests, in light contact the competitors are ought to follow more strict rules and regulations than full contact. In light contact, the competitors are told not to hit each other in the eyes or groin. In fact there are certain zones that are prohibited for the competitors to hit each other on. More over there are certain moves as well that are not allowed. The judges evaluate the players on the basis of the scores they make within a specified interval of time. In full contact, the competitors are least restrained by rules and regulations as there are very few rules they need to abide like the players can hit each other anywhere except the groin. There are also few movements that are not allowed like biting etc but this match is more intense. 

The basic difference between form and sparring is this that in ‘form’ the fight that the competitors fight is predictable. Their bodies moves are already known to the competitor but in ‘sparring’ the moves are not known to the opponent. Every move is random and is based on the opponent’s move. 
Advantages of martial arts There are so many benefits of this sport that it is really impossible to tell each and every one of them. Here are few of them. 

The first and foremost benefit that you get is this that you can protect yourself from the intruder in spite of being unarmed. 

It also acts as a very good exercise as well. It not only keeps you physically fit but also internally as it also constitutes some rhythmic breathing exercises and ways to overcome mental stress and pressure. Workouts involved in martial arts trainings increase immune system that helps our body to protect from various ailments. Recently physiotherapist to make sure that injuries and wound heels with perfect and in less time has also adopted it. In simple, martial arts provides us with uncountable benefits that can never be achieved via some other exercise. 
What you need to get started There are a number of ways through which one can learn martial arts. You can do self-learning or join a martial arts school or center. Self-learning of martial arts can be done at home. You can take help from CDs/ DVD, books or even online. Nowadays, there are many website which offers guidance to you and allows to you learn at your home. These websites has lessons and step by step guide for beginners. Most of these Martial arts websites are free to join. 

The other option is to join a martial arts center or school. There are various schools and centers in which you can enroll. You can enroll in a general program or can even join a specific program. For this decide the style or technique you want to learn. There are many schools or centers which allow the guest to various styles and choose accordingly. Make sure you do that in order to make the decision. You will also get an idea about the school or center itself and the environment with this. 

Occasionally, schools, both grade school and college level, will offer classes in certain arts. Wrestling for instance is primarily available only through academic channels. Other more extreme forms may have you join an organization. Many military styles exist, but will only be given access to eligible personnel, i.e. members of that particular military organization. 

Once you have found a martial art that is accessible to you, you can then proceed to do a more in-depth study of it. Keep in mind that many martial arts will share principles with a particular religious belief. If you take offense with these practices, it’s better to find out as soon as possible. This is not always the case. 

Martial arts studios that pride themselves on competitions will more than likely have a greater focus on training and less on religion. Typical religious doctrine is usually only loosely followed in any case. However, the last thing any martial art would promote is for you to compromise your own beliefs. 

Provided the martial art meets your needs, both physically and mentally, you can then determine the gear you’ll need. The amount of equipment needed will vary both in cost and practicality. 

Training dummies that help you learn sword and shield techniques are not typically something you can find at your local store. Not to mention, someone qualified in the art form may be somewhat problematic to find. 

Nearly every discipline will have their own specific uniform for training. Many eastern styles are simple with only a gi, martial arts uniform, and belt as the official clothing. Where as, wrestling will call for a singlet, special shoes, mouth guard, head gear, and possibly a few more pads and/or supports, can cost you a great deal more money. 

By doing a small amount of investigation, it’s relatively easy to judge how much you’ll actually need. Certain martial arts studios can provide literature on what they offer and also what is required by students. If not, feel free to ask. These studios are always looking to help someone new to their craft and provide information readily. 

Whatever your decision, you should never under estimate that any martial art offers. The following briefly covers some of these benefits that arise. Remember, this should also play a significant role in which art you choose to participate in. 
Conclusion As people, we have found the need to either protect ourselves or others. This in turn has spawned the birth of numerous styles of fighting. The values and reasons passed in each of these methods vary as widely as how the style originated. 

The common factor though still remains. A well trained person in any martial art will tend to display a great deal of confidence in their life. In addition, they learn the importance of keeping your body healthy and methods on keeping it in top condition. 

Martial art is not only fun and enjoyable but it is a great way to strengthen yourself and allows you to learn how to physically defend yourself. Workout involved in training provides a boost to your flexibility, stamina, strength and art of living. The best about it is that it not only provides you with fighting art but it enables you to learn moral values. No matter what is your age martial arts ensures to make your routine life much easier. 

Many times martial arts will provide a focus for those who need it. These arts often have a morale component to teach responsibility or discovery of oneself. This of course is only a generalization and does not encapsulate every martial art. This is why you should always do your research on the art form that interests you. It is important that you find the form that not only fits you but you it.",
Airplane Combat,"Airplane Combat Information  Introduction Are you a gamer who wants to take on your game to the next level? Do you particularly love air combat games in your gaming console? Do you want to actually experience how to fight in the air? 

If your answer is yes to all of these three questions, then this article is for you. 

Air Combat Adventures is one of the newest and coolest activity hobbies in the world. In this hobby, you get to pilot an actual air fighting plane and play with your friends in the air. You don’t have to have a flying experience before or don’t have a pilot license to be able to play this one. It is fun filled and very entertaining, an experience worth remembering for years to come. You never have to worry about anything else when you are doing this because you are safe because you have a pilot and an instructor. 

Many people who are adventurous are taking this up in a big way. Just imagine you can do things by yourself that you have only watched on movies. This will be an amazing experience and one that you should not miss for the whole world! 
Equipment The usual equipment will be a full flying suit and a helmet. The flying suit makes you feel like you’re a real pilot, while the helmet serve to protect your head at all times. You will look like a fighter pilot when you don all the equipment and get on the plane! If you ever wanted to be a pilot, but missed out on the chance, then this is the time for you to get back on track. Though you may not be really fighting with the fighter, it is as close as it can ever get. 
Aircraft There are several aircrafts being used in doing this activity. Normally, the provider will specify the aircraft that will be used. Each aircraft will have some unique features. Some of the companies that have this activity have a range of aircraft, while some others may not have all the different kinds of aircraft, but you have to make do with what they have. Most of the aircraft that are used in this activity are those that have done war duty or at least those that resemble them very closely. It is an exhilarating experience for you to be able to become a fighter pilot and start shooting and doing aerobatic activities! 
How it Works Upon going to the site, you and your group will be meeting your instructor and the whole crew who are managing the site. After the meeting, you will don your flight suit, review all flight equipment, and study cockpit safety. When it’s done, there will be a flight briefing where you’ll study aerial combat concepts, skills, and tactics. After studying them, it’s time for the actual flight. All preflight safety checks will be done to ensure that no one will be harmed while doing this. Along with you will be a certified pilot instructor who will guide you throughout the course. While airborne, you’ll fly in close formation with your competitors at speeds reaching 250mph, carrying a weapon system run through and “warm-up” manoeuvres to familiarize yourself with the aircraft. When everything’s fine, the action begins. 

A one-on-one battle against your opponent begins, with multiple engagements. The aircraft has dual controls; you fly the aircraft under the guidance of the Fighter Combat instructor. 

Back at the squadron, the instructor will then re-create the mission for you and your competitors, using the multiple-view cockpit video, and the combat results, complete with what tactics you have learned that can be applied during the next mission. 
Where to Learn
Air Combat USA In this type, the adventure will put you at the controls of a Marchetti SF-260, a high-powered military trainer from Italy.

There are certain rules pertaining to altitudes and also distances that need to be maintained between the aircrafts while doing manoeuvres. The training techniques that it has will put you at ease at the controls and give you the confidence to execute even the most complex air combat manoeuvres for an amazing flying adventure. 

2. Is there a chance of me suffering from motion sickness while in air combat? Only about 10% of the pilots ever suffer due to motion sickness. This low rate is attributed to the fact that the guest pilot is in control of the aircraft. He/she is far less likely to become ill while in control than as a passenger. Also, the guest pilot will be taught to focus on the opponent at all times; not the horizon. This will not only ensure that the guest pilot will get the kill, but also will cause it to become the reference point. In spite of this, it is the experience that matters. In case of any discomfort, the flight instructor should be informed immediately. He will try to make this experience of flying into an unique one that you enjoy to the maximum..

This will make you to be able to walk with an achievement giving you a sense of accomplishment. 

6. Can I request a specific pilot from your pilot instructors? You can request a pilot from any of the instructors sent on a given deployment. Usually there are 3 - 4 pilot instructors assigned to a location. You are welcome to choose any one of them. 

7. How many hours does a session require? Expect to be with the activity site 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Upon arrival, you will suit up in a flight suit and attend a ground school / training on how to do air combat adventures. You will learn safety procedures, tactics and manoeuvres, rules of engagement and the physiological effects of g-force. Then you`ll grab a parachute and a helmet, head out to the aircraft, once inside the aircraft, you can start going to your mission alog with your instructor who will help you out if you have any problems during the combat mission. It depends on the provider if they will record your experience or not. Some offer this one and give this to you after the activity (during post-briefing). 

8. What can I read to prepare for what I will be doing with an air combat adventure? There are many references and guides that you can use for a fighter combat manoeuvre. The best one though is the one named as ‘Fighter Combat Tactics and Maneuvering’. This was written by Robert L. Shaw. It is published by Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD.",
Archery,"Archery InformationINTRODUCTIONArchery is the art, practice, or skill of propelling arrows with the use of a bow. Archery has normally been used for hunting and combat; in these modern times, its main use is that of a recreational activity.With the advent of firearms, archery has become all but obsolete in certain practices. Even the most devoted of archery-powered armies gave way to the accuracy and mobility of hand guns and rifles. Armies were brought up to speed more quickly because troops didn’t need to work on developing the special musculature required for accuracy, and firearms were much easier to maneuver when shot from behind barriers.TRADITIONPossibly because of the bow and arrow’s use in the myths of cultural gods, or perhaps from the strong desire to bring popular medieval legends to life (such as Robin Hood), the tradition of archery is far from dead. It is still very alive as a sport and as a method of hunting. The craftsmanship involved in producing a good bow and the physical challenge of an accurate aim and release has continued to be an honored tradition. In England in the late eighteenth century, Sir Walter Scott helped establish archery as a pastime of the gentry, with all the costumes and glamour that is implied with any sport of the well to do. Women were included in the activities and were even allowed to dress as the men at these events.TYPES OF BOWSThere are three main types of bows; the longbow, the recurve, and the compound bow. And though all three utilize the same basic mechanics (they use a flexible string which is attached to a brace for holding stored energy), they can be divided down even further into 1) bows which release an arrows upon pulling back on the string, itself, or 2) bows which release an arrow when a mechanism releases the string, as with the compound bow.ARROWS AND FLETCHINGThe pointed end of the projectile, of course is called the “head” of the arrow. Originally carved from stone or from the shaft itself, it is the part designed for penetrating the target, game, or enemy. The arrowheads are attached to the shaft of the arrow to serve as a projectile. Similar points can be attached to spears and launched from atlatls. The process of attaching an arrowhead to a shaft or spear is called “hafting.” This usually involves creating (or knapping or grinding) a sort of flange at the end opposite the head or point, and then the flange is hafted into a slit in the shaft and bound on with sinew or similar cord. Before their extinction about 24,000 years ago, the Neanderthals developed the extensive use of hafted stone tools. Archaeological investigation provides little evidence of the use of antler or bone. The Cro-Magnon hafted antler points onto spears between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago. The Clovis culture is noted for its use of hafted spears in the Americas around 11,000 years ago. Stone Clovis points were formed in a way that may have allowed them to break off on impact with a target. Hafted tools thought to have been created by Homo Floresiensis up to 90,000 years ago have been discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores.Arrowheads are usually separated by function:
• Bodkin points are short, rigid points with a small cross-section. They were made of unhardened iron and may have been used for better or longer flight, or for cheaper production. It has been mistakenly suggested that the bodkin came into its own as a means of penetrating armor, but research has found no hardened bodkin points, so it is likely that it was first designed either to extend range or as a cheaper and simpler alternative to the broad head. In a modern test, a direct hit from a hard steel bodkin point penetrated Damascus chain armor. However, archery was not effective against plate armor, which became available to knights of fairly modest means by the late 1300s.
• Blunts are unsharpened arrowheads occasionally used for types of target shooting, for shooting at stumps or other targets of opportunity, or hunting small game when the goal is to stun the target without penetration. Blunts are commonly made of metal or hard rubber. They may stun, and occasionally, the arrow shaft may penetrate the head and the target; safety is still important with blunt arrows.
• Judo points have spring wires extending sideways from the tip. These catch on grass and debris to prevent the arrow from being lost in the vegetation. Used for practice and for small game.
• Broad heads were used for war and are still used for hunting. Medieval broad heads could be made from steel, sometimes with hardened edges. They usually have two to four sharp blades that cause massive bleeding in the victim. Their function is to deliver a wide cutting edge so as to kill as quickly as possible. They are expensive, damage most targets, and are usually not used for practice. There are two main types of broad heads used by hunters: The fixed-blade and the mechanical types. While the fixed-blade broad head keeps its blades rigid and unmovable on the broad head at all times, the mechanical broad head deploys its blades upon contact with the target, its blades swinging out to wound the target. The mechanical head flies better because it is more streamlined, but has less penetration as it uses some of the kinetic energy in the arrow to deploy its blades.
• Target points are bullet-shaped with a sharp point, designed to penetrate target butts easily without causing excessive damage to them.
• Field tips are similar to target points and have a distinct shoulder, so that missed outdoor shots do not become as stuck in obstacles such as tree stumps. They are also used for shooting practice by hunters, by offering similar flight characteristics and weights as broad heads, without getting lodged in target materials and causing excessive damage upon removal.
• Safety arrows are designed to be used in various forms of reenactment combat, to reduce the risk when shot at people. These arrows may have heads that are very wide or padded. In combination with bows of restricted draw weight and draw length, these heads may reduce to acceptable levels the risks of shooting arrows at suitably armored people. The parameters will vary depending on the specific rules being used and on the levels of risk felt acceptable to the participants. For instance, SCA combat rules require a padded head at least 1 1/4"" in diameter, with bows not exceeding 28 inches and 50 lb. of draw for use against well-armored individuals.Fletching was designed to stabilize the flight of an arrow by providing air resistance. Fletching is usually made of strips of feather (each strip of feather or modern facsimile is called a “fletch”). Traditionally, three strips of fletching are carefully strapped or glued at the end of an arrow shaft, opposite the tip. By using even distances between the fletching, the archer can achieve a more consistent draw and reliable aim at the target. If the fletches are attached in a slight spiral arrangement, the arrow will spin somewhat in its path to the target.Archers who choose the traditional means for making their own arrows take much pride in their work—not only in choosing the proper length for their arrows (this is determined by the length and pull of the bow), but also in the color patterns, means of attachment, and precision with which the fletching is affixed.THE ART OF GOOD AIMHere are some excerpts taken from an article called “Practice or Cry” by Ted Nugent:Believe it when they say, it’s 99% mental. Be it known that there are many archers and marksmen far superior to your humble guitar player out there, and we can all learn much from these dead-eye, precision shooters… The best shots all have one thing in common; they look and shoot smoothly and comfortably, with a fluidity derived from many, many hours at the range. Simply stated, they are obviously one with their bows. Their every move is confident, graceful and sure, their weapon a natural extension of their very being… Conversely, the bad shots also have certain traits and movements in common that can best be described as awkward and uncertain.The description of the natural oneness with the bow cannot be overemphasized. If you find yourself squirming to get your arrow on the nock or the bow orientation at exactly the right angle for distance, you will most likely have already lost your best chances at a good result. Your muscles will already be under the prolonged stress of the aim, thus becoming more unstable for the draw. Here are some good, basic pointers for beginning shooters. But remember, this is only a step by step description of what should be a fluid process.1) Your body should be perpendicular to the target, and your feet should be placed shoulder’s width apart. Though you may find a personalized stance at a later time, begin with this position. The leg furthest from the shooting line will be a half to a whole foot-length in front of the other, on the ground.2) To load, point your bow toward the ground and place the shaft of the arrow on the arrow rest, which is attached in the bow “window.” The back of the arrow is attached to the bowstring with the `nock` (a small plastic component which is typified by a `v` groove for this purpose). This is called nocking the arrow. Often bow strings have a nocking guide, which will help you to consistently place the arrow at a consistent height. As mentioned above, most typical arrows have three fletches, so orient the arrow so that the prominent fletch (often a different color) is faced away from the bow as it is set into the nock.3) Hold the bowstring and arrow with three fingers. Your index finger should be placed above the arrow, with the other two fingers below it. The bow string should be placed in between the first or second joint of the fingers.4) Raise and draw the arrow to the bow. This usually done in one fluid motion. Draw the string hand toward the face, where it should rest comfortably at an anchor point somewhere between the corner of the mouth or on the chin. The bow arm is held straight and outward, toward the target. The elbow of this arm should be rotated so that the inner elbow is perpendicular to the ground (especially important if you have a hyper-extendable elbow). This position should help prevent you from getting stung by the string as it releases the arrow.5) If you are standing correctly, your body will form a “T.” Pull the arrow to the correct draw length (again, to your anchor point). Your anchor and your nocking should always be consistent. If you are adjusting for distance or height, that is done with your aim. At a full draw, the arrow should be sticking out one or two inches past the front of the bow. If it differs substantially, you should be fitted for a different length arrow or new bow.6) Releasing the arrow is done by simply relaxing the fingers of the drawing hand. By doing this, the drawing arm will remain rigid and, and its muscles will not relax until after the arrow has already hit its destination.PLACES TO SHOOTWhether you want to pursue your hobby on a practical basis (such as for hunting), competitively, or to honor the past through historical re-enactments and tournaments, there are many opportunities available for you to try. A good place to start would be to find nearby practice centers (either indoor or outdoor), and meet the people who use those places and post events on the bulletin boards. Get on their mailing lists. Learning from seasoned archers can be truly rewarding, just as the tradition has always been. You may find they are not using the same type of bow you are using, but much of their technique is valid and transferable, if you are willing to apply it. If hunting with a compound bow is your goal, read the magazines, use the internet, or ask to go along on hunting trips (if anything, offering to haul a deer to the truck can be a very kind gesture!). If you’re looking to improve your technique on a re-curve, try to attend events and competitions (and of course practice) whenever you can. To practice with the Society for Creative Anachronism, you will need to sign a waiver, but you’re not obligated to join the organization. These groups usually practice on a weekly basis at designated spots, and there are many imaginative events you can attend that use various targets and techniques, including crossbow challenges.In addition to bow hunting and target archery, there is field archery, 3-D archery, Olympic archery, Clout archery (in the United Kingdom), field crossbow archery, flight archery, ski archery, horse archery, and several others. Visit the FITA (International Archery Federation) or the USA Archery website to help you pick a direction and get your new hobby off to a good start.",
Base Jumping,"Base Jumping Information  Introduction When it comes to the intense and electrifying recreation of parachuting, it isn’t always possible to find a plane, or the money to rent a plane, that will bring you up to the right altitude and let you jump from it. The free-fall from such heights can be described as exhilarating, spiritual, and rejuvenating, but sometimes people want a more immediate thrill, and sometimes something with just a little more risk. 

This is where base jumping comes into play. The idea of free-falling from an airplane appears to have, somewhere along the way, lost its appeal to the more die-hard adrenaline junkies, and base jumping came into being. 

Base jumping is a recreational activity where a person straps a parachute to his or her back, just as though they were going to skydive, and instead leaps from a tall structure, or cliff, for example. There are practically no limits any longer to what base jumpers will leap from, but the most popular choices remain bridges, buildings, antennae arrays, and cliffs. 

Base jumping offers plenty of exhilaration and adrenaline-inducing excitement, and it also comes with risks that are both common to skydiving, and others that are unique to base jumping itself. Whenever a person leaps into the air and falls hundreds or even thousands of feet to the ground below, there are a number of things that can go wrong. Fortunately, parachutes have residual backup chutes in case the primary fails for some reason. In base jumping, there is significantly less time to make corrections in the event of a catastrophic failure. 

Also, wind currents that are common around major structures, such as buildings and bridges, can pose some risks to the base jumper, by threatening to push him or her toward the structure, rather than away from it. It is akin to swimming in the ocean near a rocky ledge. The currents can drive even the strongest and most experience swimmer into the rocks, causing serious injury or death. 

For base jumpers, part of the thrill is in the risk, but there are many things that experienced base jumpers do before a jump that helps to minimize the risk to themselves and others. For those looking for a thrill and relatively easy access to many base jumping points, base jumping offers a quick thrill and a lifetime of memories that one can share with his or her loved ones and friends. 

Beginning to learn how to base jump requires some special instruction from experience skydiving and base jumping professionals. There is a technique to guiding oneself to the ground as well as in the actual landing. Base jumping isn’t for the timid or faint of heart, but is more geared toward those thrill seekers who seem unable to get enough excitement. 
Hazards and Dangers As one can imagine, there are many hazards and dangers that are inherent to base jumping. Wind is a difficult factor to predict, especially when presented around major objects and obstacles, such as buildings, bridges, and around cliffs. Even when wind appears to move in one steady direction from the top of the structure one wishes to jump from, it can be completely different along the path down to the ground. 

Several people have died throughout the years from base jumping and many of them have suffered their fate due to a lack of preparation, being in a rush, and basically not taking into full account the factor of the wind direction. When jumping from a tall building, for example, one could find themselves being pushed into and slammed against the building before they have a chance to open their chute. This can also occur after the chute is opened, causing the lines to tangle. 

Another common hazard are cable lines or electrical lines. This is especially true of jumping from antennae arrays. Cables that support these tall structures can extend out several hundred feet and while they may not seem to pose much of a threat to the base jumper initially, if the wind drives the base jumper slightly off course, then the cables can become a major factor in their safe landing.  
Other Dangers Of course, the dangers that base jumping pose is not limited to merely physical ones. There are many legal issue to consider when planning or attempting a base jump. Most base jumping activities, at least in major cities, is considered illegal and the result can be arrest, prosecution, possible fines and jail time. 
Equipment Needed for Base Jumping There isn’t a great deal needed for base jumping, but experience is perhaps the most important piece of ‘equipment’ that anyone should possess, long before he or she ever attempts a base jump in the first place. Watching experienced base jumpers makes the sport, or activity, seem simple. It is not. 

Aside from the obvious, a parachute especially designed for base jumping (meaning, designed for low altitude jumps), there are many smaller pieces of equipment that could come in handy, especially for evaluation purposes. 

Special wind monitoring equipment is one of the most crucial for successful jumps. By carefully gauging the wind, direction, and currents that the wind follows in and around the target jumping platform, an experienced base jumper can determine his or her jump time and path, or whether the jump should even be attempted. 

Climbers who seek to successfully summit Mount Everest perform a number of weather readings and tests to gauge whether or not the time is right to make an assault on the summit. No experience climber would ever blindly walk into the unknown when the slightest miscalculation can cost him or her, or one of the people to whom they are charged with safety, is at stake. Base jumping is no different, though far too many inexperienced base jumpers simply climb to the peak of their jump site and take their chances. 

Many times, these jumps are successful, but every so often, a base jump ends in tragedy when it didn’t have to. 
What Does It Take to Learn to Base Jump? Unfortunately, for the avid enthusiast who wishes to head out today and learn to base jump, the entire sport or activity requires many years of experience. Most base jumpers have a history of skydiving, having logged in hundreds of successful jumps from airplanes before they take on their first base jump. The reason for this is that in base jumping, there is far less time to make adjustments to changing or unexpected conditions than there is in skydiving. 

While skydiving, a person free falls for anywhere from one to three minutes. Some dives begin at an altitude of 15,000 (fifteen thousand) feet. Base jumping can originate from an altitude as low as 300 feet, though this is highly discouraged due to the extreme lack of time to make corrections should something go wrong. 

Some base jumpers deploy their chute as soon as their feet leave the solid surface or platform while others prefer to experience the free fall for a few seconds before deploying the chute. 
How to Start the Base Jumping Experience The first thing that anyone should do if he or she is interested in diving into the world of base jumping is to contact a local skydiving professional to begin their lessons. Most skydiving centers do not require the individual to own any necessary equipment of their own as they provide it for their clients. 

If you have never jumped from a perfectly safe airplane while cruising along at a high altitude, then you may want to consider a tandem skydive jump first, to gauge whether this is an activity that you truly want to take part in. Tandem jumps require only minimal training in landing, but solo skydiving jumps will require training in pulling the ripcord on the chute, how to manage the backup chute should something go wrong with the primary one, how to maneuver the parachute once open to guide yourself to the proper landing point, and how to successfully land without injury. 

Once you perform a solo dive, you will realize just how much there is to learn and how much practice it takes to successfully jump from an airplane. The factors that make skydiving such a wonderful experience and a great way to learn –being in the open with plenty of room to maneuver, for example- is completely the opposite of base jumping. 

In skydiving, you have many seconds, even minutes, to absorb the surroundings, a wide open expanse of space in which to make mistakes in the turning of the chute, and usually an open field or waterway in which to land. Even if you’re off the mark by several hundred feet, you are generally safe. Also, in skydiving, under the direction of experienced professional skydivers, you are not placed in any hazardous situation, such as trees or power lines. 

In base jumping, there is no room for error and any mistake can be fatal. Most skydiving instructors will discourage the act of base jumping, not only for the issues of safety that have been presented here, but also for the legal aspects. Due to its dangers, most states and countries have laws that prohibit base jumping. But learning to skydive and doing enough dives to master the art from beginning to end is the best way to have success and fun base jumping. 
Where to Jump If you are looking for places to jump, the best way to find the ideal locations is to locate other base jumpers throughout your region, or country. There are usually many forums on which people post their jumps and discuss the sport. You will likely find many base jumpers who are willing to help you take your first steps into this adrenaline rush of a sport, though they will make sure that you have considerable experience skydiving first. 
Frequently Asked Questions Why base jump in the first place? People who have never performed a base jump and only hear about the dangers, usually after a fatality is reported in the news, wonder what the excitement is all about. For the most part, it’s about the speed and the thrill of leaping from heights and having only moments to safely navigate one’s way to the ground below. It can be compared to the thrill that some people get when they speed down a narrow road in a sports car. Putting other people at risk, however, should be the last thing anyone should do when base jumping. 

I’m afraid of heights. Is base jumping for me? The answer to this question is simple. It depends. Some people who are afraid of heights have gone skydiving and loved it, and ultimately led to base jumping. Others simply can never overcome their inherent fears. The only way to know is to try a tandem skydive jump and find out if that’s something for you. 
Conclusion While base jumping is illegal in many locations, it’s important to note that this site does not condone any illegal activities in any way, shape, or form. For locations in which base jumping is legal, it is such an intense and dangerous activity that one should seriously partake in a number of solo skydives before ever attempting a base jump.",
Ice Skating,"Ice Skating Information  Introduction Ice skating is the skill of moving over the ice using ice skates. Ice skating is done on ice rink. An ice rink is a frozen body of water where people can skate or play winter sports. Skates, typically, have single blades. Ice skating is considered to be a tremendous sport and recreational activity with no age group restriction. It has been seen that large group of people has false approach regarding this sport. They consider it to be a dangerous sport but by paying a little attention one can be a master of ice skating. 

A trained, professional skater have a firm grip over ice skating and can perform various complex moves on ice whereas a beginner skater is most likely to fall flat on ice more often than doing skating. 

Ice skating can be done for many reasons. It can be for leisure purpose, sports, or even travelling. Ice skating can be of different types such as figure skating, ice hockey or speed skating, Rousette skating and Synchronized skating which are all part of Olympic sports. Ice skating can be done on artificially prepared ice tracks or on naturally occurring frozen bodies such as a frozen river or water. The artificial tracks can be indoor as well as outdoor. 
Ice Skates Having most popular entertainment sports games like ice hockey , ice dancing and figure skating, ice skating has earn immense popularity all around like a wild jungle fire. Ice skates are the most basic equipment needed for doing ice skating. 

What is an ice skate? They are boots having sharp blades connected to its bottom that helps a person to propel on an ice surface. Bottom of an ice skate contains a hollow crescent design two immense sharp edges. Radius or dept of hollow is of numerous sizes depending upon the following elements: 

1- Weight of skater 2- Strength of skater 3- Ability of skater 4- Style of sport 5- Nature of sport (type of skating). 

Skates like touring skates and speed skate don’t have bottom which is hollow, that enables the person to make a smooth slide but they are unable to cut ice with ease. 

Following are the few types of ice skates: 

1- Figure skate 2- Recreational ice skates 3- Speed skates or racing skates 4- Hockey skates 5- Bandy Skates 
Types of Ice Skating There are numerous types of ice skating that includes Ice Figure Skating, Ice Speed Skating, Tour Ice Skating and Ice Hockey. Skating is a professional sport as well as hobby that have need of expertise to become an expert and to slide with ease on ice sheet. 

People having passion and love for this sport are mainly seen participating in the following two categories: 

a- Figure skating b- Hockey skating  
Tour Skating Tour Skating is a sport and recreational form of long distance ice skating on natural ice.  
Speed Skating Speed Skating or speedskating is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in traveling a certain distance on skates.  
Figure skating Is a sport (Olympic ) that involves an individual, set of performers or even a pair who perform various moves of spinning, foot , jumping and couple of other attractive and challenging stunts on sheet of ice. There are number of levels ranging from beginner level till Olympic level. It also involves variety of competitions at international, national and local scale. All competitions and judging of figure skating on international scale is done by ISU (international Skating Union). Moreover it is a must event of Olympic Games conducted in winters. 

Following are the major international competitions that are authorized by international skating union: 

1- ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating. 2- European Figure Skating Championships. 3- World Championships. 4- Winter Olympic Games. 5- World Junior Figure Skating Championships. 6- Four Continents Figure Skating Championships. 

Figure skating falls in four main branches i.e. Synchronized Skating, Ice Dance, pair skating and individual or single skating. 

Synchronized Skating: A group of 12 to 20 skaters are involved in performing synchronized skating. These skaters then perform various techniques all together with music playing in the background. The basic formations include wheels, blocks, lines, circles, and intersections. The close formations and need for the team to stay in unison add to the difficulty of the footwork performed by the skaters in these elements 

Ice Dancing: Ice Dancing is just like doing ballroom dancing. In this skaters are allowed or can skate foxtrots, tangos, waltzes or any type of dance they want to. These dances can be performed individually or with a partner. Make sure while performing not to lift your partner above your shoulder. Ice dance differs from pairs in focusing on intricate footwork performed in close dance holds, in time with the music. 

Pair Skating: It is a type of free skating in which two skaters, i.e. lady and a man, girl or a boy skates, and performs number of foot works, spins and jumps. Pairs perform singles elements in unison as well as pair-specific elements such as throw jumps, in which the man `throws` the woman into a jump; lifts, in which the woman is held above the man`s head in one of various grips and positions; pair spins, in which both skaters spin together about a common axis; death spirals; and other elements. They lift and spins each other to make their performance more attractive and touching. 

Single Skatin: The most well know form of figure skating is known as single skating in which an individual performs. The workout he or she performs could be anything i.e. spinning, jumping or mixture set of various moves. 
Hockey skating Hockey skating is way more forceful, speedy as compared to figure skating. The speed in hockey skating depends upon two key elements that includes Foot speed and Skating power (skills). Hockey skating may involve many injuries so make sure while playing it you wear helmet as if your head strike the ice you won’t get hurt. Wear proper gloves as if while playing you fall down and other player by mistake step on your hand your figure won’t get damage from the sharp blades. 
Effective Ways to Learn Ice Skating: 1. Look for suitable skates: Make sure the skate you buy ideally fit you as it is very much necessary to comfort your feet. Keep that in mind that while purchasing skate you check both the shoe by wearing them. Difference in the size of both feet can create problem while skating so if you check the size by wearing them at the time of purchasing it will make you clear to buy this or not. So select that shoe that ideally fits to both feet and you feel easy in them. There are various expensive brands available but if you are a beginner, it is advisable to go for rental skate shoes. 

2. Try to walk: Skating rinks mostly have rubber matting for you to walk on. You should walk around on this matting in order to learn to keep the centre of gravity maintained. Make sure that you have your skate guards on. 

3. Try to get and move on ice: Initially, you should get familiar with the ice and how it feels by holding the wall and walking around rink’s edges. You need to keep yourself relaxed and should know good techniques if you want to skate well. By walking around you will be able to learn to support your ankle as well as get used to the ice friction. 

Initially, you should get familiar with the ice and how it feels by holding the wall and walking around rink’s edges. You need to keep yourself relaxed and should know good techniques if you want to skate well. By walking around you will be able to learn to support your ankle as well as get used to the ice friction. 

4. Become skilled at keeping or sustaining your balance: In order to learn how to balance, grasp both of your arms at a level below to your shoulders. After this, lean the knees and bend forward. It will be very good if you do this without any support. If you are facing problem in maintaining balance without any support, use walls as a support. 

5. Do crouch: You should stand straight up with your feet kept at hip distance apart. Your arms should be in front of you. After this, with slight squat find the centre of balance. Keep on repeating till you are comfortable. After this, you should squat down a little further until your knees start bending. All this time make sure you are looking forward. 

6. Falling during practice: It is obvious while practicing, you will fall several times. Make sure you get succeed in pulling your arms out resulting in a safer fall else it can lead to many injuries including knee, wrist and many more. 

7. How to stand up: If you fall, make sure while you are getting up to stand put your knees and hands on to surface. Put one foot in between the hands. Do the same with the other foot. It will make you to stand with much ease and perfection. 

8. Move toward forward: Make you weak foot to bend, then with the help of other feet make a push outwards that direction diagonals. This will make you to move forward. After you achieve succeed, perform the same move with your other foot so that you can be able to move with the help of both feet. 

9. Along with big strokes try also to glide: While doing stroking make sure you give an extra push or pressure to your ankle or toe this will boost your speed and with make you quicker. Try to lean the knees as much as possible and with the strokes move your body. 

10. Learn to stop: For stopping, one skate should be placed behind you with toe facing away. Now, drag it gently behind till you reach a complete halt. Doing this will put all your balance on one foot only so make sure that you do a lot of one foot skating practice in order to master this technique. 
Tips 1. Never look down to the surface while you are skating. If you do so your concentration will be distracted and you can collide with the corner wall of the ice ground. 

2. If you are a beginner get old or rental skates, if you are a master in it you can buy various expensive skates. 

3. Tie the skates in a proper way. Otherwise a perfect skate can’t help you to make it done with perfection. 

4. Make sure while practicing it, you warm up your body to avoid injuries. 

5. Have some training classes in order to learn. 

6. Never bend on you back if you are a beginner, it will result in sever back injuries. 

7. Never stop practicing as there is no end to perfection. 
FAQ: What do I need in order to Skate? To skate you will need to have a proper pair of ice skates and some warm clothing. If you have these two you are good to go. If you are a beginner it is recommended that you rent a pair of skates instead of purchasing new one because with time, training and experience ice skating needs will change and you will eventually need to buy a new but a different type of pair. 

What is the proper clothing needed for ice skating? Clothing depends upon where you plan to skate. If you are to skate indoors, then typically the temperature will be around 50 to 60 degrees but if you are to skate outdoor than keep in mind that temperature will be colder. Make sure to wear layers. The clothing should be comfortable and you should be able to move easily. Do wear gloves as well but not thick or heavy socks as they become a problem. Also, if you are a beginner make sure to wear a helmet. 

I am a beginner, should I prefer hockey skates or figure skates? For a beginner, it doesn’t matter which skates you wear. You can learn the basics of skating on any of the skates. 

What should I keep in mind when purchasing skates? Make sure that your skates fit properly. No room should be there for extra boots. When you were skates, make sure that the toes are able to wiggle. Also, once you have tied the laces the heel should not be able to slide down or up. Finally, make sure that the maximum support is at the ankle. 
Conclusion: Ice skating can be a lot fun to do. Once you have learned and become an expert in ice skating, you will then know how much exciting as well as relaxing this game is. Once you start skating you will not be able to stop yourself. You will want to skate all day on the ice, not necessarily doing some special moves but simply gliding on ice. 

Ice skating has a got a lot of variety and techniques which one can learn. In order to learn, one may need a help of a professional. After having received proper training, you will need to practice a lot in order to master a technique and be able to do it comfortably. You can then even go out and compete or simply do it as a recreational activity.",
Sailing,"Sailing Information  Introduction There are only a handful of places in the world that still use sailboats for non-recreational use. This is due to the advancement of technology. Even poor places in the world can get a hold of a motor that will be more reliable than the wind. 

Many sailing vessels will be relatively small crafts that will often have a motor as a backup means for transportation. The hobby involves trapping wind to maneuver a ship across a body of water. 

The average sail boat will be found on large bodies of water. This includes but not limited to a sea, a lake, or ocean. Rivers are not normally sailed due to the speed at which the water moves. Adding wind power is unnecessary. 
Brief History Throughout history sailing has been instrumental in the development of civilization, affording mankind greater mobility and capacity for fishing, trade, and warfare. The earliest representation of a ship under sail appears on a painted disc found in Kuwait dating to the late 5th millennium BC. Advances in sailing technology from the Middle Ages onward enabled Arab, Chinese, Indian and European explorers to make longer voyages into regions with extreme weather and climatic conditions. There were improvements in sails, masts and rigging; navigation equipment improved. From the 15th century onwards, European ships went further north, stayed longer on the Grand Banks and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and eventually began to explore the Pacific Northwest and the Western Arctic. Sailing has contributed to many great explorations in the world. 
Directions on a boat Specific terminology is used when navigating a boat whether you’re steering it or walking around inside it. The terminology is used in nearly every part of the world. This gives a common language for sailor to use to relate to any ship no matter its make or model. 

Fore 

When heading to the bow/front of the boat you are heading fore. The way you are facing has no bearing on which way fore is. 

Aft 

Aft is the back of the boat. This is also referred to as the stern. When you head towards the stern or if things are located near the back they are aft. This also refers to locations inside and outside the boat. So if something is behind the ship, it is also located aft. 

Starboard 

If you are standing in a boat and facing towards the bow, starboard is to your right. A good way to remember this is the word starboard is longer than the word port, which is the opposite direction. Likewise, the word right is bigger than the word left. Therefore, starboard is the same as right. 

Port 

Port is the left side of the ship. By left this means, if you are standing in a boat facing the front port is on your left side. You can use the same memory device presented in starboard to keep the two directions separated. 
Parts of a Sailboat If you were to dissect a sailboat into its most basic parts, you will end up with three major categories of parts. These parts are the sails, the rigging, and the hull. Each of these areas is comprised of a number of separate parts. 

Knowing the names of all these parts is usually the first step you take when attempting to take on this hobby. An experienced sailor who can teach you to sail will drill terms like this into you first. If you don’t learn these terms it may be impossible to teach you.  
Sails The main thing that makes a sailboat what it is is the sail. This consists of a large strong fabric. The sail is what captures and transfers the force of the wind into forward motion on a boat. Many sailboats will use a variety of sails to accomplish this. 

The mainsail is the largest sail on your boat. It is the focal point of all the force transference on the boat. It is responsible for moving the ship. 

The other sails job is to direct wind into the mainsail. To accomplish this it is important to learn what portions of these sails need to be moved into place. The following terms and descriptions will identify these portions of sails and/or their location. 

The head is the top corner of a triangular sail. Every triangular sail has one. It will end in a point. This is not to be confused with a headsail. 

A headsail refers to an entire sail. The term only signifies that this particular sail is positioned in front of the mast. 

A jib is an example of a headsail. It is triangular in shape and placed in front of the mast. The next two terms luff and leech refer to the two side edges of a sail. The luff is the edge is the leading edge of the sail. This means it is the edge that is closest to the front of the boat. The leech is the opposite of this. It is the back or trailing edge of a sail. It is closer to the stern. 

The front and back corners of a sail also have specific names. The tack and clew refer to these corners. The tack is the corner that is closer to the front of the ship. The clew is the back most corner of a sail. This allows for very precise directions to be given about a sail. 

The final part of the sail is the bottom most edge. This is called the foot of a sail. Now you can take all these elements and put them together. 

On a jib, the head is where the luff and leech meet. The tack is where the luff meets the foot of the sail. This leaves the clew the point at which the leech meets the foot.  
Rigging The rigging includes all the parts that support the sails on the boat. They are the middle ground between the hull and the sails. The rigging will be the most used portion of a sailboat since it is the objects you’ll need to maneuver to make the ship function. 

The following terms are general in nature. Many different sailing vessels will use a variety of other rigging setups. These are the most commonly used parts found on nearly every sailboat. 

The mast is the tall structure that you sails are mounted to. It is often found in a central location on your boat. 

To support the mast wire lines are needed. These lines that work the mast are called the standing rigging. Since there are multiple lines with different functions it’s best to break this section down even further. 

The two main types of rigging that provide stability to the mast is the stay and the shroud lines. The stay is often connected to the top of the mast. It is then secured to a place fore and aft of the ship. The shroud lines give additional support to the lateral stability of the mast. The other lines that are used have more to do with controlling the boat. These other lines are generically called running rigging. 

There are two specific terms for running rigging that are used and are crucial to know. The sheet is a line that controls a specific sail. Some sails may have multiple sheets attached. The halyard is the specific line that raises and lowers a sail in place. 

Other import structures in the rigging include the boom. The boom is a structure that is connected to the foot of a sail. This not only spreads the sail, but gives the sailor an easy way to maneuver the sail in wide turns. 

Another interesting piece is the spreader. A spreader is typically a bar that holds the shroud line away from the mast. This prevents the shroud line from getting in the way of the sailor and the sails. Now that we have a general coverage of rigging we can move on to the ship’s hull.  
Hull To give ship functionality, it needs a body. This is the hull. With a hull you can transport goods or people and have a platform to mount your rigging and sails. It is also the part of the ship that is responsible for floating. 

The most basic part of the ship is the bow. This is the front of any ship. It is typically designed to come to a point. This allows the boat to cut through the water thereby reducing the friction it generates. 

The back portion of the boat is the stern. Often you’ll find additional steering devices located here. A motor is often put here for times when a ship needs to maneuver in tight quarters like when pulling into a dock. 

The centerboard or keel is a structure that sticks into the water providing stability to the side motion of a boat. Since sailboats are more often longer than they are wide, the ability to knock the ship on its side is very great. The keel adds friction in the water so that the boat resists an odd cross wind from turning the boat over. For smaller boats the keel is called a dagger and is often removable. In larger ships the keel is fixed and filled with ballast. 

As with all boats a rudder is fixed to the stern of the boat. This gives the captain a way to help direct the hull of the ship. This gives the ability to make sharp turns since otherwise the ships hull would simple drag against the water. 

To operate the rudder requires a steering mechanism. Large ships will use a mechanically based system. For smaller boats a tiller can be used. These are the major portions of the hull and can give you a basis on how to relate to a ship. 
What You Need Often sailing has been equated to the rich as a hobby. However, if you have access to the right areas there will be plenty of instructors who can teach you on their own boat. 

The fee for this service will be based on an individual basis. Some of the key factors may include the type of ship you want to learn on, the location of where you want to learn, and the instructor’s personal fee. 

These boats will come equipped with life jackets and all the safety gear needed to retrieve someone from the water. Make sure that a radio is on board. Communication is key on any boat. By having a radio you can talk with other vessels to avoid a collision. 

Sailboats can be rented. However, as with most vehicles you will need to be licensed before anyone will trust you with their boat. 

When it comes to beginners make sure you are dressed appropriately. If the area you learn in is cold dress warmly. If it is hot make sure that you have sun block. Also make sure that you have plenty of drinking water. Even though you’re on a boat on water, the water typically is unhealthy to drink. 
Conclusion The hobby of sailing is a true recreational sport. The two main approaches to the sport involve either exciting competitions or pure relaxation. This is a great activity that every member of your family can participate in. 

Unfortunately, if you want to fully immerse yourself in the sport, it will be cost prohibited. You would need to purchase your own sailboat and equipment. Since safety is a big issue it is necessary that you keep lines and sails in excellent condition. If you don’t have property with a dock, you’ll have to pay a fee to store a boat at a mooring. Unlike speed boats and other motorized water vehicles, a sailboat is not typically transported over land. 

For many learning the art is satisfaction in itself. It teaches both a valuable skill and physics that are found in nature. It is also a great way to connect with and enjoy coastal landscapes that few other options offer.",
Gymnastics,"Gymnastics Information  Introduction There is no sport that involves such talent, such balance, such coordination, and such grace as gymnastics. The things performed within this sport are often hard to believe or understand how people can contort their body in such a fashion. This is not a sport that everybody can take on because it requires great stamina, flexibility, and skill. Those who perform it are quite passionate about it and get the feeling of flying through the air depending on what they perform on. This sport is often the feature of the summer Olympics because people just love to watch as the gymnasts flip through the air and handle the equipment with such amazing ease. This has been around for centuries, but the tricks and the level of difficulty continue to get more and more amazing through time. Though you may have never tried a cartwheel, you can certainly have an appreciation for these gymnasts and all that they do. This is one sport that will be around for years and continue to amaze those of us who watch. 
Different Types and Equipment The various types of gymnastics have as much to do with the equipment used as the way in which it is performed. The essence of this sport is centered around the pieces of equipment utilized in it. These are not pieces of equipment that one would just purchase for their own use. These are pieces of equipment that one would find in a gymnasium where various routines can be performed. Understanding the different types of gymnastics can come with understanding the different types of equipment. Typically men compete six events: Floor Exercise, Pommel Horse, Still Rings, Vault, Parallel Bars, and High Bar, while women compete four: Vault, Uneven Bars, Balance Beam, and Floor Exercise.

There are also lesser known types of gymnastics that are still quite popular and involve just as much skill. Though much of what we know of gymnastics comes to us from the artistic types we’ve discussed, there are also different types as well. Rhythmic gymnastics is another form that we see in the Olympics. This type is performed with a ball or ribbon or some other similar type of apparatus and it is more focused on an aesthetic appeal than the other forms. Though it is still performed, it is nowhere near as popular as the other types. 

There are also other types of gymnastics that are performed but perhaps don’t gain as much notarity as the other forms. Tumbling, trampolining, aerobic, and even acrobatic gymnastics are all types that are practiced but either aren’t part of competitions such as Olympics or don’t receive the same attention as the rest. People may train within one of these other types or learn them as part of their repertoire. Gymnastics is also involved in other sports that people may participate in such as diving or dance. You often see gymnastics incorporated into such activities, and therefore they are sort of offshoots of this beloved sport. 
How and Where to Learn This is a sport that can be dangerous so you really want to be sure that you learn it well. Many children get involved in gymnastics from an early age and perfect the sport as they get older. It’s sometimes easier to learn early on because you tend to have more flexibility in the body and are therefore less prone to injuries. There are plenty of opportunities for adults to learn as well, but it might be a bit tougher on the body than when you are young. Typically gymnastics happens in a class setting or as a private lesson. There are a variety of different places and ways that one can learn about this exciting and captivating sport. 

- Gymnastics Center: In just about every city or community there is a gymnastics center. These are facilities that are focused solely on the sport and which offer some fantastic classes to the general public. The gym is usually set up with all of the different equipment such as balance beams, uneven bars, vault, and plenty of floor space for routines to be learned. This is a great place to learn, particularly if you are just starting out. The classes can be a bit pricey sometimes, but the direction comes from trained professionals who have often performed for years within the sport. 

- Local Community Center or School: Though they are not entirely centered on gymnastics as the previous option, these can be a great way to learn about the sport. Many community centers or even schools are set up for competitions and for classes. They may offer the same equipment or perhaps a bit less than a gymnastics center, but can be great for younger children or those that want to focus on a certain aspect of gymnastics. This is great for learning the ropes and for getting involved in various niches of the sport such as balance beam for example. The classes can be a bit more affordable and are usually offered by somebody who has a certain level of experience. 

- Private Lessons: These lessons can either happen at a facility or another destination such as an instructors home if they have the right equipment and room. This is usually for an individual that is more well versed at the sport or who is training for competitions, and who is taking the learning process very seriously. There is a rather substantial financial investment in this type of learning, but it can pay off if one hopes to compete within gymnastics at some point. It’s best to research the instructor to be certain that their credentials are in line with your expectations. 

- Group Classes: These can be offered just about anywhere from a local community center to another facility that features all different types of classes. This is usually how young students start off because fundamental concepts are taught rather than focusing on certain specifics of the sport. This can be a great way to introduce the sport to somebody just starting out as it is far less intimidating than other methods of learning. 

- Practicing at Home: Whether you do this in conjunction with other types of learning or simply want to try out new tricks on your own, many people learn how to perform in gymnastics by practicing at home. They may practice certain moves like headstands in their own home or perfect cartwheels in their own backyard. It’s not wise to try anything dangerous on your own in this capacity, but it can be a great way to really work on your comprehension of the sport. 

No matter how or where you learn about gymnastics, it can be a very rewarding sport. There are a variety of ways in which an individual can learn about it and figure out which aspects are of the most interest to them. Take the time to look into options offered in your area and then decide which best fits your needs and your skill level. If you are just getting into it then you may find that certain methods such as group classes are more beneficial. If however you are training for competitions, you may find that private lessons are a must. There are so many great ways to learn the sport, you just have to find the one that best fits your needs. 
Tips and Tricks No matter what level you are at, injuries can happen at any time and they can be quite serious. The more you receive instruction and the more you practice, the better you will get. The more accurate you are in your performance, the less likely you are to get injured. There are some fundamental things to keep in mind as you approach the sport of gymnastics. These can keep you safe, free from injury, and able to perfect the skills that you are learning. 

- Take your training seriously: There is a good reason why gymnastics involves so much training. This is a sport where you are flipping, spinning, and sometimes flying through the air. Without proper instruction you can really get hurt and therefore you need to take your training quite seriously. You want to be sure that you are in good shape to best handle the moves so train for this with running and any other activities that will get you fit and ready to handle this sport. 

- Never push yourself too hard: If you feel overtired or as if you are having a bad day, then it’s best to take a break. If you work when too tired or when you just aren’t physically ready or up for it, you can get hurt. You also never want to push yourself through tricks that you aren’t ready for. Go at your own pace and know your limits as that’s an important part of this sport. 

- Try one piece of equipment at a time: Though you may become well versed within the various pieces of equipment over time, don’t start off with too much. Each type of gymnastics requires certain skills and certain understanding. Therefore you want to be sure to slowly get the instruction that you need to get yourself up and running before you move to another piece of equipment. 

- You can never practice too much: This like many other sports requires a great deal of practice. There is much to be learned here and therefore you want to take your time and practice often. The gymnasts that you see in serious competitions such as the Olympics have very stringent training schedules because this is an essential part of learning. If you take your time and practice often, you will get better faster. 

- Don’t try stunts that you aren’t ready for: As part of the idea of never pushing yourself, you should never try out any skills that you haven’t learned properly. If you haven’t yet learned a back handspring, then don’t try it on your own. If you do just one move improperly, it can result in a very serious injury. You need to recognize where you are at in the learning process and never try to jump ahead as it can really hurt you in the long run. 

- Never push through an injury: Though in some sports it can be essential to push through an injury, that is not something that you want to do in gymnastics. Pushing yourself when injured can put you out of the sport for even longer or forever in some instances. Though this may sound extreme, it can really happen and that’s why it’s crucial to nurse your injury rather than push through it. - 
Conclusion People from all over the world watch in amazement as their favorite gymnasts flip through the air. It’s mesmerizing and simply amazing that people can actually perform these tricks, and therefore we find ourselves in awe. This is a sport with great history and rich tradition, and it is what the Olympics have been centered on for centuries. There are many different types of gymnastics, all requiring special skills and learning for perfection. The equipment used in these various forms of gymnastics have as much to do with the sport as anything else. From the parallel bars in men’s gymnastics to the floor routines in women’s gymnastics, there is much to learn and work on if you are a gymnast. There is a reason that there are so many classes, so many competitions, and so many featured shows and pieces on gymnastics. It is not only a sport, but it is also an art form and it is here to stay for centuries more.",
Tequila Tasting,"Tequila Tasting Information  The Process  The actual process of tasting tequila consists of four simple steps which are otherwise known as the four S process of tasting tequila. 

Seeing – The color of the tequila will be viewed and examined against a white backdrop. The glass will have to be turned in the opposite direction. The color of the tequila should be saturated in case it belongs to the Reposado and the Anejo variety. The Blanco variety will appear as completely clear when it is examined against a white background. No deposits or sediments can be found in this form of tequila. 

Swirling – The tequila will have to be swirled in the right manner inside its glass in order to enjoy the unique and exotic fragrance or aroma of the spirit. The actual taste of tequila will be derived from these fragrances and aromas. The aroma will have to be enjoyed and understood clearly during the process of tasting tequila. 

Sipping – The first sip of the tequila should contain a sizeable amount of the spirit. The drink should cover the complete surface of the mouth of the person and it can be moved around all the parts of the mouth in a manner similar to moving mouthwash around the mouth. The feeling which is experienced on taking the first taste of the tequila will have to be understood with clarity. The taste which is experienced will sometimes be thin and acidic while a rich and smooth flavor will be experienced in certain instances. A complete feeling of warmth will engulf all parts of the mouth after it has been touched by tequila. 

Savoring – The tequila which is being sampled at the tequila tasting party will have to be moved around all the parts of the mouth in a manner which is similar to gargling the mouth with mouthwash. The mouth of every human being has four basic kinds of taste buds which include salty, bitter, sweet and acidic. Any flavor which cannot be included under these four categories will be interpreted by the brain in the form of a fragrance or aroma which will be felt by the retro nasal passage which is present at the back of your throat. The act of gargling or chewing the tequila or spirit will help in making all the volatile elements, disappear. This can prove to be beneficial in the long run. 

Evaluation - After the people who have gathered for the tequila tasting party have actually finished sampling and tasting the tequila, they will have to perform an evaluation of the tequila which has been tasted by them. The results of their evaluation can be divided into three main categories which involve the visual, the olfactory and the gustative features. 

The score for the visual aspect can be valued up to a maximum of 30 points. The person should examine the clarity and purity of the liquid. The degree or tone of the amber of the spirit will also have to be evaluated. The color will sometimes be completely clear and transparent while in some other cases it will be slightly translucent. The color of the tequila will usually depend on the amount of time which has been devoted to the process of aging of the tequila inside wooden barrels similar to those which are used for the aging of wine. The intensity and the brightness of the tequila will have to be compared to all the other kinds of tequila. 

The olfactory features will also have to be evaluated and given a maximum of 30 points. The fragrances and aromas which are received from the tequila will be the deciding factor while evaluating the olfactory features of the tequila. Well-prepared and well aged tequila will have an aroma which is the perfect combination of the fragrances of wood, flowers, fruits, spices and citric acids. A proper mixture of all these blends and fragrances will help in preparing the right kind of tequila which will have the perfect taste as well as fragrance and aroma. 

The gustative features command more importance when compared to the visual features and the olfactory features. The evaluation of these gustative features will involve a maximum of 40 points. The taste which is experienced on the tongue of the person who has tasted the tequila will be evaluated under this category. This taste is one of the most important features which have to be evaluated during the course of the tequila tasting. 

The depth or intensity of the taste will have to be experienced clearly along with the delicacy in order to provide a fair evaluation of the tequila. The actual experience of the taste of tequila can be felt by tasting the tequila in long sips as well as short sips. The liquid should be allowed to stay on the surface of the tongue for a certain amount of time before it has been gulped down and digested. The texture of the spirit will also have to be examined and experienced clearly in order to determine as to whether it is rough or smooth. The tone of the texture will also have to be determined in order to find out if it is sour or bitter and whether the tones are wood, vanilla or anise. 
Features to be watched during tequila tasting Flavor and aroma – The exact feelings and emotions which are experienced at the time of the tequila tasting will have to be noted down in a descriptive manner. The clarity of the tequila will have to be ensured before the results of the evaluation have been noted down and evaluated. Certain kinds of tequila could prove to be defective since there could be problems in the quality of the vinegar. In certain cases, the tequila might be a little musty if the quality of the cork is not good enough. If the process of oxidation has not been performed properly, the taste of the tequila might not prove to be satisfactory. 

Weight and texture – The weight of the tequila will have to be examined carefully in order to find out whether it is light or crisp and the texture will also have to be examined as to whether it is rough or smooth. 

Temperature and spice – The level of spice or sweetness in the tequila will have to be determined and evaluated in the proper manner. 

Total balance – Tequila which has been prepared and aged in the right manner will have the right combination of elements which are present in the right proportion and they will be able to harmonize with each other in the right manner. Sometimes the fragrance of the oak barrel which has been used for aging the tequila will blend completely into the taste of the tequila. This could result in the tequila having a severe dose of pepper in it and the alcohol content in the tequila might also increase. 

Lifetime of the taste – The single and most important feature which will vouch for the quality of the tequila is the amount of time for which the taste of the tequila will linger in the mouth of the person. Sometimes the taste of the tequila will completely vanish and disappear soon after it has entered the mouth of the person. The main reason for this would be that the spirit has not been concentrated in the right manner at the time of preparation and the ingredients were not of the most superior quality. The taste of good quality tequila will continue to be felt in the mouth for 20-30 seconds and sometimes even for a longer time period. 
Apparatus required for tequila tasting The right kind of jigger and glass constitute the apparatus which is needed in order to conduct the process of tequila tasting in the right manner so that the right kind of evaluation of the tequila can also be done. The measuring jigger is used so that the right amount of tequila can be measured and used at that time of the tequila tasting event. A quarter ounce of every kind of tequila will have to be measured in the measuring jigger and used for the purposes of tequila tasting. 

At least three brands of tequila will be tasted and tested at every tequila tasting event. A half ounce of each kind of tequila will constitute one normal regular drink. The small bowl of the jigger can be used in order to measure out the minimum possible quantity. This will also ensure that people who are attending the tequila tasting event are drinking within their responsible limits. 

The glasses which are used during the tequila tasting event are also extremely important and they should be selected carefully. The size as well as the shape of the glasses will have an impact on the taste as well as the fragrance and aroma of the tequila which is being tasted. The most superior quality glasses which are used for tequila tasting have been manufactured by the Germans. 

Riedel crystal glasses are always the recommended option which should be used during a tequila tasting event. These glasses have an extremely long stem and the shape of these glasses is similar to that of fresh wine glasses. They provide a streak of style and elegance for every tequila tasting event. When the glasses used for tequila tasting are crystal clear, it will help the person in evaluating the purity as well as the clarity of the spirit in a proper manner. 
Planning and preparation for a tequila tasting event The first and most important step which needs to be conducted during the process of planning a tequila tasting event is the selection of the right kind of tequila which will be made available during the course of the event. The tequila should be made using the most superior quality ingredients. When people first arrive at the tequila tasting event, they will first take a shot of tequila using the shot glass. The taste of the tequila should be such that people will put away the shot glass and pick up a tequila tasting glass which will enable them to enjoy and savor the taste of the tequila which has been made available to them. 

Apart from serving the right kinds of drinks and tequila at the tequila tasting event, it is also imperative to serve the right kind of food at such an event. The food which is being served should complement the drinks and spirits which are being served. The tequila which is served will sometimes have a taste which is similar to that of vanilla, spices and other flavors and this could be due to the fact that the tequila has been stored in oak barrels for a long period of time for the purposes of aging. 

The most common foods which are served during a tequila tasting event include chilies and jalapeno peppers which will provide the right element of spice which should be felt while tasting the tequilas. A person who has a lot of experience in the field of tequila tasting will have his own special menu which he would like to use during the course of any tequila tasting event. The tequila chili and the tequila shrimp are some of the most common food items which are served during the course of a tequila tasting event. The pineapple tequila salsa and the tequila lime thin steak are also some of the famous items which are served during a tequila tasting event. 

The right kind of music will help in creating the right kind of atmosphere during a tequila tasting event. Soothing jazz is usually the most preferred music option which is used during a tequila tasting program. Some people prefer to use a sultry R&B mix for a tequila tasting program. Most people prefer to engage the services of local musicians for such events.",
Bodybuilding,"Bodybuilding Information  Intro Bodybuilding is considered the king of sports. The ancient statues of Greek gods stand testimony to motivate one to follow this royal sport. Bodybuilding as a hobby helps appreciate the god given body and also keeps one away from harmful distractions like drugs. The human body is a marvel of engineering and bodybuilding compliments its overall enhancement intrinsically and aesthetically. Bodybuilding maximizes muscle growth and muscle strength through a combination of exercises, diet, and rest. Bodybuilding is one of the most popular sports in North America and several competitions are held to determine the most beautiful male and female body in several categories. Bodybuilding is also a hobby that can prove to be quite a rewarding vocation if followed diligently. The first large-scale bodybuilding competition in the US was held at Madison Square Garden in the year 1904. Al Treloar the winner of the title “The Most Perfectly Developed Man in the World” won a cash prize of $1000, a handsome amount in those days. 

The perfect age to seriously start bodybuilding is between 13 – 15 years. Before that age, kids should be encouraged to do push ups, sit ups, and run, to be in good physical condition. At the age of thirteen individuals should have a routine that includes pull ups and dips and a lot of cycling or mountain biking to work the legs. Fifteen is the right age when weight training can be started, though some advocate thirteen is the best age to begin weight training. Early initiation helps kids gain strength and size and if interested can follow other sports to suit them. Till the age of fifteen it is recommended that kids do a full body workout with sufficient rest. Main power exercises can begin once the kid has crossed the age of fifteen. 
Workouts Ideally teenagers should workout three days a week. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Monday being the first day of the week it should be reserved for a heavy workout. On Mondays bench press, squats and power cleans - 5 sets of 3 repetitions. Heavy workouts increases the strength and makes the major muscles stronger. Initially it will be difficult to complete 3 repetitions, however once you are able to do that increase the weight. After the main exercise you may train your arms, calves and abs. Do not over train other muscles. 

Wednesdays light workout of squats, incline and pull ups - 3 sets of 8 repetitions. If you can do more repetitions do so in the third set with increase in weight. After this main exercise you may work on the other body parts lightly. Take care not to over train and leave the gym in one hour. 

On Fridays workout should be of medium intensity - 5 sets of 5 reps of clean and press, barbell rows and squats. Once you are able to do 5 reps in the 5th set increase the weight. You may do barbell curls for your biceps and crunches before leaving the gym. 

This type of training is ideal for teenagers to begin building lean muscle mass, strength and speed; the form on every repetition should be maintained. Nutrition also is very important teenagers diet should include peanut butter, milk, eggs, meat, chicken, whole wheat breads, fruits and vegetables. It is important to watch your weight in case you notice you are gaining fat cut down on part of your meals. 

Now lets see how someone who has never lifted weights before the age of 30 should train. 

In case you decide on bodybuilding relatively late in life it is recommended that you first consult your physician. Once the doctor gives you a green signal you need to list out what you want to achieve and what are your expectations from weight training. Set up your own realistic goals. Remember it takes time to see change in size or strength, so give yourself at least two months before looking for results. Persistence and dedication is needed to achieve your goals. 

Your training program will depend on a few things like your motivation, and genetic potential. It is advisable to take guidance from a trained professional in putting together a training program. 

If you have never lifted any weights in your life and are absolutely new to bodybuilding then you should start with exercises that don`t involve weight lifting. Follow the simple routine as below and as you increase your strength and muscle mass, you may consider training with weights under the supervision of a trainer. 
Sets Shoulder width grip chin ups. Your goal should be 50 chin ups. No matter how many repetitions you can manage per set try and complete 50 chin ups. There is a chance that you wont be able to do even one but keep trying and complete 50 repetitions. After the first few weeks increase the number of repetitions per set. If chin ups are proving difficult you may do front pull downs. Chin ups is the best exercise for beginners to get broad, strong shoulders. 

Parallel bar dips. An excellent exercise for the chest, deltoids, and triceps. Use a grip that is slightly wider than your shoulders. Do 5 sets of 15 repetitions each, this exercise is very good to develop strength in your chest and triceps. If you lean forward and do dips, you train your chest and if you keep yourself straight and do dips you workout your triceps and deltoids. 

Crunches. Crunches exercise your abdomen muscles and tones them up. Lie flat on your back and place your feet against the wall or on the seat of a chair in such a way that your lower legs form a right angle with your upper legs and your upper legs form a right angle with your torso. Place your hands behind your head or across your chest throughout the exercise. Now using your abdomen muscles lift the upper body. Concentrate on the effort and don`t care to go too high. Do 3 or 4 sets of maximum repetitions you can manage. 

A note of caution: you will feel very sore and your muscles will feel tight after your first workout. Rest for four to five days after your first workout and from there on train four days a week. After you have followed this routine for three months you will be sufficiently strong to work with light weights. Start with barbell squats, 3 sets of 15 repetitions before you do shoulder width chin ups. After this you can do 3 sets of 12 repetitions each of bench press before the parallel bar dips. So your ideal routine should be 3 sets of squats, 50 chin ups, 3 sets of bench press, and 5 sets of 15 reps of parallel bar dips. This routine has to be followed for two months and then you can add barbell curls for biceps after bench press, military press, shrugs for shoulders, calf raises. You can then split your training over two days. Day one should include 2 sets of squats of 15 reps each, bench press 2 sets 15 reps each, chin ups 2 sets of maximum reps you can manage, and 3 sets of crunches. Day two should include 2 sets of military press of 12 reps each, parallel bar dips 2 sets of 12 reps each, shrugs 1 set of 15 repetitions, calf raises 2 sets of 25 reps each and 3 sets of reverse crunches. 

It is recommended you buy a chin and dip station costing about $250 to $350 from a reputed fitness equipment supplier or if you are technically inclined you may fabricate the same less than $100 in your garage itself. You may do your crunches without a sit up board; an adjustable sit up board costs about $150. A barbell with around 300 pounds of free weight and a pair of spring collars is sufficient for beginners and costs around $250. Apart form this you will require a flat bench for bench press. This is all the equipment you need to get you started. 

You will need to do two workouts per week for strength and muscle gain, by the end of 4 months you will begin to see increase in size and strength. Just take care not to over train in your enthusiasm. Each work out should be less than one hour. Eat a balanced meal containing green vegetables, fruits, milk, whole wheat bread, chicken, fish, and red meat. Spread your daily diet over 5 to 6 small meals a day. Give your body sufficient rest between workouts it is also important for muscle growth. Sleep for at least eight hours a night.   Six months of bodybuilding training is enough to take you to the next level.",
Paper Airplanes,"Paper Airplanes Information  Introduction When the term ‘paper airplane’ is tossed around, an image is often conjured up of children playing in a schoolyard or in the backyard of their home, taking sheets of paper from their school books and folding them into the shapes of airplanes and seeing how far they can get them to fly, or how long they can get them airborne. It has been almost a rite of passage for many young boys to be able to make paper airplanes that can stay in the air and fly longer and farther than all of their friends’ paper airplanes. 

Yet there is actually a great deal of science that goes into paper airplane making and there are engineers around the world who continually experiment with paper airplanes, trying to get them to fly farther, faster, and better than ever before. Some of these technological, yet simplistic, innovations also help other engineers design better aircrafts, more aerodynamic machines, and even to create the potential for new styles of flying devices. 

It can be argued that the first paper airplane was flown at Kitty Hawk in 1904 by the Wright brothers. That first actual airplane flight was built on the construction of basic, yet strong, paper wings. While the rest of that airplane was built out of wood and some bolts and screws, it was the wings that defined it and made it work because of the lightweight material. That initial flight began an era of aviation that continues to bloom to this day. 

It is important to note however, that paper airplanes have actually been around for thousands of years. In fact, the origin of the paper airplane can be traced back to around 500 B.C. in China, where this culture began making paper and creating artistic structures called origami. 

Paper airplane making and flying is so popular in some cultures that there are competitions for the most aerodynamic, most intricate, and best flying paper airplanes. Adults can even spend countless hours designing their paper airplanes to achieve the right amount of lift and loft that will help it fly farther than ever before. The reason that paper airplanes are important to modern aviation has to do with aerodynamics at its core. 

If a paper airplane design can sustain loft and duration farther than any paper airplane previous, its design could give clues to how modern aircrafts can take advantage of those principles in order to save on fuel efficiency as well as reach a maximum speed. 

Paper airplanes are actually based on the ancient Japanese art form known as origami and utilizes the method of folding paper along certain lines and angles to create the paper airplane. Different fold angles, cuts, and additions for the most basic paper airplanes can change their trajectory as well as their loft and elevation. More complex paper airplanes that are engineered are actually built with a number of strong sheets of paper, glue, and other components that keep it together. 

For most average hobbyists, however, paper airplane making and flying comes down to being able to take one single sheet of paper and create an airborne flying device. 
Basics of Making a Paper Airplane When first starting out making paper airplanes as a hobby, it’s best to start out slow, and not try to overreach and create the world’s fastest and most aerodynamic paper airplane that’s ever been created. If you ever made paper airplanes as a young child, then that would be a great starting point to get back into the rhythm of making paper airplanes. 

If, on the other hand, you have never made a paper airplane in your life, then you need to begin with the very basics. A basic paper airplane is generally constructed out of a single, uncut sheet of paper. Regular note pad paper of the traditional eight-by-eleven inch size (US) or A4 (Eurpoean) size is ideal. In the future, as you begin to become more comfortable with making your own paper airplanes, then you will be able to start cutting your original size down to create the perfect plane that you have in mind, or have designed. 

The basic steps to constructing a paper airplane are as follows: 

1. Fold the sheet of paper in half. 

2. Unfold and, using the crease down the center as a guide, fold in a ninety-degree angle on the front of the paper. The top portion of the paper (the narrow end) should meet and align with the crease. 

3. Repeat step two for the other side. Now you have a ‘fuselage’ and ‘nose’ of the paper airplane. 

4. Fold the paper in half along the previously created crease. 

5. Now fold down about one to two inches worth of paper from the upper edge of what would be the wing section. This forms your wing. 

6. Repeat step 5 and you have completed your first paper airplane. 

When you begin to see how the paper airplane flies, you will be able to experiment with different construction principles to try and get the paper airplane to do different things, such as float for a long period of time, do loops and twists along the air currents, and much more. 

As an example, take the paper airplane that you just created and fold the wings down at a different angle. In other words, rather than having the wings set at a parallel line to the fuselage, make them angle upward or downward and you will see that the paper airplane’s path will be drastically altered. 

The longer your paper airplane is, and if the thickness of the paper doesn’t change, then you may notice that the entire structure will be influenced by a breeze or changes in the air’s natural currents. This can cause fluctuations in the flight path or pattern and you can also experiment with these nuances as well. 

Making your own paper airplanes can be an interesting experiment in trying to recreate the same results at different times. It is unlikely that every single paper airplane you create will be exactly the same, unless you take painstaking effort to make sure that they are. When you first set out to make your own paper airplane, make it fun. If you have children, this can be a great activity to do with them while teaching them the fundamentals of aerodynamics and engineering while learning about them yourself. 
Advanced Design If you consider yourself more of an advanced paper airplane designer, then perhaps it’s time for you to being developing your designs before sitting down with the paper and folding and cutting your shapes into existence. There are a number of computer programs that can be used to lay out the design of your paper airplane. Programs such as CAD designers can offer an opportunity to work with aerodynamics and move beyond the basic structure of the origami style paper airplanes. 

The concept of basic paper airplanes, such as those designed on the origami model, have major aerodynamic flaws that are inherent in their design. These types of paper airplanes create a number of drag problems, along with the aforementioned susceptibility to wind and current changes. 

Also, many modern scientists are using other products to build their paper airplanes, such as balsa wood and glue to hold everything together. Though paper of a thicker weight, is generally stronger per square inch than balsa wood. When building a paper airplane in more advanced fashion, you will not be limited to the basic forms and structures. If you are interested in the more advanced form of paper airplane design, then there are just about as many different books and programs to choose from as there are paper airplane designs. You will simply need to go through them and figure out which one makes sense to you and which ones are the most practical for your efforts. 
Aerodynamics The traditional model of paper airplanes based on origami have one major design flaw, besides the paper that it is constructed out of. The most glaring, when compares with actual airplane designs of modern flight, has to do with the weight displacement throughout the aircraft itself. With paper airplanes, the weight is distributed evenly throughout the design. 

Aerodynamics predicates that certain regions and sections of an aircraft carry more weight than others in other to allow it to fly, fly smoothly, and stay airborne longer. In modern aircrafts, though, there is propulsion that is taken into account and therefore the wings tend to be farther back on the aircraft, which is why, when there is engine failure, the plane tends to dip down nose first. 

With advanced paper airplane design, the most important factor to consider is about where the weight should be placed for maximum efficiency of form and function. You may find that wings toward the front of the plane with a majority of the weight may be the answer to keep it aloft longer. Or you may discover that a plane with narrower wings might create a more resilient flying craft. 

Studying basic aerodynamics can go a long way toward designing and building paper airplanes that defy tradition. Who knows, you could end of creating the perfect flying machine right there in your own work station. 
Frequently Asked Questions Are there paper airplane flying competitions? If so, where? 

Yes. There are a number of paper airplane flying competitions around the world, often sponsored and promoted by engineering departments in universities or companies that invest in aviation engineering. To find them, go online and search ‘paper airplane competitions’ using any of the major search engines and you will likely find a list of organizations that sponsor this exciting and rewarding hobby. 

How many more ways can a paper airplane be made? I mean, it still must follow the basic design, right? 

That all depends. The most common paper airplanes have the same basic shape and structure, but that doesn’t mean that all of them have to follow that model. Most people recognize planes as having wings, but there have been designs that have worked well with a different form of elevational thrust. The key is to use one’s imagination and experiment. Who knows, the next ‘out of the box’ design that changes the world of aviation could be from you. 

What do I need to start paper airplane flying? 

Your imagination and some paper. You can pick up tips online for designs, or buy a book on how to make the best paper airplanes. Once you have the basics down, you can move from there and design your own paper airplanes and see what you can discover about them. 
Conclusion Paper airplanes are often thought of as being for children, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. In fact, paper airplane flying is taken quite seriously by a number of engineers around the world who strive to improve and advance aviation globally. What makes paper airplanes so important to modern aviation is its susceptibility to wind and currents, which can teach a lot about how a particular design can take advantage of those currents. 

Yet even as a hobby, paper airplanes can be a great way to spend time with friends or family, learning about the different types of paper airplanes and how to improve on existing designs. For fathers and sons, making paper airplanes together can be a wonderful way to bond, spend time together, and help the child learn to think through a problem, design a solution, and set about creating the paper airplane from a blank sheet of paper. 

When we think about paper airplanes, we are often directed to the notion of boys playing on the schoolyard tossing their ragged, ill-conceived and basic paper airplanes into the wind and watching them either float elegantly in the air or crash hard onto the ground. But there is an opportunity for adults to recapture some of those carefree days of youth by learning to build paper airplanes and seeing just what they can come up with today.",
Ballet,"Ballet Information  Why learn ballet out of all dance forms? Ballet has always been considered as a unique dance form that can improve co-ordination, memory, posture and rhythm. Movements involved in ballet help a dancer to bring beauty and grace in the body movements. This dance form can be learnt by anyone at home. One important reason why many people get attracted to ballet is that it not only promotes cardiovascular exercise and strengthens the muscles of back and abdomen, but also tones the body. You can learn this dance at home as well and gain a healthy mind and body. This can be a hobby, which is effective in development of creativity, poise, responsibility and focus. Those who learn ballet, find it easy to channelize their energy in the right direction and in a constructive manner. It helps them learn non-verbal communication and appreciate music. Learning ballet can be a fun and enjoyable experience. The discipline you learn can be applied to other aspects in your life like in school, at work, within relationships or for good health. Surprisingly, a few years back, some engineers started a ballet company because according to them there was a lot in common between ballet and engineering as far as structural dynamics are concerned. For more interesting information on getting started with this dance form and making it a vitalizing and fun hobby, this article can be of help to you. 
Equipment required for learning ballet: Ballet shoes are the most important equipment required for learning this beautiful dance form. It is not only important, but also fun to wear these elegant ballet shoes. They have a very pleasing design and are made of soft material so that you are able to move with grace and strength while dancing. When you purchase ballet shows always remember to buy ones that are made of leather and not canvas, as they will last longer. The closure on flat ballet shoes should also be considered. Purchase shoes from a discount store rather than opting for expensive ones. When you learn the dance, you can buy expensive shoes. You need to be very comfortable to maneuver your body. You should buy tight fitting ‘tights’ to move nicely when practicing. Ballet barre is the third important equipment used for balancing. This can be expensive so try and find the best deal. If you cannot afford this then make use of any rod or solid surface that is at or above your waist. 
Pursuing ballet as your hobby:This is one dance form that can be pursued as a hobby by anyone who has the much needed will and interest. Nowadays, many people are learning ballet due to its numerous health benefits. You can either join ballet classes according to your daily schedule or learn it at home. It can be a good mental exercise whether you learn it at home or in a class. The kind of refreshed perspective it provides will help to clear your mind of all tension, even if you were upset when you started the session. If you cannot join classes due to your schedule, lack of adult ballet classes or expense, then try learning it at home. Since a trained ballerina needs years of instruction, you will also have to put in lot of effort.   The cheapest and easiest way of becoming a good ballet dancer could be searching the Internet for videos and ballet guides. If you don’t have access to the Internet then buy a video, DVD or book on the subject. Make sure that you buy a book or DVD that provides you some inspiration to learn this dance. The steps must be represented visually in the book or DVD so that you learn the right moves because in case you do a step incorrectly, your might get hurt. Once you have finalized the source through which you would be learning this dance form, you will have to find a place in your house that is suitable enough for practice. Having a lot of floor space in your house can be an added advantage, but in an opposite case, create space by moving the furniture of your living room to one corner for practice. Wooden flooring is the best for learning ballet as too much of turning and jumping will not hurt the way it can on a concrete or carpeted floor. Before you start practicing, it is essential to do some warm up exercises like bends, so that you are ready to face complex floor work. Music is another factor that is essential in learning ballet. Choose a music piece that has a lot of rhythm and suits the steps. The steps you select should be done with the help of the balancing aid and after a lot of practice sessions you must try doing it without the balancing aid. Make sure that you are cautious while attempting the big jumps and other fun ballet steps. In case you want to take ballet classes, make sure that it is a good one that provides adequate instructions. You can get injured if a qualified teacher doesn`t train you. 

If you want to make the most out of your ballet lessons at home or in a class then there are few tips and warnings that you need to remember in order to make your ballet learning experience an enjoyable experience: 

• There are chances that you might not succeed in your first attempt, but don’t lose hope. Keep practicing until you master a step. • Even if you are learning at home try to attend ballet classes once or twice a month so that a trained professional can see what you have learnt and where you are going wrong, if at all. It can be a totally different experience for you to attend a class and learn it under the supervision of a professional. • Ballet is a beautiful dance but there are few complex steps that can hurt any beginner if attempted in haste. There are chances that you might get injured if you don’t follow the process step by step. It is good to have someone at home when you practice so that in case of injuries you can get immediate help. Always remember that ballet dancing is a gradual endeavor and you can get disappointed if you are expecting fast results. Give time to your body to respond to every learning session and with small strides, you will be able to see a significant change in few days. Great deal of determination and focus can make you a very good ballet dancer. You can visit online sites dedicated to the dance form for more useful information on the steps and benefits of ballet. An excellent variety of books and videos are also available. 
Types of Ballet Technicality is one word we’d like to stress on when we talk of ballet because it is known to have its own vocabulary basically taught in ballet schools all over the world. Considering the various movements depicting the storylines of each performance, ballet has got to have some kind of history right? It does and it goes way back to the 15th century. Surprising enough, ballet actually came to be as a dance elucidation of the art of fencing. Yeah, it’s quite hard to believe but that is exactly how it all began in the Renaissance court of Italy. Ballet was then modernized in France, which truly explains the French terms used in the art of ballet. 

Towards mid 18th century, ballet spread out its roots to Denmark and subsequently Russia. This is exactly why ballet’s techniques are now known to many as French ballet, Russian Vaganova method and of course, Italian Cecchetti method. As a ballet enthusiast, you’d like to know the different forms of ballet that you can learn, oh yes, we said forms, there are three to be more precise. The first form is the classical ballet wherein it follows the rules strictly laid down by tradition ballet. This may vary a little with respect to the style due to the place of origins. This means that the variations could be seen in forms of French, Italian and the Russian ballet. The second form would be the neoclassical ballet. This differs a bit from the former in the sense that although this style uses the same vocabulary that is seen with respect of traditional ballet, the movements are a bit more unyielding in a way. Simply put, the performers are more likely to perform some more technical and extreme feats during their performances. This usually makes the neoclassical form more complex and modern than our traditional ballet performances. The theatrical/visual setting for this form of ballet is particularly strong and its style is a bit more narrative. 

Last but not the least; we have the contemporary form of ballet. This form has been received quite well by avid dancers and teachers being a mix between classical ballet and modern dance. This form of ballet has got more movements than what are traditionally taught at ballet schools. This becomes more than evident from the movements usually used in the 20th century dance forms with many turn-ins in the legs, a lot of floor work, etc. 

So that’s ballet for you, it could be a great hobby, preparing you physically as well as mentally at the various challenges that life has to throw at you. Sounds a bit over the top??? Well, ballet can help you prepare for life in a way. Hey, how can putting on some pink tights and black leotard help me with my life, besides, it’s not like I’m in a spoof of “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy/Girl”? Did you happen to read something interesting in there? No!!! Not the thing about queer, but the guy part. Yes, that’s right, even guys can set their foot in the waters of ballet. I mean the movie “Billy Elliot” quite created a rage you know. The bottom line is that ballet is for everyone; no doubt the steps are a bit demanding to accomplish. But it does prepare you for the toughest life’s lessons. Ballet helps to give you that focus in life that you had always yearned for. It teaches you how to follow the rules without any distractions, gives you the concentration when you have your goal right in front of you and gives you a certain self esteem and confidence so that you can tackle even the most difficult of all situations. It invokes a certain amount of self-respect in you and perhaps the most important lesson that it teaches is to finish what you had started in the first place. 

Ballet as a hobby can quite give you the thrill and that enjoying experience you were always looking for. Sure, going for your first ballet lesson could be a bit “nerve wrecking” but nevertheless, choose a good ballet instructor and you’ll slowly be on your way to learning a traditional dance form. It doesn’t matter if you want to take up ballet as a professional dance form or you’re one of those who are just keen enough to learn a few of their moves. This hobby is fun and it doesn’t really matter how old you are, you can always stop by to take some lessons. It could also help you in improving your posture and your reflexes. Ballet is truly a fascinating dance genre that gives the dancer a feeling of beauty, grace and discipline. One of the most fascinating moves of ballet would quite aptly be dancing on your toes. The scene from Titanic in which Kate Winslet does a toe stand demonstrates ballet in its rawest form. And the reaction that she got from the crowd(that of astonishment) simply proves that ballet is one thing that can capture the audience’s attention. 

So yeah, why not consider taking up ballet as a hobby, besides, unlike other forms of dance, ballet quite has the ability of transporting its audience to a different world altogether. Practice, hard work and dedication is needed in order to take this hobby seriously and along the way you are bound to have some fun and learn some of the lessons that life has to teach you.",
Ferrets,"Ferrets Information  Introduction One of the slowest hobbies to catch on in the pet industry has been the ferret. Perhaps it is because they are one of the newest pets on the market, being considered rare prior to the 1980’s, but the ferret is one of the most interesting small animals on the market right now and its popularity is quickly. Not only are they unique to the world of small animal pets, but Ferrets are great entertainers. They are very active and you will hardly ever see them not playing or scurrying about in their cages. You will have the best time having them around the house especially if you have kids who would love watching these little furry animals in action. In a lot of ways, their activity levels are a lot like puppies; they love to jump and play for short periods of time, and then it is time for a short rest. Quite similar to other small animals, ferrets are fairly inexpensive pets that only require the most modest accommodations, and if they are kept in good health, they can live up to ten years old. They are also especially great for small children because they will keep them entertained for hours with the distinct personalities that they have. This is one of the most entertaining hobbies to join right now, and if the trends with ferrets are the same with everyone, you simply cannot stop at having just one ferret. 
Purchasing Your First Ferret One of the most debated issues in North America right now is whether to purchase from a private breeder, a pet store, or an animal shelter. Here is an argument that is based on a few too many bad apples spoiling it for the bunch. But over the past ten to twenty years, there have been numerous cases of poor quality ferrets being sold by people thinking only of profit as their animals suffer from neglect. Thankfully, there have been numerous enthusiasts stepping forward to challenge pet stores to live up to the higher standards people expect from them. Because of the fairly new inclusion of ferrets onto the pet industry two decades ago, there has been a steady incline in the ferret population that has led to a handful of ferrets being surrendered to animal shelters. Although it is great if you can save a ferret from an animal shelter and give it a second lease at life, there is also nothing wrong with purchasing a ferret from a store or private breeder. The fact is that you will probably want a specific color of ferret that only a breeder or store can get you so a shelter is probably right out. You just have to remember that pet stores purchase ferrets from breeders and mark up the prices, so it would in fact be considerably cheaper purchasing a ferret from a breeder. 

As a general rule of thumb, always try to purchase the healthiest ferret available. This is easily done by purchasing the largest in a group that has bright eyes and is active. Larger animals typically mean that they are being well fed and cared for. With ferrets, assuming they are well taken care of, they will generally all be of the same size and weight when you see them in a pet store window or in a group at a breeders residence. If a ferret is skinny and not active, then it is best to leave it be. It’s far too easy to succumb to a sick kitten pulling at your heart strings, but when it comes to cat illnesses, there is a steep financial cost to making a sick ferret well again. A healthy animal can live many years, and if you put in the time that is necessary, you will be rewarded in the long run. The last thing you have to remember is that ferrets have a distinct musky scent that is always present. Many people will descent their ferrets, but this does not change the day to day smell, but rather removes the glands that produce the strong scent when they are startled. 
Required Equipment Due to their unique nature, Ferrets do need a hand full of supplies that will ensure they are happy and healthy during their ten year life. It is through these supplies that you will spend the most money on ferrets, but compared to other pets, ferrets are one of the leat expensive pets on the market right now. The main thing that every ferret needs is an enclosure to spend most of the day. Since they sleep for a majority of the day anyway, its pen is generally the place for the ferret to sleep. But since ferrets love to jump, run, and play, it is crucial to have a large, multi-level enclosure. Since they do love to snuggle up and sleep in the most comfortable positions, ferrets love to cuddle up in a cozy baby blanket, a hanging hammock, or anything else they think is a comfy sleeping object. 

A ferret is easily trained to use a litter box, since they prefer to urinate and defecate in the same corner of their cage. When placed in a new area, it is common for a ferret to mark the area with its droppings. After it gets acquainted to the area, it will naturally favor a certain location. A litter box filled with about one inch of non-toxic litter is placed there. Cat litter boxes are commonly used; additionally, pet stores sell small animal litter boxes marketed toward small rabbits and ferrets. Most pet stores carry safe litter that is easy to handle, clean, and absorbent. Clay based cat litter, scented cat litter and clumping cat litter should not be used with rabbits. It is also highly recommended to place litter containers throughout your house if you are going to be letting your ferret loose during the day. Since they are so focused on playing and exploring, they sometimes forget they have to go to the bathroom until it is too late. 

Other than the actual cage, there really isn’t any other equipment that is essential. Most ferret owners will purchase a collar similar to that of a cat to show off the ferret’s personality. Same goes with the ferrets water and food containers that will always be present in their cage, a water bottle can also be used with ferrets. A good suggestion is to have dishes that lock into the cage to prevent tipping. Since ferrets can be rambunctious at the best of time, if you can prevent one spill, you will have time to clean up another. The other thing that isn’t necessary but your ferret will love you for is a large selection of toys. Since they love to play so much, it is a great idea to ensure they have a large variety of toys so they never get board and turn to your personal possession to use as chew toys. 
A Specialized Diet Ferrets are obligate carnivores, meaning that they require a carnivore diet to be healthy, and food passes through the digestive system of a ferret very quickly. Since ferret’s lack the ability to derive nutrition from plant materials, a ferret’s diet must be high in animal protein, high in fat, and low in fiber. Due mainly to the fact that Ferrets have only been considered domesticated pets for twenty years, they have unique feeding requirements, which are now finally being addressed by commercial pet food manufacturers with varying degrees of success. All foods, including foods intended solely for ferrets, are not created equally, so be careful what you are feeding your ferret. Like every other pet in the world, there is a high degree of research that should be done prior to taking a new pet home. 

Since Ferrets have a quick metabolism along with a short digestive system, there is a need to eat frequently, which is typically every three to four hours. For this reason, it is best to have food available constantly, and in addition, most ferrets will eat only enough to meet their needs. This generally helps to prevent obesity since they will not overeat if allowed constant access to good quality food. Fresh, clean water is also a necessity at all times. If you are having a problem with your ferret gaining too much weight, check with a vet to rule out a medical problem, and your vet can also give you advice on meeting their diet needs while maintaining a good weight. Increased exercise is usually the best way to approach obesity once health problems are ruled out, rather than diet restrictions, and since ferrets love to play, play, play, exercise usually not an issue. 

Dry foods are the most convenient choice, as they can be left available at all times without concern of spoilage. Canned ferret food can be given as a treat or supplement, but only occasionally. There are several ferret diets available now, and some are better than others. The one highly debated item, which is generally the same with all dry animal foods, is in regards to cat food is the inclusion of animal byproducts into the food. A majority of lesser quality foods support the fact that animal-by-products should be in all ferret foods. What is an animal-by-product? Think of a ferret food that has chicken-by-product in the ingredient list, and then imagine that the whole chicken has gone into making that ferret food compared to a food using chicken meal, which is only the actual meat of the chicken. The argument behind by-products is that in the wild, ferrets will eat the whole animal. This of course if absolutely true, but it not necessarily good for them to eat a whole chicken. These lesser quality pet foods are misleading because if makes it seem like you are feeding your pet chicken when you are actually feeding you ferret chicken and random parts of that chicken. 

As the pet industry becomes more specialized, certain practices become obsolete, and one of these practices was to feed premium dry cat or kitten food, but that recommendation is now considered out-of-date. As the science of ferret nutrition improves, there is little doubt that premium ferret diets are the best to feed ferrets. If for some reason, you are unable to find a good quality ferret food, and also cannot find ferret food on the internet, then you may have to settle for cat food. If this is the case, then you have to purchase a high quality kitten food from a pet store. You have to use kitten food because is high in high in protein, but as your ferret gets a bit older, approximately 4 years old, switch to an adult food. Again, you must check labels, and pick foods with only high quality animal proteins at the top of the ingredient list, and make sure they are high in fat and very low in grains, sugar, and fiber. Avoid generic or ""grocery store"" brands at all costs, as these are typically very poor for ferrets. 
Conclusion Not only are Ferrets unique to the world of small animal, but Ferret keeping can be one of the most rewarding hobbies available to the largest group of people. Where most animals are not good for small children, Ferrets are the perfect choice because they are the perfect entertainers, they love the constant attention and can feed off of a child’s energy level, and they are in no way aggressive or violent towards humans. Plus due to their inexpensive equipment needs and actual cost of themselves, they are available to people of all walks of life, and if they are taken care of well, they can live a respectful ten year life. Perhaps the only downside to the animal is the strong musky scent that tends to throw people off. Even after they have had their scent glands removed, there is still a smell that is unique to the ferret, but at least they will not erupt with it when startled. With the help of a knowledgeable veterinarian in your local city, you will be able to ensure that your newest pets are as happy and healthy as can be. Should you run into other problems, there are also numerous ferret groups in cities and even more present on the internet than give you a hand in a moment’s notice. As far as hobbies go, the keeping of ferrets ranks at the very top of the most accessible and entertaining hobbies to join.",
Horseback Riding,"Horseback Riding Information  Intro There’s a fabulous sense of adventure associated with horseback riding because it instantly brings to mind a feeling of freedom with the wind blowing in your hair as your horse trots or gallops! When you decide to take up horseback riding as a hobby, you also enjoy many other benefits. Your perception of nature improves manifold as you also enjoy several health benefits. Look at these: • Fitness and health – horse riding is a great exercise that tones your body

• Horse riding is an excellent confidence builder as well as making you more disciplined.   You get to meet likeminded people when you go horseback riding. Spending time with a horse and therefore with nature can be a pleasant experience. Horses are known for their intelligence and loyalty. Learning horseback riding is not difficult or expensive, so you can rest assured that your hobby will not burn a hole in your pocket. It is not necessary to own a horse to learn to ride it since you can rent both the horse and the accessories you need to go riding. 

In addition to all the above advantages, your hobby of horseback riding could well open up opportunities for you to take part in polo, racing, dressage, rodeo, fox hunting, etc. turning your hobby into a part time or full time profession depending on how much time you want to spend on it. 
Getting Started With The Hobby Apart from being a lot of fun, horseback riding can be a rewarding experience letting you discover the horse lover in you. All you need is the right gear, a good instructor to get started. Did you know there are different styles of horseback riding? We basically hear about the Western and English style. People usually feel that western can be learned more easily since the English style can be tough. If your aim is to learn horse riding for fun, go in for the western. If you intend participating in shows, etc. then it would be a good idea to learn the English style. Children invariably start with bareback. The English and western differ in that western riders hold the reins with one hand and English hold the reins with both hands. But no matter which style you decide to learn, you must remember to sit up straight with your toes pointed forward and your heels down. Also, never forget to look where you are heading. You must, at all times, show kindness towards the horse and make sure you don’t lose your temper or get irritated.   
What You Will Need In Terms Of Horseback Riding Gear You will need some basic gear, starting with the saddle, reins and stirrups and you can rent these from wherever you plan to learn. At the time of enrolling you can check for a good fit so that you have a comfortable ride. It is necessary to ensure that your horseback riding lessons are safe, so don’t forget to wear a helmet. Here’s a must-have list: 

• Well fitting clothing with your shirt tucked in • Breeches or thick leg wear. Jeans are okay but the stitches down the inside of the legs can chafe and hurt. • Preferably go in for an ASTM approved helmet • Riding boots that have about a one-inch heel so that you can avoid your foot from slipping through the stirrup. • Accessories, which are optional, are riding gloves, chaps, boots etc. 
Choosing Your Riding Stable You can look around or ask for the stables in your locality, shortlist a few and personally check them out. You can take a look at the horses and their stalls here. Good stables will take proper care of their horses. Check whether the staff readily answers questions you might have. Most stables require you to sign a liability waiver. Get all the information about schedule for the lessons and the fees applicable. 

Other things you can take a note of are whether the horses and their stalls are clean. Since this is a hobby where safety is very important there’s no harm in clearing any doubts you might have. 
Your First Lesson Do not forget to inform your instruction if you are learning horseback riding for the first time. This will help them choose a horse that is gentle, slow and well trained. First lessons are generally one on one and last a maximum of half an hour. During the first few lessons you will also learn to saddle your horse and be instructed on how to ride safely. The instructor will show you how to lead the horse and how to mount and dismount your horse. You are also asked to practice walking the horse. Your instructor will teach you how to ask your horse to move forward and stop in your first lesson. You will learn the right thing to do when there are other riders around. Most horseback riding lessons are once a week and this is preferable, as it will help you keep in touch with what you learn. 

Horseback riding as a hobby is a very pleasurable thing and with the right instructor there’s no limit to your enjoyment.

Balloon Art,"Balloon Art Information Balloon Art 101Remember those days when you would go to a carnival, eat some popcorn and hotdogs, ride the roller coaster, play some games and watch some clowns concoct dozens of inflated balloons into beautiful shapes that you would wear on your body or take home?  Today, balloon art or modeling is not only used to amuse children but also to catch the attention of adults at events or parties. It is a lucrative business that is flourishing without us even noticing. Where It All Began  Long ago, even before latex was created to form balloons, there was a way to make these puffed up wonders. In the European regions, bladders, intestines and even stomachs of animals were thin enough to be inflated and used to amuse them with.  During the early 1800’s, Professor Michael Faraday was experimenting with gases and raw rubber when he suddenly created a balloon made from rubber called caoutchouc. His work was probably the first to join the balloons with hydrogen as he kept a journal of what he was working on.  As early as 1889, balloons were bought in the United States. It is important to note that these were not really designed in the US, but as a matter of fact, a good number of them happen to have been imported from countries like Belgium, and for a fair price too. In general they would cost around four cents each or forty cents for a dozen.  Balloons manufacturing in the US began around 1907 by Anderson Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio. The first recorded change of balloon shape was 1912 when instead of having the round shaped balloon, long cigar-shaped rubbers were manufactured.  This was as a matter of fact due to the efforts of one Harry Ross Gill, who went on to be the founding father of the National Latex Rubber Products of Ashland, Ohio.  In 1931, Neil Tillotson dipped the first modern latex balloon made from the sap of a rubber tree. They made the first novelty-shaped and printed balloons. Prior to that, balloons were made by a solvent- dissolved rubber comparable to rubber cement. The rubber company he founded is still in operation to date as a matter of fact.  At the Italian Village of the Chicago World’s Fair during 1933-1934, Sally Rand, one of the dancers used balloons for her performance which were pumped by foot at the moment arranged. These measured about five feet in diameter and cost around $28.50 each. Unfortunately, problems came up and the balloons would pop during her show. It was later discovered that someone from the audience shot paper clips using a slingshot to burst the balloons. These were later prevented by lowering a silk curtain that would stop these incidents from happening and it made sure that the audiences view would not be blocked.  The development of balloons skyrocketed. During World War II, special balloons were made. One of these balloons was inflated to five feet in diameter and about twenty feet long which was used as a target. It was used in the Army’s development of the bazooka anti-tank gun.  Eventually, hydrogen was replaced with helium. Although hydrogen had more lifting power, helium proved to be safer. After the change, new possibilities arose. Balloons were used in shops and people hung them on parade floats.     How Balloons Are Made  Balloons are made from latex and the colors are added by the pigment mixed into the latex.  Latex comes from the sap of a rubber tree or Heveabrasiliensis which grows in Malaysia. Once the sap is collected, it is mixed with accelerators, curing agents, color, oil and water to make it apt for balloon production. After all of these are mixed, they are formed by machines then baked for 20-25 minutes in 200-220 degrees Fahrenheit. When cured, balloons are removed from their form.  Here are the steps they go through when they are created by automated machines:  •             acid bath is done once every eight hours or every round  •             a clean water bath of refreshed water  •             brushing is done  •             warming the bath to 70 - 80 degrees Celsius  •             first coagulant bath is used for beading the edge of the balloon (70 degree Celsius)  •             then, the second coagulant bath for the balloon (70 degrees Celsius)  •             they are then placed in the oven for drying the coagulant (when doing this, you must remember to give the bath an appropriate slant, and leave it upright too. This way you will be able to make sure that you get a good result)  •             after that you allow the latex to dip  •             Back to the oven for setting latex film  •             beading  •             leaching  •             use two ovens usually within a temperature range of 80 - 90 degrees Celsius  •             you will need to cool it down, and this you can do through the use of 2 tanks  •             through the use of rollers or the air, you can then do the stripping              Learning Balloon Art  There are numerous ways to learn balloon modeling. Now, there are written instructions that you could download or find over the Internet. If you would like to take it a step further, you could watch a video on the Internet or take a class to earn a certificate to make yourself an official balloon artist.  First, let’s make a run down on what we need. These are just the basics because the list could go on and on depending on the occasion.  1.            Avoid buying cheap balloons because most likely, these are old and will not last long when used. You will need quality balloons. They come in different shapes and sizes which can be found at party suppliers or your best option would be to buy from the manufacturer and maybe they have an online store for you to view the balloons.  2.            A hand pump for large scale balloon decorations but if you are at a party and entertaining kids, go for the old fashioned mouth-blowing activity. It’s very impressive how some can blow a long balloon within seconds. It’s part of the act and can garner a lot of attention.  3.            Always leave space at the tail of the balloon. You need to keep in mind that these balloons will be twisted and shaped into various forms. There needs to be a place for the air to go after bubbles are made.  4.            Start the twists on the side where the balloon was tied. Doing this will allow the air to be pushed near the end of the balloon.  5.            Keep in mind to always clean your hands before twisting to avoid the balloon to end up being sticky and dirty. Children must also be warned to stay away from balloons that are not inflated. Although the balloons are generally made with safe materials, it is pertinent that children must be supervised at all times to avoid choking and all the other hazards that could happen.  6.            As mentioned earlier, learn the different type of twists and forms which are generally available online and even through books. Some of these are: designing of locking twists, four legged animals and birds. You can also have the bubble roll through, the folded twist or the large ear twist. The other designs which a lot of people prefer include the apple twist, hook twist, s-twist, pop twist, banana twist and a whole lot more.  Since there’s so much we could do with a balloon, let me give the basic steps for a simple dog shape. We must first learn how to make a bubble because to create figures, making bubbles of different sizes must be produced to shape the desired form.  To make a dog, you will need to pinch the area where you would need to twist it. After the pinch of about 2 inches in length, you will need to make two more bubbles of equal size. Fold the twist between the second and third bubble. Secure this fold by twisting together the first bubble and the end of the third bubble. That makes the head of the dog.  Moving on, make a smaller bubble to form the neck and two more bubbles the same size as the ones made for the head. Again, fold the twist between the second and third bubble. After, twist and secure this by twisting the area after the neck and the last twist that was made. That made the front legs of the dog.  When this is done, create a longer bubble for the body of the dog then three more bubbles for the hind legs and the tail. Same procedure goes with creating the front legs. Once you are done, you have created the basic dog created at parties and fairs.  Learning is not difficult at all and I’m sure that when you were younger, you somewhat tried to form shapes with the balloons you able to get your hands on. With instructions posted everywhere, you don’t even have to think about what to do and how to do it.     The Business of Balloon Twisting  Some people would like to learn not only as a hobby but they would like to consider turning it into something profitable. Below is a short list of what needs to be done.  1.            Get a permit and license. Depending on what state you are at, there are different laws regarding this. Know what your state allows to avoid having any problems in the future.  2.            Figure out your over head. Make a list of your equipment costs, and don’t forget to include other things like gas for your car, mobile phone, accountant, insurance, computer, etc.  3.            Work out your taxes. You will have two: sales tax and income tax.  4.            Get insurance.  You may have difficulty with this as a lot of people don’t think of twisting balloons a job or that you made it a business. You can get a home owners/ renters insurance. Since it is a home-based job. It will not only cover you but even your equipment. Another thing you could look into is the World Clown Association (WCA). They are represented by a reputable insurance agent. It costs $100 and there is no deductible.  5.            Study on the laws regarding employing your children. You may be cited for breaking child labor laws even if your child just accompanies you and decides to help you by handing you a couple of balloons.  6.            Always bring at least 1 ½ bags of balloons per hour. It would even be better if you would bring two. Think of the assortment; colors and shapes. Don’t forget the while paper for the eyes, markers, scissors, pipe cleaners for whiskers, static guard for the static and nail cutters.  7.            Lastly, be careful of copyrights and trademarks. You could be sued if what you create has the slightest resemblance of a character.     The next step would be how to promote your business. One thing that I can think of is giving others balloon care cards. These have three purposes: it provides you customer information needed to care for the balloon, it gives them safety tips, and it will become a marketing tool. You do not need to purchase fancy cards and regular bond paper is fine.  If you are at a professional event, sneaking in the card between the balloons will do.  People often remove the paper and put it in their pockets.     Another idea is handing out flyers. Walk up to them and show them the brightly colored flyers. Be as creative as you want. Make sure that it stands out so people will take the time to read them.  Place newspaper ads.  There are freebie newspapers and those community papers. Your local church even has a paper that they hand out at the end of the mass to tell you about their monthly activities. At the very back of those, there are small advertisements. Don’t forget that you could also place ads on billboards of groceries and other locations. The important thing is you find every free solution you can or at least those that have minimal cost.  Sell yourself. Show them what you got and what makes you different from others. Prove to them that they need you. Expose yourself because the more people see you, the more they will get the idea that they would like to have you in their event. More often than not you will receive calls just checking how much they will spend when they hire you. What you need is great salesmanship. Not only do you twist balloons but you have a great personality that comes with it. Keep in mind that this potential job can give you five more jobs or more if others love your act.  Place yourself in the yellow pages and online classified ads which people nowadays use to look for anything. What is important is that you stand out, you expose yourself and others see the need to have you around. Remember that most of your business doesn’t come from all the methods I just mentioned but from referrals.     Where to Work – A Balloon Entertainers Guide  For indoors, you have restaurants, shopping malls, stores, wedding receptions, museums, company events, and movie theaters.  For the outdoors, you have zoos, parks, car washes, theme parks, the White House, graduations and your front porch. You must always have plenty of water and stay in the shade. Wear a hat or have a large umbrella. You can also provide a tent if the event pays you to bring one. You wouldn’t want to have heatstroke or other problems that come with being outside for a prolonged period of time. Most importantly, take breaks. You might get so caught up trying to advertise yourself that you forget to rest. If you become ill, it won’t be worth it.  Make sure to always have balloons handy anywhere you go. Even if you are out with friends and you see a table at the restaurant celebrating something, twist something up for them and as always, attach a business card. If you see a child crying, send one over to them and see the wonderful reaction of a child. Believe me, everyone will be pleased if you make that child stop.  Working As a Balloon Decorator  Should you decide to not get into the balloon twisting business and eventually would like to be selling (distributor) or printing balloons, it would also be a great way to earn money. Like any business, you need to spend a great amount of your time researching. Everything should be looked at and even the smallest detail should not be forgotten. Should it be home based or are you going to have a small office? What products will I have to start out with? Find out if you will able to profit in a certain location. Will you be getting into a partnership with someone else and how will we split the expenses as well as the earning?  Balloon art is lucrative as long as you find your niche and you are wise with your business. If this is just a hobby and you’re prepared to be paid with smiles, if could be just as rewarding. At the end of the day, what are important are the smiles of the people and the interaction with others. You have this amazing talent and making children happy and jump for joy could be payment enough.",
Off Road Driving,"Introduction to Off Road DrivingOff-Road Driving is essentially driving across terrain that is not a paved or tarmac road, using 4x4 vehicles. You do not have to be highly trained, particularly skilled or be qualified to have fun at this sport, but you do need to have at least a short course in Off-Road Driving to understand the basics about your vehicle, the terrain and aspects of the sport before you start.The definition for Off-Road Driving is driving a 4x4 vehicle on unpaved roads and natural terrain, i.e. sand, gravel, mud, rocks, etc.There are two types of off-roading which are very different from each other. Firstly, there is Off-Road Driving which is slower and covers challenging terrain. It can be carried out more or less anywhere and is much more accessible as many people have a 4x4 that is capable of at least the basic Off-Road Driving principles. Secondly, there is Off-Road Racing which is much faster and uses specialised vehicles. It is much more skilled, due to the speed over the rocky terrain, but an amazing thrill. History of Off-Road Driving Way before roads were built, people were effectively ‘off-roading’ when driving a horse and cart - only one, two, four or six horsepower though – because they travelled across rocky, sand, snow and difficult terrains. As the first motor vehicles were being invented and built, the building of roads caught up, and later these were the tracks that were travelled in order to reach your destination – they didn’t need to travel across difficult terrain anymore as roads provided a much smoother passage.However, as new areas of the globe were colonised, motor vehicles that could cope with difficult terrains were needed to traverse great areas of uneven and rocky ground before they could build the roads. So vehicles specifically designed to travel off-road were invented and manufactured.",
Kayak and Canoe,"Kayak and Canoe Information Introduction to Kayaks & Canoes There are literally millions of miles of water to paddle in the United States alone. “What are we doing this weekend?” will never be the same again. 

The recreational options offered by canoeing and kayaking are virtually endless. While the technology surrounding canoes and kayaks is constantly changing, the sport of canoeing and kayaking remains much the same as it was even thirty years ago. 

Regardless of which approach you take to canoeing and kayaking, make sure you enjoy yourself. Paddling is about the excitement and adventure associated with exploring the areas around you. Even if you enjoy paddling the most ferocious whitewater, take a moment to enjoy your surroundings. Who knows, you might see a bald eagle overhead or a moose by the river bank. 

Any sport that puts you in moving water has its hazards. Pay close attention to the safety suggestions offered in this guide and make sure you are prepared for every possible paddling scenario. 
Canoeing & Kayaking Canoes and kayaks are both a type of boat used without the power of a motor or sail. There is a little bit of a gray line between canoes and kayaks. However, for the purposes of this guide, canoeing and kayaking are differentiated by paddling techniques and equipment. 
History Throughout American history alone, the canoe and the kayak have provided transportation, athletic activity, and recreational opportunity. There will always be a place for these boats in the American culture. In fact, both canoes and kayaks are believed to hold their origins in ancient North American history.  
Canoes The canoe of today is surprisingly similar to the canoe of a thousand years ago. The design principles and paddling techniques remain very much the same. All that changes are the materials used to build each boat. While technology will continue to improve, the structure and purpose of the ancient canoe will no doubt carry on in even the most modern canoe.  
Kayaks Today, kayaks are far more popular than canoes. Their weight, maneuverability, and efficiency makes the kayak a ideal for even the novice paddler. The kayak was designed to function well in less than ideal conditions. Even though modern kayaks are used less for arctic hunting and more for recreation, the features found in the original kayaks translate well into the modern kayak. 
Types of Canoes & Kayaks Think of a place to paddle and chances are there is a canoe or kayak designed just for you. From fishing to paddling waterfalls, there are hundreds of varieties of canoes and kayaks. Rather than list them all, here are a few key distinguishing features and a list of the top three types of canoes and kayaks. 

• Whitewater: involves taking a kayak or canoe down rapids. • Sea: involves taking kayaks or canoes out on to the ocean or other open water. • Recreational: designed for the casual paddler interested in fishing, photography, or a peaceful paddle on a lake or flatwater stream. They presently make up the largest segment of canoe and kayak sales. Less expensive materials live polyethylene and fewer options keep these boats inexpensive (USD 300-580). They do not perform as well in the sea.  
Construction Materials Canoes and kayaks are made from many different materials. Some construction methods are traditional while others are at the forefront of technology. Pick the construction that best suits your needs. For example, a wooden canoe is better suited to bird watching than a noisy aluminum canoe. 

Strip-Built constructed by gluing together strips of wood over a building jig consisting of station molds that define the shape of the hull. 

Glued Plywood Lapstrake made by cutting planks to shape out of marine grade plywood. The planks are positioned on a building jig, and are glued together with epoxy at the laps along the length of the canoe. There are Aluminum Canoes (which are much lighter and much stronger construction than wood), There are also newer composites of fiberglass, Kevlar, and carbon fiber these materials are light, strong, and maneuverable. ABS canoes have been known to pop back into their original shape with minimal creasing even after having been wrapped around a rock in strong river currents. 
How To Choose A Canoe or Kayak When you decide to buy a canoe or kayak, there are lots of things to take into account. These questions are reasonably simple and can be answered in order to best determine which canoe or kayak will be best suited to your needs. 

1. Do you plan to canoe or kayak? 

2. What types of trips are you planning to make? 

The right boat will suit the needs of the trips you plan to make. If you are planning to fish on weekends, you will not need the durability and size of an expedition sized vessel. On the other hand, if you plan to paddle from beach to beach on the ocean, a vessel designed for flat river travel would be a bad idea. 

3. How many people will travel in each vessel? 

Solo canoes and kayaks are typically smaller and lighter than tandem or family vessels. A canoes can hold a family of four or five whereas a kayak will hold a maximum of two people. 
Preparing To Buy A Boat Once you determine your boat shopping criteria, you can begin to research the best boat for you. There are a few things to keep in mind as you begin shopping for your boat. 

• Know your prices. Online research of manufacturers websites will give you a general idea of the cost of a good canoe or kayak. Chances are, if a deal seems to good to be true, there is something wrong with the boat. 

• Ignore newspaper ads, these boats are generally junk. The same applies to handmade boats advertised in newspapers. Water sports are hazardous enough, why risk your life buying a less than perfect boat? Instead, find club sites or go to competitions to purchase well-loved, used boats. 

• Be aware of defects. On canoes, if the keel is damaged or the canoe is out of round, do not buy the boat. On canoes and kayaks, look for cracks, breaks, damage parts, and delamination. Do not buy a boat that has any of these problems. Scratches and scrapes are okay, just be aware of their presence. 
Canoe & Kayak Brand Recommendations Every year, a new canoe or kayak brand will launch. However, if these companies survive, they lack some of the construction and industry experience the industry leaders possess. The following brands are consistently well made, user friendly, and excellent for every experience level. 

Canoes 

Each canoe brand offers a variety of canoes made from different materials, in different sizes and shapes. Among the five brands listed below, there is a canoe for every person. 

• Old Town • Mad River • Pelican • Wenonah • Merrimack 

Kayaks 

There are well over fifty kayak brands on the market. However, not all of the brands make kayaks for multiple uses. The brands listed below offer a variety of kayaks made from a multitude of materials designed to suit different environments and techniques. 

Keep in mind that nearly one of every three kayaks sold today is a sit-on-top (SOT), which is basically a paddleboard equipped with a seat. 

• LiquidLogic • Perception • Dagger • Riot • Pyranha 
Essential Paddling Equipment As you begin your canoeing or kayaking adventures, there are several key pieces of equipment you will need in order to begin. The basic requirements for beginning canoeing and kayaking are similar. However, both sports have some key differences. 

For both paddle sports, you will need the appropriate boat. See the descriptions above for the types of canoes and kayaks available as well as the construction materials you can choose from.  
Paddles A paddle allows you to propel the boat through the water. When searching for the right paddle, take the following into consideration: 

• The type of vessel • The body of water you are to navigate • Your size 

A canoe paddle has a single blade at the end of a handled shaft. A kayak paddle has a blade on either end of the shaft. 

Paddles are constructed from wood, aluminum, and synthetic materials. The strongest, most durable paddles are made from carbon fiber. The most flexible paddles are constructed from wood. 

As a rule, a canoe paddle should measure from your toes to between your chin and your eyes. In general, solo paddles should be longer with a narrow blade. 

Kayak paddles are slightly more difficult to fit. To determine the best paddle for you, follow these steps. 

• Hold your arms straight out on either side of your torso. • Bend your forearms up at a ninety degree angle. • When you old a paddle in this position, the paddle blades should be within two grips of the blades. 

Try a few out for size. If the paddle is too short, you will waste energy paddling. If the paddle is too long, your movements will lose control and your body will not be in the correct position resulting in potential injury. 

Paddle costs will vary by material and size. If you are beginning, you don`t have to spend a fortune on a paddle. Make sure the paddle fits and is sufficiently durable for the type of paddling you expect to perform.  
Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs) A personal flotation device is an absolutely essential piece of equipment, regardless of which paddle sport you choose. The right PFD for you will depend on your size and the type of activity in which you will participate. 

For canoeing and kayaking, look for a Type II or Type III PFD. Type II PFDs are ideal for moving water as they force the wearer to float on their back. Type III PFDs do not force the wearer to float on their back but they do allow the wearer to float in an upright position. 

Within each type, PFDs are available with different levels of flotation. These levels include the typical 7lb, 11lb, 15 ½ lb, and 22lb weights. Your size and the type of water determine which level is best. The heavier, the higher the degree of flotation. 

As with canoes and kayaks, there are a multitude of PFD manufacturers. However, a few brands are exceptional in their comfort and durability. 

• Stohlquist • Kokotat • Patagonia • Astral Buoyancy • Extrasport 

The best PFD for you will have the following features: 

• Fully adjustable shoulder straps and chest straps • Comfortable arm openings and padding 

Before buying a PFD, try several on. Keep in mind that you will be wearing your PFD for extended periods of time. If part of the PFD rubs or feels uncomfortable in the store, imagine what it will feel like after eight hours in salt water.  
Other Equipment Helmets 

A helmet is the best way to protect your skull and brain from trauma if you are paddling in whitewater or fast moving water. A proper fitting helmet might save your life. Look for a helmet that covers the base of your skull. Finally, never buy a used helmet, no matter how good it looks. 

A good helmet should cost around $100 dollars or more. Cheap helmets compromise your safety. 

Clothing 

Hypothermia is common in paddlers who are inadequately dressed. Even if the air temperature is balmy, cool water temperatures can result in hypothermia within minutes. Proper dressing can prevent the likelihood of a swim resulting in hypothermia. 

When choosing your clothing, keep the following in mind: 

• Weather: Waterproof outer layers will protect you from the elements. The cooler the temperature, the more important these layers become. Look for Gore-Tex and other waterproof materials. • Warmth: Cotton clothing is dangerous in water. Synthetic materials like fleece stay warm and dry quickly. While wool and down do not dry quickly, the do hold warmth when wet. Neoprene is another great layer for warmth. • Core Temperature Maintenance: Moisture from exertion and splashes can cause your body temperature to rise or drop. Keep a wicking layer close to your body to prevent unwanted temperature changes. Silk and synthetic underlayers, particularly long underwear, keep your core temperature stable. Coolmax, Marmot, and Patagonia make excellent long underwear. 

Other clothes to bring include: 

• Hats serve as sun protection and keeps body heat in. • Gloves keep hands warm and prevent injuries to the hand. • Shoes and socks bare feet are targets for rusty cans, glass, and sharp rocks. The best shoes will have rubber soles for grip on wet surfaces. Choose shoes that are easy to get out of in an emergency. Teva, Keen, Merrel, and Chaco are all excellent water shoe brands. 

Navigation Equipment 

Unless you are planning to travel a short distance or are on a small lake, keep a map of your area and a compass in a waterproof bag or box. 

Safety Equipment 

It doesn`t matter how much fun you had on the water if you don`t make it back to shore. Keep the following on hand to deal with any emergency that may occur on your adventures. 

• Food and water are essential, regardless of the length of your trip. Dehydration and fatigue can result in fatal accidents. • Identification • Medication • First-aid kit • Whistle or emergency signal • Rescue throw rope • Sponge and bailer • Float plan leave a copy with a family member or friend and any authorities in your area. 

Recreational Equipment 

Record your adventure with a camera and a notebook. You never know when you will need to record your finds. Other great items to have around are binoculars and local wildlife guidebooks. 
Transporting Your Canoe or Kayak You need to get your vehicle to and from your destination. Don`t put your boat on top of an unprepared vehicle. If your vehicle does not have factory racks, purchase a rack system that is compatible with your vehicle. Thule makes excellent racks that can be customized to fit any vehicle and hold any type of equipment. 

Before you head off into the wild, practice loading and unloading your boat onto your rack. Secure each boat with individual ties. If the boat extends beyond the roof of the vehicle, secure the bow and stern to the front and back of the vehicle. 

When traveling, check the tightness of the ties every time you stop your vehicle and adjust as necessary. 
Where To Learn There are several schools that offer canoeing and kayaking lessons. If there are no locations in your area, ask your local pools for permission to practice. 

You can also practice in a shallow lake or pond until you are familiar with the techniques you need to stay safe. If you do decide to teach yourself to paddle, make sure there is someone present in case you have an emergency. 

Most canoe/kayak clubs offer introductory instruction in recreational boats. 

The best resource for lessons is your local college`s outdoor program. Even if these classes are not open to the public, the staff will have recommendations for places in your area where you can learn to paddle. 

Outing clubs often host paddling trips that are open to all experience levels and modes of transportation. This is an excellent way to learn from others in an outdoor setting. 
How To Paddle Canoes and kayaks have a reputation for instability, but this is not true if they are handled properly. For example, the occupants need to keep their center of gravity as low as possible. Canoes and kayaks can navigate swift-moving water with careful scouting of rapids. 

When two people occupy a canoe or kayak, they paddle on opposite sides. For example, the person in the bow might hold the paddle on the port side. The sternman would paddle to starboard. Paddle strokes take place simultaneously but on opposite sides.  
Canoe Paddle Strokes There are many different strokes but the seven listed below will help you turn in almost every direction. You can add strokes as you master the basics. 

Paddle strokes are important to learn if the canoe is to move through the water in a safe and effective manner. Categorizing strokes make learning them easier. After the strokes are mastered, they can be combined or modified so that maneuvers are accomplished in an efficient, effective, and skillful manner. Here are the primary strokes: 

The cruising stroke or forward stroke is the easiest stroke and is considered to be the foundation of all other strokes. The paddle blade is brought forward along the side of the canoe, dipped into the water, and drawn back. 

The back stroke is essentially the same movement as the forward stroke, but done in reverse. The back face of the blade is used in this case. This stroke is used to make the canoe go backward or stop the canoe. 

The J-stroke is so named because, when done on the port side, it resembles the letter J. It begins like a standard stroke, but towards the end the paddle is rotated and pushed away from the canoe with the power face of the paddle remaining the same throughout the stroke. This conveniently counteracts the natural tendency of the canoe to steer away from the side of the paddle. 

The pitch stroke is the preferred stroke to go straight with a good traveling speed, because this stroke tries to correct the yaw caused by the forward stroke almost on the same moment that it starts, where other correction strokes do this after the forward stroke, when there already is considerable yaw. 

The pry stroke begins with the paddle inserted vertically into the water, with the power face outward, and the shaft braced against the side of the gunwhale. A gentle prying motion is applied, forcing the canoe in the opposite direction of the paddling side. 

The draw stroke exerts a force opposite to that of the pry. The paddle is inserted vertically in the water at arm`s length from the gunwhale, with the power face toward the canoe, and is then pulled inward to the paddler`s hip. 
Safety Precautions Follow these rules and guidelines to stay safe and healthy while on the water. 

• If you get hurt, do not panic. • Stay hydrated. • Dress appropriately. • Pay attention to your surroundings. Weather, dams, rocks and strainers (trees and debris blocking your path through the water) all pose threats to your safety. • Learn to read water and scout any unknown rapids. • Learn First Aid • Don`t travel alone. • Wear a PFD at all times. Wear a helmet if you are paddling whitewater.",
Parrots,"Parrots Information  Introduction Throughout all pet hobbies, there is perhaps none more rewarding as keeping parrots as pets. For the right owners, a parrot can be extremely rewarding due to their high intelligence and strong desire to interact and bond with people. Many parrots are very affectionate, even cuddly with trusted people, but require a lot of attention from their owners. Some species have a tendency to bond to one or two people, and dislike strangers, unless they are regularly and consistently handled by different people. Properly socialized parrots can be friendly, outgoing, and confident companions, and since larger parrots can live 40-60 years, it is good to have a well socialized bird. The first thing people think about when they hear the word “parrot” is the large parrots known as Amazons,Macaws, or African Greys. This is of course a correct assumption, but for our purposes, the term “parrot” is being used to talk generally about pet store birds of the parrot family that includes Amazons, African Greys, Cockatoos, Eclectus, Hawk-headed Parrots, and Macaws; mid-sized birds such as Caiques, Conures, Quakers, Pionus, Poicephalus, Rose-ringed parakeets, and Rosellas, and many of the smaller types including Brotogeris, Budgies, Cockatiels, Parakeets, Lovebirds, Parrotlets and Lineolated Parakeets. 

The main thing that has attracted people to these fantastic birds over the years is their high level intelligence that has allowed them to learn tricks, something often reserved for only dogs, and the ability speak human language, even if it is nothing more that mimicking the sounds that they hear. Most pet parrots take readily to trick training, which is a helpful activity that can also help to redirect a bird`s energy and prevent or correct many behavior problems. Although parrots can be messy pets, with their frequent food throwing and damaging furniture with their beaks, they ae generally well behaved if given a substantial amount of room, a large selection of toys, and a lot of personal attention. With a lot of work, and an equal amount of research of the species, the parrot can prove to be one of the best animals on the market right now. 
What is a Parrot? Parrots, also known as psittacines (pronounced, are birds of the roughly 372 species in 86 genera that make up the order Psittaciformes, found in most warm and tropical regions. 
Choosing a Parrot The first rule about purchasing your first parrot is to buy a species that is interesting to you. Never be persuaded to purchase an animal that you don’t want because you are told it is an easier parrot meant for a beginner. If it is a parrot that you don’t really want, then it is a bird that you will grow tired of in the future. Regardless of what type it is that you want, you have to ensure you do all the research about it prior to purchasing it so that you take proper care of your new pet from day one. There is simply no sense in getting a parrot that will live for 60 years if you are not willing to take care of it for its entire life. Many of the larger parrots are unsuitable in an apartment setting due to noise level. Although all parrots will make some noise, species that are generally less noisy include parrotlets, budgies, cockatiels, Pyrrhura conures, Pionus, caiques, African Greys, and usually Poicephalus. Many of the other species of conures can be loud birds. Cockatoos, and many Macaws and Amazon parrots can be very loud, though normally only at certain times of the day. Care should be taken to ensure a parrot does not learn to scream for attention, and they should be punished if they do. 

One of the most debated issues in all of the pet industry is whether to purchase from a private breeder or from a pet store. Here is an argument that is based on a few too many bad apples spoiling it for the bunch. Without pet stores, there simply would not be parrots, small animals, reptiles, snake, and amphibians in captivity as pets because it was various pet stores that sparked the interest in exotic animals in the first place. But over the past twenty years, there have been numerous cases of birds being sold by people thinking only of profit as their animals suffer from neglect. Thankfully, there has been numerous bird enthusiasts stepping forward to challenge pet stores to live up to the standards that exotic birds require, and there have also been numerous pet stores in North America that have been promoting proper animal care. The downside to purchasing from a pet store is that you will be paying higher prices because the pet store purchases from breeders and then mark up the prices to make a profit. Sometimes you will find unique birds in pet stores, but for the most time, they are usually the run of the mill whereas, if you purchase from a breeder, you may be able to get a more unique animals that most people have never seen before. 

As a general rule of thumb, always try to purchase the healthiest parrot available. This is easily done by purchasing the largest in a group that has bright eyes, has beautiful plumage, and is active. Larger animals typically mean that they are being well fed and cared for. If a parrot is skinny and not active, then it is best to leave it be. One of the most common reasons for buying a small sickly animal from either a breeder or pet store is because you want to save it and nurse it back to health. Although noble your intentions might be, a life time of health issues will not make you love your new pet any more, and health issues in parrots are incredibly difficult to treat especially if it is young and has yet to build up a resistance to illnesses. A healthy animal can live many years, and if you put in the time that is necessary, you will be rewarded in the long run. The other thing that is unique to the parrot over all other animals is that young teens and some idiot adults like to teach these birds obscene language while they are in the pet store. With a lot of work and positive reinforcement, they might forget or stop using these words, but it is often best to avoid birds that have taught negative things. 

While many parrot species do well with equally well behaved children, and can be trained to become excellent family pets, they are generally not a good child`s pet due to their potential lifespan and specific care care required. Parrots are not a pet that can simply be ignored for any amount of time, and they require consistent daily care and attention. They are also longer lived than most other companion animals in which their lifespan range from around 15 years for a budgie or lovebird, to 20–30 years for a cockatiel, and up to 80 to 100 years for Amazons and Macaws. Additionally, a young child could unintentionally injure a small bird such as a budgie, and most parrots unaccustomed to children may find the high energy level and noise of a young child threatening. Parrots that have been raised and socialized around children from a young age typically do much better with children than parrots who are introduced to children at a later age. This is just one of many things to work out prior to picking up a parrot that will spend a life time together with you. 
Required Equipment The initial purchase for your new parrot, be it a Budgie or an Amazon, is a cage. It is very important for your parrot to have a cage large enough to exercise, especially if it will not be out for a good part of the day. Since parrots love to stretch their wings and are generally quite active, so you must ensure that you have a cage big enough that your bird can play in, climb around in, and stretch its wings. Without exercise, your bird will tend to become obese and unhealthy quite quickly. With the right home parrots have the potential to make excellent, highly interactive, affectionate, and entertaining pets prized by their owners, but should not be considered easy care or low maintenance pets in any way. Since parrots use their hooked beaks to help them to climb around, somewhat like an arm to aid in their climbing, and also as a tool to shell seeds and nuts. It is of the upmost importance to have a cage that is of a strong, sturdy build otherwise a parrot could tear the cage apart. 

For most animals, toys are just a nice addition to ensure pets will have fun and perhaps have their minds challenges, but for parrots, toys are an absolute necessity. Like any pet, different birds will have different birds will have different preferences for toys, but you have to remember that toys should be sized appropriately for the bird`s size and destructiveness. For example, a small plastic budgie toy could be dangerous for a large parrot that could break off and ingest a piece without any trouble at all. The key to finding toys that a bird will enjoy is to always ensure you have a large selection of toys, of all sorts of varieties, that will both entertain them and challenge their intelligence. Some birds may prefer wooden toys to chew up; some may prefer bells or other toys that make noise; some may prefer toys with leather strips they can untie; some may prefer a bowl of small `foot toys` they can throw around. There is little risk of small birds like budgies and love birds, but with larger birds, like macaws, amazons, and African Greys, there is a high risk that lack of toys will lead to boredom, which will lead to a destructive outburst. 
Conclusion Throughout the pet industry, there is perhaps no other animal that has garnered as much fame at that of the parrot. The simple fact is that they have beautiful colours, are extremely personable, and highly intelligent, but the one thing that makes them so popular is their ability to speak. A lot of the times their speech is nothing more than their attempt to mimic their owners, but when they start using certain word in context, their brilliants truly stand out. Not only are they great pets, but they make a fascinating hobby as you can spend countless hours with them, and they will never get tired of trying to learn new things. Perhaps the one thing that does cause peoples is their incredibly long life spans. Prior to owning a parrot, most people have most likely only owned pets that have live to a maximum of 15 years, but some larger parrots live to be 60 -80 years old. So what happens if your parrot actually out lives you? It’s a pretty strange question, but it is something you have to figure out prior to making a big purchase that will take up a large portion of your life. There is perhaps no hobby more fascinating than the one that can actually talk back to you.",
Candle Making,"Candle Making Information  Intro Candle Making is one the most popular hobbies that can help you feel relaxed after a long day at work. More than a hobby, candle making has become an art form. Individuals have their own designs and ideas for candles and in this case, no matter what design is created, it becomes a work of art, at least to the creator. Candle making is not a very difficult task; however, you would certainly like to create something that could be made a focal point in your room. The best thing about this hobby is that in case your design is not good, you can melt the candle and make one all over again. 
Basic requirements for making candles: Before you start making candles there are few basic materials that you must gather. Candle moulds are the most important requirement for making candles. You can buy these moulds from any craft shop. Paraffin wax is another basic requirement, available in the form of granules or blocks. You also need to buy stearin, which is a material added to melted wax so that the candles you make turn out to be opaque, hard and long burning. If you are using 450 grams of wax then the usual proportion of stearin would be 3 tablespoons. If you are using dyes then first you will have to dissolve it in stearin and then add it to the melted wax mixture. Paraffin wax can be made longer burning if you add small amount of beeswax to it. Some of the other materials you need are: 

• Votive wicks • Silicone spray if using metal votive moulds • Any old saucepan for creating a double boiler • Oven mitts   You can cover the burners with aluminum foil and spread a newspaper or old rag on a flat working area so that it is easy to clean up after work. 
Pursuing candle making as a hobby: Candle making will not only help you relax but once you see the result it will also give you tremendous creative satisfaction. In case you are very good at it, you can even consider starting a home based candle-making business and earn some extra bucks. This hobby can be a very enjoyable experience for anyone. Since it is easy and safe, you can even ask your kids to help you in the whole process. It can be a great way of spending quality time with them but don’t forget to supervise their activities. Make sure that when you are working around open flame, equipment for avoiding any potential dangerous situation is there in your house. Even though candle making is creative and fun, you will have to give it your undivided attention. When you work with hot wax, don’t try multitasking because it will not only be dangerous but the wax will also turn cold very fast.   Candle making kits can be of great help to you in pursuing this hobby. These kits are perfect for beginners to introduce themselves to the art of candle making. Once you are aware of the basic know how of candle making, this kit will show you the basic techniques and steps that can help you create stunning candles. 
Important things to remember: Protection of the work surface from melted wax is the most important step in candle making. You can use a heavy plastic or newspaper to spread on a flat surface. No elaborate tools are required for creating beautiful candles. If you cannot spend on expensive fancy equipment, then a thermometer and roasting pan would also do.   Safety is an essential aspect of this hobby. Wax melting is a relatively easy process but still you will have to be very careful while doing it. Don’t let your children get close to it or touch it. Fragrances and dyes can be found in craft stores. Remember to add the dye in the melted wax very slowly so that it gets completely dissolved. Always add colors one at a time so that you get to see which one is working best with the other.   You must watch the wax very carefully while it melts because in case of extra heat, it can burn. In case it starts to smoke, remove it from the burner quickly but don’t let it spill on you. Even if it happens, don’t wipe but run it under cold water so that it hardens and falls. 
Adding personality to your hobby: In candle making, the most creative part is to choose the right kind of candle pattern. You can also add a splash of color; melt your favorite crayon color so that a vibrant look could be given to your candle. From non-flammable beads to stencils, anything can be used for creating a stunning work of art. The only limitation you have is your imagination. If you want scented candles then add some crushed herbs so that it gets a pleasant scent whenever you light it. So what are you waiting for? If you have always been interested in making candles then candle-making kits could be of great help to you.",
Play Writing,"Play Writing Information  Introduction Whilst Playwriting may sound like it is an easy hobby, it is more complicated than it looks. There are many techniques to writing, and a variety of formats to master. It also helps to have an idea of how a stage production works, i.e. how long or wide the stage is, or how long it takes to move from one area to another. 

However, if you have a creative mind or a great idea, it is an inexpensive hobby to have and can be very rewarding. If you want to learn how to write a play, there are a range of courses and workshops available to help you, or you could join your local theatre club to gain a valuable understanding of how to produce a play; getting to know actors, directors, producers, and other members can be very beneficial and a great asset for your playwriting hobby. They will be a useful source for information, as well as constructive critiques of your work. 
Techniques and Style of Playwriting There are some simple steps you can follow to make the process of writing your play easier. Start by getting to know your characters; how old are they, their occupations, their relationship to other characters, are they happy or sad, driven or melodramatic. You can do a list of the characters, a ‘Cast of Characters’, which can help the actors get to know their parts. Set the scene; decide where your play will take place, what time of the year, over what period of time, what items are needed on the stage – all this information helps actors, directors and producers in producing your play. Don’t forget to include entrances and exits, any physical actions that need to be performed, any significant pauses in dialogue, but you needn’t include detailed descriptions of costumes or set backgrounds, or even tone/delivery hints for actors. 

The plot structure is similar to that of writing an essay; it needs a beginning, middle and end. The introduction, or ‘Exposition’, introduces the audience to the scene, the characters and context of the play, but you don’t have to introduce all of this at the beginning, i.e. additional characters can be added later. Next is to tell the audience what started the principal plot of the play, i.e. what is the catalyst that starts the action? Then build on it, introducing characters if necessary and expanding on the plot. This is known as the ‘Rising Action’. The ‘Climax’ is the audience gasping moment, the moment the action reaches its crescendo, i.e. people/love/fortunes lost. Following this is the confrontation and resolution of the Climax, or ‘Falling Action’, and it can also include turning points, accepting or rejecting the results of confrontation, and any actions accordingly taken. The final part of the plot is the resolution, or ‘Denouement’, giving the audience the answers; is it a happy ending or a sad ending? 

Think about how your characters interact with each other; there are three elements that make up character interaction, known as ‘Dramatic Action’ and they are: 

1. Discovery – the character makes a startling discovery; how does this change his life or what he believes? What is he going to do about it? 

2. Revelation – an admission by a character, i.e. they’ve witnessed a murder. 

3. Decision – the character’s action as a result of discovery and/or revelation. 

Your scenes or ‘Acts’ can incorporate all or some of these elements as the play progresses, and the character elements can interact with and affect another character’s discovery, revelation or decision. 

There is a basic format to follow when writing a play:   Top line centred: TITLE of PLAY   2nd line centred: AUTHOR(s)   Characters 

Name #1: a short description of the character, name of the actor playing the part. 

Name #2: etc. 

Setting 

A short description of the location and time period of the scene. 

(Then set out stage directions to inform the actors and director what the audience should see when the curtain goes up. Also note any actions/movements prior to dialogue commencing, and try to make it from the actor’s point of view, i.e. what is the character doing?) 

NAME: (this format is for each character, i.e. JONATHAN:). Set out the dialogue. You don’t need to use speech marks and all dialogue lines are indented. If you are including any specific instructions, i.e. any actions while the actor is talking, they need to be written in italics and placed in brackets, i.e. (fills a glass with water from the kitchen sink tap.) 

To help you with formatting, there are a range of writing software tools which you can purchase (supplied on disk or downloadable from the internet), such as Final Draft. You can also download from the internet, scriptwriting software that incorporates much of the planning, storyboarding and outline tools, such as Celtex. Also available are web-based software tools, i.e. you don’t need to download it to use the software. These software tools are accessible from any location that has an internet connection, saves time, and is easy to use, but you do need an internet connection! 

There are a variety of styles, or ‘genres’, that you can use for your play. The basic genres are comedy, satire, mystery, historical, farce and tragedy, and from these you can develop a whole myriad of variations, i.e. a black comedy, a political satire, a comical farce, etc. 

Comedy 

Comedies are plays which are designed to be humorous. Comedies are often filled with witty remarks, unusual characters, and strange circumstances. Certain comedies are geared toward different age groups. Comedies were one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece, along with tragedies. 

Farce 

A generally nonsensical genre of play, farces are often overacted and often involve slapstick humour. 

Satirical 

A satire is a play which takes a comic look at current events and famous people while at the same time attempting to make a political or social statement, for example pointing out governmental corruption. 

Tragedy 

These plays often involve death and are designed to cause the reader or viewer to feel sadness. Tragic plays convey all emotions, and have extremely dramatic conflicts. Tragedy was one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece. 

Historical 

These plays focus on actual historical events. They can be tragedies or comedies, but are often neither of these. History as a separate genre was popularised by William Shakespeare. 
Resources and Equipment Playwriting is not an expensive past-time, you can start with just a pen or pencil, and paper, although you might get writer’s cramp! Most people nowadays have access to a computer, which makes writing a lot quicker and easier with a range of tools, i.e. spell checker and thesaurus, to help with spelling, punctuation, words, etc. You can also save your work safely, and back up on a disc, hard drive or USB stick. 

You may wish to invest in a writing software package which can be purchased for around $150-$200, or a web-based package which may charge a monthly fee. As previously mentioned, there are free of charge, downloadable writing software packages available, i.e. Celtex, but most of these don’t have as many tools as the purchased or web-based packages. 

If you wish to join a theatre group to learn more about how a theatre works, and how to stage a production as well as making valuable contacts, there will be a monthly or annual membership fee, but it would be well worth it. You may also want to got and watch some plays of different genre to get an idea of what genre you wish to use and a ‘feel’ of the audience’s point of view. This will involve purchasing tickets which will range in value from $10 upwards, depending on the play and where it is being performed. 
Where to Learn There are a variety of workshops, courses and seminars you can attend where you can learn more about playwriting; the format, scripting, genres, style and techniques. These can be sourced from most theatres and via the internet, but there will be a fee to attend. 
Promoting Your Play So, you’ve written your play and want to promote or sell it for production. This can be quite daunting and where do you start? The Writers Guild is a great source of potential outlets. You can register with them for a small $20 fee, which will also help you to protect your work. 

Before you promote your play, make sure you’ve gone through it in detail (you will probably have gone through several re-writes!). Use your contacts, friends, family, etc and ask for their feedback. They may see repeats or mistakes that you have missed. If you are looking for professional feedback, check out the Writers Store. Their professionals will offer you Development Notes on your play/script. 

Once you’re revisions and/or re-writes have been completed, there are many places where you can submit your script, or you can organise a reading, or enter a competition! Festivals take place worldwide, such as the Bay Area Playwrights Festival, The Blank 

Theater Company’s Young Playwright Festival (for people under 19 years of age), and the Comica: London International Comics Festival. Also, check out the Warner Bros. Writers Workshop. 

A popular annual competition for play writers is run by Bottle Tree Productions. It is for a One Act Play and closes in November. There is an entry fee of $25 per script you submit or, if you are just looking for critique, there is a $50 fee per script. You can also submit a script for both critique and entry, for which there is a fee of $75. 
Tips and Recommendations 1. Before your start writing, decide on the plot, genre and setting. 

2. Don’t worry about a title to start with. 

3. Write a shortened version first and ask for feedback from friends and family. This will help you to decide whether to go ahead and write the full script, or throw that idea away and try another one. 

4. Make sure you proof read your script. It is a good idea to have a professional proof reader to cast an eye over it. 

5. Don’t forget to include your dramatic moments, i.e. happy, sad, funny, slapstick, punchlines, emotions. Your dramatic moment could also be the conclusion or end. 

6. Try to limit it to two main characters only, and only one principal villain, although he can assistants! 

7. Read it through, and again, and again. It is also helps if you know an actor who can read it through and offer advice. 

8. Now you can start thinking about a title. It can be witty, explains the basic plot or doesn’t, or just relates to the play. 

9. Don’t worry if you can’t get all the characters sorted at the beginning. Most of the time, characters develop as you write the play. 

10. Don’t worry about names in terms of rhyming or linking, it really doesn’t matter. 

11. As you write, picture the scenes in your mind. 

12. Try to avoid using too many of the actors in one scene, but don’t use one actor in just one scene – they don’t like it! 

13. Avoid gun battles, and if there is a gunshot, restrict to only one or two scenes. 

14. Avoid quick scene changes and give the crew time – some set pieces are heavy and hard to move around! 

15. Be careful what you write, avoid offence to actor or audience (no racist or religious comments/jokes, keep children’s dialogue simple, avoid swear words unless necessary, and avoid sexist comments/jokes). Try not to make the character too nasty or bad – otherwise you might not be able to get an actor to play the part! 

16. Make sure you have enough characters – very, very few plays get away with less than 4 parts. 

17. Finally, enjoy the experience – this is a hobby!",
Waltz,"Waltz Information  What is the Waltz? This is a form of Bavarian folk dance that became famous in the European countries, sometime in the 18th Century. It is known as the ‘backbone’ of all modern ballroom dancing and hence is a very well known form of dance all over the globe. Unlike other forms of active dance like the jive, it is a continual dance pattern that makes you move across the floor. The highlights of the Waltz are the sudden turning and posture of the figure, which is totally graceful and eloquent. Much of the waltz music and tunes come from melodies created by the peasants. The word ‘Waltz’ is derived from the German word called ‘Walzen’ which literally means to glide, turn or roll. Which is exactly what you do when you Waltz. It was always a very important part of the political scenario and balls held by famous people like Napoleon Bonaparte. Initially it was not seen as a respectable dance, but later through the years it gained popularity as an ‘artistic’ dance. 
It was originally………… Initially it was a fast paced and exciting form dance which required a lot of stamina. And to add to that even the footwork was so methodical that you had to learn it. So people who didn’t know the steps were advised against dancing it. The original dance would contain only turns or a change in the steps but today’s International version is different. For example, the side sways and underarm turns are all a part of the new age waltz. The ‘slow’ waltz that the English know, is still actually a new version of the active dance that still forms a part of France or Germany. And I must say, is not slow at all. From the dance that it was over 200 years ago, the waltz is finally a slow paced dance, that literally ‘sweeps you off your feet’. 
Do you want to learn? It is not at all difficult to learn and is quite easy in fact. It has a simple and rhythmic pattern which blends with the music. The movements are smooth. Initially, the first Waltz consisted of a step forward or maybe backward, a step to your side and lastly, a step to bring your feet together. It is about perfect timing between all three steps and the rhythm of the music playing. Later on, it developed into a slower style, which was known as the ‘Boston waltz’. And today we have the International or American version, which is even slower and danced with much hesitation. Just one step to three beats. The slower the pace gets, the more you relish it. 

Think about the waves when you are about to start. It is similar to them in the movements of sway, rise and fall. Every step you take should be smooth as silk and confident like a cat. For beginners, you have to be smooth in your movements and not at all abrupt and intense. It is a romantic rendezvous, and is symbolic of love with its long sweeping movements across the floor. It must be graceful and gradual, and that is when you get it right. You should never make any sudden movements or drops. But ensure that you start at the toe and very gently drop slow and steady to the heel. Your body should be movable, as a waltz demands that you snake across the floor, and never dance in a straight line.   
What does it truly represent? Grace, beauty and pride. Even in a dance competition, the judges tend to look at the poise and lift of the head. The waltz is symbolic of all that is beautiful. In the time that it became famous in Boston as a ballroom dance, it was slated as being a dance for the rich and famous, polished and perfect. It is such a combination of music and dance that it is really one of the most outstanding dance. A perfect blend of art that leaves you feeling light and elevated.   
Are you dressed right? The outfit is definitely a part of the whole make up. The exquisite formal gowns or the crisp tuxedos are all a very crucial part of the Waltz scenario. You can never dream of being in casuals and Waltz. The two do not suit each other. It is a formal affair and best done in the right kind of attire. Do you know you must have the appropriate shoes too? Yes. Women normally opt for stilettos as they get a lot of balance and sway because it is high. Never ever wear flats. You just won’t be able to flow. Men on the other hand, stay away from rubber soles. Nowadays you do get special ‘dancing’ shoes which are Teflon coated. This is necessary as the right amount of friction between shoes and floor is what gives you a lift. The below links should help you get more information on the same.   
The right kind of music………. We all know that music is an extension of our soul. And combined with the Waltz, it becomes an extension of our personalities, and what we really are. You need the right kind of music to get that ‘feel’. Waltz is truly enjoyed with the right kind of ‘beat’. Opt for the music that makes you feel free and light, when you dance the Waltz. A good combination of both could actually make you feel as if you are flying. Famous musicians like Fred Astaire and Johann Strauss are people whose music makes you dance the waltz. 
Practice often…….. Finally, it is only by practice that you can become a great ‘Waltzer’. Have a few parties, or just feel free to dance at home. But the more you keep at it, the more refined will be your steps and movements. Just ‘fly away’ and don’t let anything stop you. Set yourself free from all inhibitions and let the music take control. You need to just imagine you are flying, and that is exactly what a Waltz can do to you, mentally. Dance away to the feel of the wind, my friend……………..",
Cardio Workout,"Cardio Workout Information  Introduction Not only is cardio a great hobby to be involved in, but it is perhaps the most important part of all other hobbies that involve any type of physical activity. Just the concept of being “in shape” is a term that is completely useless without the idea of developing cardio. Cardio is short for cardiovascular, which refers to the heart. Cardiovascular exercise is a type of exercise that raises your heart rate and keeps it elevated for a certain period of time. Another name for this is aerobic exercise. The kinds of exercise that are associated with cardiovascular workouts are things like jogging, speed walking, and swimming because they are all exercises where there is no break in the routine. Exercises that emphasize stretch and strength, like Pilates or yoga for example are generally not considered cardio exercise, though Pilates can be done in a cardio way, and can certainly be combined with cardio workouts to great effect. Cardio is so popular because there is a hefty list of health benefits associated with doing cardio exercises. Some of the top reasons to include cardio in your workout routine are that it strengthens the heart; it strengthens the lungs and increases lung capacity; It boosts the metabolism, burns calories, and helps you lose weight; it helps reduce stress; it increases energy; and it promotes restful sleep. So not only is cardio a great workout, it is also extremely beneficial to a healthy lifestyle, plus it is essential to any activity that requires physical activity. 
Types of Cardio Finding the right type of Cardio exercise is perhaps one of the best parts about getting into the Cardio hobby because there are just so many options to choose from. The problem with this fact is that you will have a hundred people telling you that there are a hundred “best” ways of working out your cardiovascular when in fact there may only be one “best” way for you. The fact is that any activity that you take part in should be fun and interesting to you, otherwise you will give up before you really give it a chance. Of the infinite different workouts available or practiced right now, I’ve attempted to narrow the list of the most common so you can get a tate for what is actually out there across the North America. 

Running is the most common kind of cardio exercise that is widely used across the world to promote a healthy cardiovascular. It is enjoyed by people of all age, especially by youngsters, and is accessible to anyone that is willing to give it a shot. Running can take place indoors on a treadmill or in the outdoors, as there is a lot of research that shows that running in fresh air helps to rejuvenate as well as burn calories. Walking is another effective cardio vascular exercise. Half an hour of normal walking can burn about 180 calories. Apart from this, if you like brisk walking, your speed of weight loss will be almost doubled. Like running, it is easy and requires no surplus preparation. Bicycling is another kind of aerobic or cardio exercise that helps in losing oodles of weight. It also magically works on your cardiovascular fitness. Performing it as indoor or outdoor activity entirely depends upon an individual`s choice, but I always prefer the outdoors in order to get fresh air. 

Swimming is easily on of the best forms of cardio exercise in summers outdoors and winters indoors. Not only does it help in overall weight and balanced weight loss, but it also provides total support to your joints and reduces the risk of any kind of injury. Rowing is another exercise that can be performed indoors at most gyms on a rowing machine, though at a glance this machine looks complicated in the corner of gym. However, rowing is one of the most effective cardio exercises as it helps in losing about 300 calories in half an hour if done with vigor. Rowing is also a completely different hobby you can take part in if you live near a lake or a marina that has a rowing club that offers rowing lessons.   In a typical gym, there will be numerous aerobic classes offered on a day to day basis, but step aerobics is one of the most popular cardio exercises found in gyms. It basically aims on the workout of the legs, hips and butt. It can make you lose 400 calories in half an hour if done with intensity, which is fantastic if you are interested in losing weight. Another type of exercise, which is a standalone hobby like Rowing, is Rock Climbing. Simply put, Rock Climbing is a wonderful cardio exercise and it can help you lose about 380 calories in half an hour, but is meant only for those who are well trained in this art. 
Warm Up/Cool Down When doing cardio work, it is always a good idea to ease yourself into your workout by doing a simply warm-up that will make the actually workout much more effective. A warm-up simply means 5 to 15 minutes of aerobic exercise at a very easy pace. But what exactly does warming up do for you? A warm-up literally warms you up meaning that it increases the temperature in your muscles and in the tissues that connect muscle to bone (tendons) and bone to bone (ligaments). Warmer muscles and joints are more pliable and, therefore, less likely to tear. In other words, a warm-up prevents injuries. Warming up also helps redirect your blood flow from places such as your stomach and spleen to the muscles that you’re using to exercise. This blood flow gives you more stamina by providing your muscles with more nutrients and oxygen. In other words, you tire more quickly if you don’t warm up. Lastly, warming up allows your heart rate to increase at a safe, gradual pace. If you don’t warm up, your heart rate will shoot up too quickly, and you’ll feel like you’re walking through a knee-high snowdrift. Should this happen, you are more likely to quite too early to get an actual benefit from your workout. People who are more out of shape need to warm up the longest because their bodies take longer to get into the exercise groove since their muscles aren’t used to working hard. If you’re a beginner, any exercise is high-intensity exercise, but as you get more fit, your body adapts and becomes more efficient, thereby warming up more quickly. Many people skip their warm-up because they’re in a hurry because it seems like a less effective use of their time. With the risks associated with not warming up before your cardio workout, it is a far better idea to add an extra 15 minutes to you entire workout, plus you will have a lot more fun. 

Just like the warm up aspect of a great cardio workout, the cool down portion of your workout is just as important, but also skipped far too often. After a cardio workout, you should always remember to cool down before resting, which means that you shouldn’t stop suddenly and make a dash for the shower or plop on the couch. You have to ease out of your workout just as you eased into it during a warm-up via walking, jogging, or cycling lightly. The purpose of the cool down is the reverse of what you accomplished during the warm-up. At this point, your heart is jumping, and blood is pumping furiously through your muscles to ensure proper oxygenation. You want your body to redirect the blood flow back to normal before you rush on with the rest of your day. You also want your body temperature to decrease before you hop into a hot or cold shower; otherwise, you risk fainting. Cooling down essentially prevents your blood from pooling in one place, such as your legs by returning your blood flow to normal. When you suddenly stop exercising, your blood can quickly collect, which can lead to dizziness, nausea, and fainting. If you’re really out of shape or at high risk for heart disease, skipping a cool down can place undue stress on your heart. The risks of not doing a 15 minute cool down at the end of your workout is not worth the health issues that will result from the loss of fifteen minutes of you day. Take your time, warm-up/cool down, and have fun. 
Monitoring Your Heart Rate Monitoring your heart rate during cardio exercises is the only way you can truly guarantee you are getting a great workout. When you first get into doing cardio work, it is often the case that you do not know how hard to push yourself to get the workout you need. The fact is that when you are a beginner, your heart has to work a lot harder to keep up with your body’s demands for blood and oxygen. If you work out on a regular basis, your aerobic system gradually becomes more efficient and you may need to step up the difficulty of your workout. Monitoring your resting heart rate should be your starting point in order to see what you normal heart rate is versus your exercise heart rate. Your resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute when you’re just sitting around. When you start exercising, your resting heart rate may be as high as 90. But after a few months of exercising, your resting heart rate may drop 10 or 20 beats per minute. 

Taking your pulse manually can be wildly inaccurate, so you have to concentrate when you do it. The simplest place to take your own pulse is at your wrist, but many people also find it easy to take their pulse on their own neck. Rest your middle and index fingertips (not your thumb as it also has a pulse) lightly on your opposite wrist, directly below the base of your thumb. Most people can see the faint bluish line of their radial artery, which is exactly where you want to place it. Count the beats for 1 minute. Or, if you have a short attention span like me, count for 30 seconds and multiply by 2. During your workout, take your pulse about every 15 minutes and be sure to concentrate, which can be quite difficult when working on a machine or in a class. You may want to slow down or even stop while you take your pulse, which is quite disruptive to your workout, but it’s not nearly as disruptive as flying off a treadmill. 

The other option for measuring your heart rate is to purchase an electronic heart-rate monitor so that you don’t need to stop exercising or take the time to count anything to check you r heart rate. At any given moment you can find out your heart rate by glancing at your wrist. A good monitor offers features such as a clock, a timer, and an alarm that you can set to beep when you wander out of your target zone. Thanks to modern technology, most cardio equipment in gyms these days have built in heart rate monitors that will automatically keep track of your target zones, heart rates, and all your other stats plus show them all to you on the monitor while you are working out. This makes a more effective workout, and it will save you some money in the process. 
Conclusion While it may not be the most fun when you first start the hobby, as you’re cardiovascular develops, you will find that the activity has tremendous benefits that are spread throughout one’s life. In a nutshell, a great cardiovascular workout will strengthen the heart and lungs, plus it increases lung capacity. It should also be noted that smokers will not have too much fun with this type of hobby because smoking destroys your cardiovascular system by inhaling tobacco smoke. A quick workout may force you into considering to quite for good. These workouts also boost your metabolism, burns calories, and help you lose weight, which is generally the purpose behind taking up this hobby. Aerobic exercise helps reduce stress by burring off unwanted energy, and it promotes restful sleep. The fact is that a healthy life will always incorporate at least some cardio workouts in their day to day life. It is this that children are lack during their day to day lives these days because it is far more common to see a young kid in front of a video game than actually outside doing things. The nice thing is that all the new counsels have new games that force people off of the couch in order to play their precious video games. Most systems actually have workout software that is achieving promoting a healthy lifestyle. The fact remains that the best way to get healthy, lose weight, and tone your muscles is to participate in daily cardio workouts.",
Shooting Sports,"Shooting Sports Information  Introduction The shooting sports include those competitive sports involving tests of proficiency (accuracy and speed) using various types of guns such as firearms. Hunting is also a shooting sport, and indeed shooting live pigeons was an Olympic event (albeit only once, in 1900). The shooting sports are categorized by the type of firearm or target used. 

Whether you are young or an adult who has decided to learn the art of marksmanship, how to hunt, or want to participate in competition, you will need to learn and perfect basics of shooting such as form or stance, trigger control, sight alignment, gun care, etc. 

When you have completed the mastery of the basics, you will want to devote your time to the aspect which is appealing to you. Your ultimate purpose will decide which kind of handgun or rifle is best for you. 
A Few Definitions When you are starting a new hobby, sometimes the verbiage can be confusing. What is the difference between a shotgun and a rifle anyway? Here is a short glossary to help you out. 

Ammunition - The material which is fired from your firearm, i.e. bullets or shot. 

Bullet - A bullet is a small projectile made of metal which is fired from either a handgun or a rifle. Bullets come in a wide range of sizes and shapes. Choice is dependent upon what the shooter wants to accomplish. 

Caliber - The caliber is the approximate diameter of the barrel either measured in inches or millimeters. So, if the rifle is a .22 caliber, it will have an inside diameter of .22 inches. The same holds true for the 

Ammunition - the outside diameter of a .22 caliber bullet will be .22 inches. Caliber is basically a way of saying inches or millimeters. 

Handgun - A handgun is exactly what it says it is. It is a gun that can be held in one hand. Common handguns are revolvers and pistols. For some, revolvers and pistols are the same type of firearm while others distinguish between them by the way the ammunition is discharged. A pistol has its barrel and chamber as one piece and a revolver has a revolving chamber that holds the ammunition.   NRA - Acronym for the National Rifle Association, a well-known advocate for firearms, in all aspects. Publisher of The American Rifleman. 

Rifle - A firearm designed to hit a specific point. Rifles use bullets for ammunition. Rifles are designed for long range use. 

Sight - The sight is a device which is used to aim by guiding the shooter’s eye to align it with the weapon. There are many different types of sights - telescopic, reflex, laser and iron are among them. 

Shot - Shot is a tiny ball made of lead or steel. Many balls of shot are loaded in a plastic cartridge for discharge from a shotgun. 

Shotgun - A firearm designed to shoot a wide target with “shot”, the type of ammo it uses. Shotguns are for short range only. Shot is a long cylindrical container of hundreds of little balls made of steel or lead which is spread when the firearm is fired. 

Stance - The position your body is in while you are shooting. Three of the most basic handgun stances are Chapman, Isosceles and Weaver. The Weaver and Chapman stance are named after the men who made them popular and Isosceles is just what it says - the shooter’s body and arms form an isosceles triangle. 
Safety There is a section for tips and tricks further on in this article, but before we begin to talk about beginning with this sport, we would like to emphasize the importance of safety. The NRA has published a list of safety tips that are important for all shooters to familiarize themselves with and learn. 

1. The gun should always be pointed away from people. 

2. Until ready to use, the shooter should always keep his or her finger off the trigger. 

3. You should keep your firearm unloaded when not in use. 

4. When handling a firearm, make sure the safety is on. 

5. You should only use the ammunition designed for your firearm. If it is a .38 caliber, only use .38 caliber cartridges. 

6. You should never, under any circumstance, shoot while using alcohol or any type of drug, over-the-counter or otherwise. 

7. Always store your guns so that unauthorized people cannot access them. 
Getting Started A generally preferred handgun for beginners is the .22 caliber handgun. They are accurate enough for the beginner, whether they plan on engaging in “plinking” which is informal target practice (think cans on a fence) or want to start participating in competition. As a matter of interest, if you are looking to just do some casual target practice, never shoot at glass objects. This causes problems for everyone. Most .22 caliber handguns will shoot within an inch at 25 yards so they are good for target shooting at 50 feet which is a good starting point, and a generally accepted range.   The kind of ammunition you use will affect your handgun’s accuracy, so begin by buying several different brands of ammunition and practice with all of them. You will find one that suits the way you shoot within your price range. 

Perhaps the most popular reason to start with a .22 cal. is that it is inexpensive to shoot. The ammunition for the handgun is approximately one-tenth the price of ammunition for a larger .38 caliber. It does not matter if you are planning on shooting a larger handgun later on, all of the techniques of hold, trigger pull, stance, safe handling, positions, and aiming are the same no matter what the gun caliber. 

If you prefer to begin with a rifle, there are a few more things to consider than with a handgun. 

As with the handgun, a .22 rimfire made for the Long Rifle cartridge is your best rifle to begin. It’s economical in that the .22 LR is a very popular cartridge in the United States, so their availability is assured and because of the volume in which they are sold, they are cheap. Other advantages are they have a low recoil and great accuracy. 

You may want to consider what is known as a youth rifle if you are young or very small. They are light in weight and have shorter stocks, so they are more comfortable to shoot. They are good for plinking or casual target shooting. If you are interested in using your rifle for hunting, these are also good at a short range. The most well known youth rifle is the Chipmunk bolt action single shot. It weighs around two to three pounds. 

For those who want to begin with targeting for competition, the .22 target rifles are very accurate. For NRA competitions, the ten ring for prone, or lying down, shooting is only two inches in diameter and the ring used to break ties is a mere one inch. Obviously, you will need to keep your shots within such a small target in order to win matches, so you will need an extremely accurate rifle. Your rifle will need to have sub-minute of angle intrinsic accuracy. In layman’s terms, a minute of angle is equal to an offing of one inch at 100 yards distance. 

Before you decide to buy any sort of target rifle, make sure to go to some local target matches and speak with the contestants. They will be your best source of information and are always willing to give plenty of advice. 

For those who just want to have some fun, plinking is going to be your best source. It is the most common and most popular of the types of shooting, because it is the most fun. Plinking is great practice if you want to work on your technique, stance, and so forth, but can sometimes lead to sloppy habits because it is so informal. The key with plinking is to forget your misses and only count your hits. One thing to always remember is that you should always try to improve. You need to be sure to pay attention to your trigger control, stance and sight alignment with every shot you take. Even when plinking, it is a lot more fun to hit a target than to miss one. 

For those who want to get into hunting, with a .22 you are going to want to focus on small game animals like squirrels and rabbits. Your rifle should be precise enough to hit a head shot on small game at 75 yards. This is almost within the target rifle accuracy range, but a target rifle is not a good hunting rifle; it is not very well suited to be carried out in the field. 

When you are out in the field hunting, most of your shots are going to be taken from the standing or the sitting position, so you should practice these two positions a lot if you want to become an accomplished hunter. You should always shoot sitting if you possibly can - it is an extremely versatile position and a lot more accurate than standing. 
Well-Known Brands Of Handguns And Rifles There are many different kinds and brands - it can be confusing to choose when you are a beginner. Here is a very brief list of some of the most trusted brands. 

Handguns 

Ruger – Springfield –Remington-Smith & Wesson- Colt- Rifles- Remington- Anschutz- Kimber- Marlin- Savage 
Cost Involved Handguns can cost anywhere from $100 - $5,000, the prices listed below are a basic generalization. 

• Used basic target .22s with adjustable sights - $225 to $600 

• Used Semi-autos - $350 to $500 

• Used carry type (short barrel) Revolvers - $250 and up 

• The best deal in used revolvers is the guns that the police departments started selling when they switched from revolvers to semi-autos. They can be found in .38 and .357 caliber for prices sometimes as low as $100. 

Classes are available for those wishing to be taught safety, proper stance and handling techniques. Popular classes typically offered are pistol safety, pistol self-defense, pistol competition, rifle safety, rifle self-defense, and rifle competition. The cost will depend on what class you are taking i.e. for certification or just personal knowledge, whether you go with a group and other factors. 
Tips And Tricks o The larger caliber of your handgun means it has a heavier bullet. The heavier the bullet means it will travel farther. It also means your gun will have less recoil. 

o A correct grip while standing in the correct position will make it easier for you to handle your handgun during the recoil. 

o A long sight on your gun means you will be able to shoot farther. 

o A good barrel six of five and six inches assures good accuracy. 

o Remember that in most cases, you get what you pay for. A good quality gun will often shoot more accurately than the person handling it. 

o Ammunition affects accuracy. 

o Master these fundamentals to be a good marksman - sight picture and trigger control. 

o Television is not real life. Do not expect your gun handling experience to be like what you see in the movies or on television. 

Here are some tips for shooting a good score. It’s as easy as 1-2-3! 

1. Hold your firearm as still as you can. One way to accomplish this is to build up the strength in your arm until you can hold your firearm in the correct stance for a full minute. 

2. Focus only on your front sight while maintaining perfect sight alignment. 

3. Press the trigger without moving your other fingers. This one is tricky as your fingers are made to move in conjunction with each other. The key is to relax your forefinger while keeping a nice firm grip on the handle of your firearm. This will take practice, so don’t give up if you can’t do it after the first few tries. 
Conclusion We hope this article has been helpful to you, the beginner. While the shooting sports can be confusing at first because of the broad range of the sport, it is not impossible to navigate. Pinpoint what it is you wish to do, then familiarize yourself with the firearms, ammunition, and of course, safety requirements for your decision..",
Billiards-Pool,"Billiards-Pool Information  Intro Billiards is one of the indoor games that is fast gaining momentum across the world, thanks to more and more people embracing it as a hobby. While it can be played on a snooker table, billiards is not the same as snooker. Quite a few pubs, bars and billiards clubs are good places to play and practice the game. 

Just eight balls are required to play billiards. While you don’t need a PhD in physics to become proficient at the game, an understanding of some principles of physics certainly helps. Billiards can be played alone or with friends. You need mental focus, concentration and the ability to calculate. Billiards is also a whole lot of fun when you just want to relax at the end of a long day, while chatting with your friends or co-players, yet enjoying the challenge of this wonderful game. 
Getting Started With Playing Billiards Billiards is considered a complex game. There are rules you must abide by. Some fundamental aspects of billiards are the rules of the game, principles of the game, cut shots, bank shots, effects, etc. You will begin by learning your stance. This is very important since it will affect your ability to shoot no matter what your weight, height or age. But as you get proficient at the game, you will discover that different players who are very successful do develop their own successful style. You will learn about how to grip and aim the cue stick. 
What Kind Of Equipment Is Used? Equipment used in billiards in pool tournaments must conform to the standards of the World Pool-Billiards Association. This however, does not apply to the billiard equipment you use at home. The billiard table itself comes in a variety of sizes in rectangular shape. There are 3.5 x 7 ft, 4 ft x 8 ft, 4.5 ft x 9 ft and 5 ft by 10 ft. tables commonly used. The table has a rail of about 4 inches-7.5 inches wide along with the rubber cushions. The table has pockets or mouths. There are corner pockets and side pockets. These pockets are lined. The billiard table is covered by a cloth that neither pills or fluffs and is usually in yellow green, blue green or electric blue. 

A set of billiard balls is made up of one cue ball, that is white in color and fifteen colored object balls that are numbered from one to fifteen. These numbers are printed twice in black on a white background to be highly visible. The cue sticks that you see in pool tournaments should be 40 inches long with a cue tip that is about 14 mm wide. The tip must be made of special leather that does not spoil the billiard balls. 

The billiard balls are placed in the table. The white cue ball strikes the other balls into the pockets with the help of the cue stick. 

While some people prefer to slowly put together their own billiard equipment, you can also play at a pool bar or billiard hall. 
Types Of Games Played As we said, billiards is played on a table with a cue stick that strikes the balls that move around on the table. There are a variety of billiard ball games. 

In 8-ball games as well as straight pool, you will use 16 balls where there is one white ball or cue ball and 15 colored balls. The object balls are numbered one to seven and in solid color. Balls 9 to 15 are white with a colored stripe, matching one solid ball each. Ball 9 has a yellow stripe. Ball 10 has a blue stripe. Ball 8 is black. 

If you pick an easy game in billiards, it is the Three Cushion billiard game that is played on a table without any pockets. This game needs three balls – red yellow and white. The aim of the game is to use the cue ball to hit the other two balls on the table, together with three or more rails. 

Another game is the Straight Rail or Free Game where the cue ball hits the other two balls to score a point. 

Balkline is similar to Straight Rail and played on a table with 18 inch lines from each rail, making up nine boxes on the table. 

There are several others, but Three Cushions is the most popular.

Mah Jong,"Mah Jong Information  Intro Mah Jong is a Chinese game, very much similar to rummy. It is an exciting game requiring four players. Some variations can be played by three. Playing the game requires strategy, skills, calculations and luck. The game is very popular in Asia as gambling game. In western countries, the game was introduced as a hobby game to while away free time. In a typical game, you get 13 or 16 tiles and you have to make four groups, also known as ‘melds’, and a pair or ‘head’ before other players to win the game. 

There are many theories regarding the origin of the game. Some believe that the renowned philosopher Confucius invented the game in 500 BC. However, the first evidence of the game as we know it has been found as late as 1850, though forms of the game have been known to be played in China for centuries. The game was banned in China in 1949 by the newly formed Communist government, which forbade gambling activities. After the Cultural Revolution in China, the game was revived and soon became popular in other neighboring countries like Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, too. Mah Jong was introduced into America in the 1920s. It soon became very popular. Joseph Park Babcock wrote a book of rules for Mah Jong, which later became popular as the ‘Red Book’. Today, there are many organizations around the world, which hold world tournaments for the game and have varying rules. 

The game was very popular in Asia, and America as a hobby and gambling game. Now all countries also play the game with many variations. Apart from the Chinese Classical Mah Jong, the other popular forms are Hong Kong/Cantonese Mahjong, Sichuan Mah Jong, Taiwanese Mah Jong, Japanese Mah Jong, Western Classical Mah Jong, American Mah Jong (it is very different from the original one), 3-player Mah Jong, Singapore Mah Jong and so on. The Chinese government is trying to popularize the game, and is putting in all efforts to make the game popular as a friendly and social activity. The game was converted into a “healthy sport” (without gambling) in 1998 with the introduction of Chinese Official Rules, also known as International Tournament rules. 
Learning The game might seem to be quite difficult on the onset as it involves quite a bit of calculations and skills. However, once you become used to it, it becomes quite easy and entertaining. The basic equipments of a game of Mah Jong are dice, chips and tiles. It also includes bone tiles for scoring and indicator tile denoting the dealer and prevailing wind. In present times, Internet friendly computer versions of the game have come up where you can play against the computer or a person online. The set of Mah Jong tiles differs from place to place, numbering 136 or more and divided into 3 categories namely honor, suits and flowers. 

There are three types of suits namely Dots, Characters and Bamboos. Numbered from 1 to 9 each suit has four tiles of the same number. Thus, each suit has 36 tiles. Ones and nines are known as terminals and are considered as most valuable tiles of every suit. Honor tiles constitute of four types of wind tiles and three types of Dragon tiles. Wind tiles are namely East, West, North and South, each wind having four tiles coming to 16 tiles. Dragon tiles are namely Red Green and White, which once again have four tiles each coming up to 12 tiles. Seasons or Flower tiles are used optionally in a game of Mah Jong. The four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter) and Flowers (Plum, Orchid, Chrysanthemum and Bamboo) are matched to East, South, West and North respectively. 
Playing In order to decide the prevailing wind and the dealer of the game, each player throws three dice. The player who has highest score becomes the dealer and has East wind. Player sitting on his right has South wind, the next player on the right has West wind and the remaining player on dealer’s left has North wind. Unless the dealer wins, game wind changes to the next player following every round. The prevailing wind changes and moves from left to right after each player has lost one game as a dealer. 

All the tiles are placed face down and shuffled. Each player then has to stack a row that is two tiles high, length depending upon the number of tiles to be used. Each player has 17-stack row for 136 tiles game, 18-stack row for 144 tiles, 19-stack row for 152 tiles and 19 stacks for dealer and player opposite to him and 18 stacks in a 148 tiles game. The dealer then throws three dice and the sum total is found. A player’s stack is chosen and the ‘sum’ tiles from the right edge are shifted to the right hand side. The dealer then takes four tiles from the left hand side. Moving counterclockwise, each player takes a block of four tiles from the row until each player has 12 or 16 tiles for 13-tile or 16-tile variations of the game. For the 13-tile variation, each player takes one more tile. 

The game is ready to be played and each player has to draw tiles in clockwise manner from where the drawing was left off. The dealer starts the game by drawing a tile and discarding an unwanted one. Then the player on his right makes a move. In different variation, the player has to either declare the name of the discarded tile or place it face down. Players who have flower tiles should immediately replace it with tiles from the remaining stacks. Joker tiles are a significant part of the American variation of the game. Rules vary from one version to the other regarding the use of joker or wild card tiles. 

Each player has to make a certain combination of tiles called melds or groups and an identical pair before other players to win the game. If a player wants to use a discarded tile by other player to complete a meld he/she has to show the meld to other players. Most variations of the game have three types of melds, the American version being an exception. The three melds are Pung, Kong and Chow. Pung is a set of three identical tiles, Kong is a set of four identical tiles and Chow is a sequence of three tiles of the same suite. The pair of identical tiles is known as an Eye. 

If multiple players call for a discarded tile then the player who needs it to win, the hand/round gets precedence over others. The order of precedence is then decided by Pung, Kong and lastly Chow declarations. If two players have same declaration then the player closest to the right of the player discarding the tile gets the tile. When a player is said to have a hand with jus 1 tile to finish the hand it is called the ‘ready hand’. The player who first completes the required number of melds and an Eye is said to be the winner. 

A great diversity can be seen in the scoring system in different variations of the game, though the gameplay is more or less the same. Many attempts have been made to establish internationally recognized standards but have failed. Points not only depend upon the wining hand but also upon the wining condition, which has many sets and subsets of criteria. Points are translated to scores. When gambling, these scores are directly translated to money. 

This must have provided you with a fair idea of the ancient Chinese game Mah Jong. So, what are you waiting for? Once you have unraveled your brains and have the pungs, kongs and chows sorted out, get the tiles, start plying Mah Jong, and make it your favorite hobby.",
Songwriting,"Songwriting Information  Intro Most music lovers have the urge to take up songwriting as a hobby at some time or other in their lives. If you have felt it too, then now is the right time to get started. While there are no actual rules to song writing, there are a few fundamental points that will help you become the sort of songwriter you want to be, or just get better at the skill. Who knows, your song could be on everyone’s lips tomorrow! So let’s talk about some basic information that you should know about when it comes to songwriting. 
What Makes A Successful Song? You’ll agree that the song must make an impact the first time it is heard. Then, you’ll need a melody that grabs the listeners. Next are the lyrics. Anyone listening to the song must be able to relate to it – and also feel like singing along. Attention must be paid to the structure of the song so that it flows and feels complete. How about genre? Does it fit the genre you are writing in? Are the sounds right and in tune? And finally – who’s singing it? Is the performer doing full justice to the song? 

Now, let’s look at the basic must-have aspects of a song if it must pull in the listener. An interesting lyric is essential. It must be so catchy that it sounds great to the listener – rather than like a monotonous reading. A good sound structure must complete the song. These three aspects will lay the foundation for the success of the song. All of these must be strong for the song to have mass appeal. You can get a pretty good idea by looking at successful songs and analyzing what makes them so popular. 
What Makes Up The Structure Of The Song? Every song has a verse, a chorus, a hook and a bridge. The chorus is a group of lines that are repeated and make the song sound catchy. The chorus can be the same or have small changes every time it is repeated through the song. Here’s where you will find the song’s hook. The hook could be the title of the song. While most songs we hear do have a chorus, it is not mandatory. The bridge of the song summarizes the song’s message, or it could give the song a memorable and sudden twist. 
Writing The Song Start with a strong song title. This can be done through a brainwave of your own – or by jotting down appropriate words on a pad. The next step is to choose the form for the song. You could pick from the verse-chorus bridge form or the verse-verse-verse form, or even the verse-verse-bridge depending on the kind of song you intend to write. You would need to work on a catchy, melodious hook with chorus – featuring the song title. The beginning and end of the chorus are two good places to put the song title in. Then, work on the verses. Here, remember that the first and last line of the verse is what your listeners will recall first. You could also create the lines before the chorus so that they sound more interesting and attention grabbing. If you are planning to add a bridge, make sure that it is unique and different – distinctive in how the words are phrased. One way to turn your song into a great one is to really carry the listener, building up the tension, so that at the final chorus, they get enthralled ad excited. Another way to jazz up your song is to include a rap. You must carefully think about where it will feature in your song. Some songs have a beautiful instrumental bridge that’s memorable and identifies the song. 

With your song almost ready, all you need to do is keep tweaking it, honing it to make sure that you are in the right genre with it. Now is the time to judge whether you want to edit some parts of the songs or make additions. 

Okay, now let us summarize the salient parts of a hit song – there could be variations depending on the type of music, but you can assume that these will more or less fit most types of music like country / pop/ rock. 

• Hook the listener at the starting line, making them eager for more 

• The song must be hum-able after the listener hears it a few times 

• No complex words – the lyrics must be easy to pick up and sing along. Let the words flow naturally 

• The lyrics must be authentic and from the heart. 

• Concentrate more on song meaning. 

• Rhyming is not mandatory – but it is certainly one of the elements that make some songs really memorable and easy to remember. But don’t overdo it. The worst thing is to force an overdose of rhymes into the song and make it look contrived. 

• Make the theme or idea of the song with as much mass appeal as possible. The more people that can identify with the song, the better 

• People should not have to think too hard to figure out what the song means. Forget clichés. 

• Let the song be roughly three to four minutes in length. 

• As far as possible avoid songs that depict pathetic males or females. Songs that keep imploring or begging are also preferably avoided. 

• Focus on a specific idea. You can make the bridge unique, but otherwise stick to one idea 

• Let the title of the song be obvious in the beginning and repeated so that people can recall it easily. 

• Great lyrics help the listener visualize the song 

• Let the song and melody be easy to recall after it is heard once. 

• Songs with a bit of mystery are also good sellers. 

One of the best ways to get truthful feedback about your song is to is to play it to strangers and see how they feel. 

Songwriting is an exciting craft and takes a good amount of effort and constant practice. While some people end up writing a song’s lyrics in an hour, some fabulous songs take days before they take shape and become ready to be sung. The important thing is to remember what makes a song successful, and keep learning as you go along.

Tarot,"Tarot Information  Introduction The belief that reading cards can provide insight into the future has been a belief of the occult for centuries. This mystical ability is one that can be learned by anyone with a dedication and devotion to the craft. Tarot card reading is often associated with gypsies and a belief in spiritual powers, but in truth tarot cards can have a different meaning and use for every person who uses them. You can believe that the power of the cards comes from just about anywhere but the underlying focus is to have a faith in the power of the cards. 

This skill is not always perfect and the cards may seem to give false readings but that may simply be because the true meaning of the cards was shrouded or because the future foretold by the cards has yet to occur. It is also important to know that each card can have numerous different meanings. 
Types of Cards There are a number of different types of cards that can be used to perform readings; the type you choose is purely a personal one. Each set of cards can sometimes be used to discern certain aspects of the future. There are Esoteric tarot decks, Tarot de Marseille in occultis , and Occult tarot decks. 
Card Meanings/Spreads Each card in the deck has a different meaning and this can change due to the position of the card and whether or not it is upside down. The card meanings can also depend on the type of spread used.  
Card Meanings While each deck comes with its own set of meaning for each card there are a number of common images that you may come across. There are also different meanings for different types of cards and different meanings for the card based on whether or not it is reversed. 

For example the Death card if upright means the beginning of new life or major changes. It can also mean the ending a certain phase in life. It does not actually have a negative meaning or foreshadow death if upright. But if the card is reversed it signifies a change that is unpleasant or painful. It can also mean mental, physical or spiritual exhaustion. Despite the bad reputation of this card in few if any decks and spreads does it actually mean death. 

The same can be said for the lovers card. Upright it means harmony and union. It also means choices that must be made using ones intellect and these choices do not even have to be about love. If the card is reversed however could point to infidelity, indecisiveness and a warning to not make any major decisions at this time. 

These two examples show that you should also read the information that is included with your cards and do the proper research before making assumptions about what the cards mean. Many times the meaning behind the cards is exaggerated in order to create a more impressive effect but true tarot card readers will embrace this ambiguity and know the importance of reading the cards together. 

If you focus on a basic deck of 78 cards that will include a number of different groupings of cards. These include the Major Arcana, the suit of wands, the suit of cups, the suit of swords and the suit of coins. Each of these suits and groupings can have different meanings based on how they are revealed and spread out together. 
Where to Buy If you are not too picky about the type of deck or how artistic the pictures are, many bookstores will offer a few tarot sets and instruction books. These tarot cards are usually very basic but will perform the same functions as a more artistic and expensive tarot card deck. These sets will usually run for less than $20 so they are a great way for beginners to get into learning to read the cards. 
How to Store Your Cards While tarot card themselves are durable and can just be kept in the case they are kept in. But many people who believe in the spiritual powers of the cards will suggest special cases or wraps for the cards. For example many cards decks will suggest that they be wrapped in silk. But this is not set in stone, because just like the meanings for each card can be ambiguous so can be the proper way to store them. 

Some people will choose to purchase special pouches or boxes with which to keep their cards. This is a way to add special care and importance to the cards, but it is not necessary. Most tarot card readers will suggest that you store and keep your cards in the way that you choose and a way that makes you feel happy and comfortable. 

Like any hobby learning how to read tarot cards is a skill that takes practice and one that you should do as long as it makes you happy. It can be a truly interesting hobby that can help you learn more about yourself and others in a very unique and spiritual way.",
Surfing,"Surfing Information  Introduction Surfing is a very popular activity in those areas where the waves are high enough to make it possible. While most people think of California and Hawaii as great places to engage in surfer, there are other places as well including the beaches of Tahiti. However, before you start surfing, you want to make sure you have enough experience to handle yourself on the waves. It is not difficult to learn how to surf, but you do need to choose the surfboard that is right for your skill level before moving up to a board that is intended for more skillful surfers. 
History of Surfing Surfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian culture. Surfing was first observed by Europeans at Tahiti in 1767, by the crew members of the Dolphin. When Mark Twain visited Hawaii in 1866 he wrote, 

""In one place we came upon a large company of naked natives, of both sexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing."" 

References to surf riding on planks and single canoe hulls are also verified for pre-contact Samoa, where surfing was called fa`ase`e or se`egalu and Tonga. 

Hawaii, once part of the Polynesian Islands before becoming part of the United States, is one of the most popular places for surfing. Captain James Cook made the first European visit to Hawaii in 1778 when he and his crew aboard the HMS Discovery and Resolution stopped at the western end of the island as they returned from Tahiti and the northwest coast of North America. He spent a year looking for a route from the North Pacific into the Atlantic before returning to the islands and on this trip stopping on the Big Island. Lieutenant James King, commander of the Discovery, penned the first written account of Hawaiian surfing by a European in 1779. 

The sport had become an essential part of Hawaiian culture by 1779. Surfboard riding was as much a part of the islands as baseball the modern sport of baseball is to the United States. Chiefs were able to demonstrate their mastery while commoners became famous (or not) based upon the way they handled themselves while riding the waves of the ocean. Commoners tended to surf the waves in an upright position on boards up to twelve feet compared to chiefs who tended to ride the waves lying down on boards as long as 24 feet. 

Anthropologists are uncertain about the origin and evolution of surfing because of the uncertainty of the timeline and movements of the Polynesians. They do know that humans began to migrate from Asia and into the eastern Pacific around 2000 B.C. when Polynesians established themselves within a large triangle that included New Zealand (then known as Aotearoa), Tonga and Samoa, and Tahiti and the Marquesas. However, the first Polynesians arrived in the Hawaiian Islands during the fourth century A.D. 

When the Polynesians arrived in Hawaii they also brought their customs with them, one of which included using belly boards. Although Tahitians may occasionally stand on their boards, using long boards to surf while in an upright position was perfected (and possibly invented) in Hawaii. Even before Captain Cook arrived in Hawaii, surfing had become a legend and culture that were centuries old. His arrival also helped undo some taboos including prior separation on the beaches of the chiefs and commoners. 

Surfing incidents that became part of Hawaiian legends played roles in the naming of places. The experts (called kahuna) spoke special chants for different reasons including the christening of new surfboards, bringing the surf off and to provide courage to those who challenged the big waves. Since Hawaiians had no written language until the arrival of white-skinned people, their history and genealogy prior to that time are recorded in songs and chants. 
Surfing Maneuvers Surfing begins when the surfer finds a ridable wave on the horizon and then attempts to match its speed (by paddling or sometimes, by tow-in). Once the wave starts to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and proceeds to ride down the face of the wave, generally staying just ahead of the breaking part (white water) of the wave (in a place often referred to as the pocket or the curl). 

Once a surfer learns the basic maneuvers and is able to keep his board upright when riding the waves, he is then ready to move onto more complex maneuvers. Even these more complex maneuvers are based on skill levels, so you don’t want to begin with something that extends beyond your level of expertise on the waves or you will discover you are recovering from immersion into the waves more often than riding them. 

Some of these advanced maneuvers rely on the surfer’s ability to maintain speed and balance. Until you can master those basic skills you do not want to try anything more complex, especially those maneuvers that require you to change positions on the board or ride the higher waves. 
Learning to Surf Typical surfing instruction is best performed one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting. Popular surf locations such as Hawaii and Costa Rica offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. 

Surfing can be broken into several skills: drop in positioning to catch the wave, the pop-up, and positioning on the wave. Paddling out requires strength but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (duck diving, eskimo roll). 

Those who live in regions where surfing is popular are in a better position to learn the various surfing techniques. It is also important to know the best kinds of waves for surfing. While many places that are off the ocean may have waves, those waves may not be conducive to surfing. For example, most beaches off the coast of the Atlantic Ocean have waves that are too “tame” for surfing though they may be perfect for water skiing and body surfing. 

You will also find many online courses on surfing, many that include videos. These courses are good places to start if you are planning to travel to an area where surfing is popular, but you have to remember watching surfing on a video is different than actually doing it. Never rely on reading books or watching videos but rather remember you must practice in order to learn how to surf well enough to handle the more complex maneuvers and build the speed and agility you need to surf in the big waves. 

While the Pacific Ocean has the waves that are more conducive to surfing, you can certainly learn to surf in the Atlantic where the waves are less likely to be raging at break neck speed and velocity. These smaller and less ferocious waves allow you to learn how to surf without the greater fear you will experience when trying to learn to surf in waves that may be above your head. 
Surfing Equipment Surfing can be done on various equipment, including surfboards, longboards, Stand Up Paddle boards (SUP`s) , bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards and surf mats. 

The type of board an individual uses for surfing the waves depends on many different factors which may include any of the following: 

• Personal preference • Surfing skill and level of expertise • Location • Type of weather • Time of day (high tide will cause higher velocity waves than low or mid-tide) • Age and reaction time of the surfer 

Each surfer must take the time to learn his own body chemistry and reaction time in addition to working with his or her level of expertise. All of these factors play a part in the type of surf board that will meet the needs of a specific surfer. While you want to derive pleasure from the sport, you don’t want to put your life or that of anyone else in danger.   Before you venture into the water on your own, it’s essential to have all of the equipment you need. While you may not need everything that is listed here, you will certainly need a properly designed surfboard and the proper surfing clothing depending on the region where you are surfing. While most people think of surfing as a sport for warm weather, many surfers do actually wear a wetsuit and surf regardless of the temperature outdoors or of the water. 
Best Places to Surf Simply put, you can surf anywhere there are waves. You can surf anywhere that has waves high enough and with enough velocity to make it worthwhile. You do not have to travel to California, Hawaii or Tahiti unless you choose to do so. You do want to remember, however, that the best waves for surfing are on the Pacific Ocean. 

Some surfers may prefer to surf the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, not just because the waves do not have the same velocity as those on the Pacific Ocean but also because they feel they are in more control and can choose body surfing instead of using a board. These smaller waves also accommodate the use of a “boogey board” instead of the longer board most surfers use to capture the larger waves. 

While we have indicated here that the Pacific shore is more conducive to surfing compared to the Atlantic that does not necessarily pertain to all areas. In some parts of the southern United States you will find waves that are at least equal to those you find in the Pacific. The key is locating the regions that will allow you to surf in the waters of your dreams. 
Surfing Dangers Drowning 

Surfing, like all water sports, carries the inherent danger of drowning. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it cannot be relied on for floation, as it can be separated from the user. The leash, which is attached at the ankle or knee, keeps the surfer connected to the board for convenience but does not prevent drowning. The established rule is that if the surfer cannot handle the water conditions without his or her board then he or she should not go in. 

Some drownings have occurred as a result of leashes tangling with reefs, holding the surfer underwater. In very large waves such as Waimea or Mavericks, a leash may be undesirable, because the water can drag the board for long distances, holding the surfer underneath the wave. 

One of the most important things to keep in mind is that even if you feel you are a strong swimmer, there is a tremendous difference between swimming the length of a pool and being in the ocean. The potential for drowning increases for those who lose balance on a surfboard and do not have the strength or agility to recover themselves quickly enough in the ocean waves. Before you venture into the ocean’s waves make sure you can recover your surfboard and balance quickly when a large wave overcomes you. 

You can also reduce your chances of drowning if you surf with at least one other person. Even if you are an experienced surfer and have spent many hours on the big waves, it doesn’t hurt to take extra precautions especially if you are surfing in unfamiliar waters. You also want to make sure you are in top health when you venture into the ocean; if you are not feeling well you should stay out of the water. While this should be common sense, sometimes people are so anxious to surf they don’t stop to think about the risk they are taking. Even something as simple as coughing or sneezing could cause you to lose your balance on the board. 

Eye Damage 

Eye damage is one of the most frightening injuries a surfer can sustain. Eye injuries usually occur when a surfer’s eye comes into contact with an out of control surfboard tip. Damage to the eye can permanently damage it and cause a loss of vision. 

The best way to avoid damage to your eye or any area of your face is to equip the tip of your surfboard with a soft nose guard. It doesn’t cost very much to install these nose guards on your surf board, and they will reduce the amount of damage the tip might cause to your eye or face. 

Head Trauma 

One of the most traumatic injuries a surfer can suffer from the rails, fins and nose of a surf board is head trauma. In addition head injuries have the potential to cause acute and ongoing injuries as well according to information published in the Conservative Management of Sports Injuries. Some of the other causes of surfing-related injuries include coral reefs, hard sand on the floor of the ocean and submerged rocks. In addition, the Conservative Management of Sports Injuries also states the most common head and neck injuries related to surfing include but may not be limited to the following: 

• Concussion • Fractures of the cervical spine • Fractures of the face, jaw, skull and teeth 

In order to prevent head injuries while surfing, you might want to invest in a soft top surfboard. Another preventive measure that is becoming more popular, especially for those surfers who choose to ride many of the treacherous waves is the use of a helmet. While there are some people who may think wearing a helmet to surf is childish, there are many who think the same thing about wearing a helmet to ride a bicycle or motorcycle. You look at the odds and make the decision for yourself. 

Lacerations 

The feet and hands are common areas of the body subject to surfboard injuries. The skin is too soft to handle the trauma that results from contact with the sharp edges of a surfboard fin or a sharp coral reef that is hidden beneath a wave. A laceration incurred while surfing can create the need for stitches and lead to infection if it is not treated promptly. Choosing a surfboard with softer fins and wearing booties on your feet can reduce the potential for injuries to your hands and feet. You may not look like the world’s most adept surfer in this get up, but you will save yourself time out of the water and in the doctor’s office or emergency room. 

Shoulder Strain 

While it isn’t common for surfers to adapt to the habit of stretching, it is actually one of the best things they can do in order to prevent overuse, a condition that can lead to problems with the Rotator-cuff and tendinitis. These conditions are usually more prominent among beginning surfers because of poor paddling techniques and older surfers who have spent years paddling. If you get into the habit of performing stretching exercises for just ten minutes a day you will avoid potential shoulder injuries.",
Motorcycle Stunts,"Introduction to Motorcycle Stunts and SafetyMotorcycle stunts and tricks are nothing new to the world of motorcycle riding or motorcyclists around the world. In recent years, especially the past two decades though, motorcycle stunts and tricks have gained a wider audience and attention among thrill seekers and fans of such acrobatic tricks that seem to defy nature, gravity, and the laws of physics.

It’s important to note, however, that motorcycle stunts and tricks that one may see performed in movies, on television programs, or live during controlled performances are carried out by the most skilled professionals and that by attempting any of these stunts by an amateur can lead to potentially serious injuries and even death. The collateral damage that is possible can also result in major violations and legal issues. 
Motorcycle stunts and tricks are defined generally as maneuvers carried out on a motorcycle or dirt bike that are outside of the realm of normal operation. Each passing year there are more stunts and tricks being devised and designed by people around the world, with some capturing the attention and imagination of fans of this exciting pastime.

Wheelies are the most traditional and well-known type of stunt that is performed on a motorcycle and has been around since almost the beginning of the machine itself. Many people can report having witness wheelies being performed on the street, in parking lots, and even private locations, some with more success that others. A wheelie is where the engine is revved up high and the front wheel is lifted off the ground. The motorcycle then rides on the back wheel for a determined amount of time. The world record currently holds at more than 145 miles of continuous riding with a wheelie.
There are also variations on the wheelie, such as the rider performing acrobatic stunts while the motorcycle is in this particular position. Some might liken these stunts to those performed by gymnasts, with the legs being dangled from the side of the bike, lifted over the handlebars, or elevated over the riders head, putting him or her in an upside down position.Getting involved in motorcycle stunts and tricks requires more than simply taking out one’s motorcycle from the garage and seeing what one can do. It requires some planning, careful consideration on the location for performing or practicing these types of tricks and stunts, and safety equipment. Without the proper attention to these details, serious injuries are not only possible, but likely.Before you set out to begin performing stunts or tricks on your motorcycle, understand the basics and take all proper precautions necessary.
  Safety First and foremost in any motorcycle stunt or trick is safety. When it comes to performing these death-defying stunts, there can never be too many safety measures in place. The first thing that any rider who is planning on attempting such stunts and tricks should take into account is the safety of any people as well as any property that is within the range of their motorcycle.Even though a rider may look around at the local mall parking lot and see a wide open area without any cars parked there, this isn’t the best location to practice these stunts. For starters, those properties are private lots and the rider could be cited for reckless driving or even trespassing. Second, even though the nearest person or vehicle may be one hundred feet away, a motorcyclist who looses control can easily travel that far in a matter of seconds, putting those innocent bystanders in danger.Motorcycle stunts and tricks often require that the rider rev the engine to high RPMs, putting the bike under intense torque, which can cause the rider to lose control quickly, before he knows what happened.Seek out a location that is isolated, has no other vehicles around, and where you can safely and legally practice your maneuvers. This may require you to find a private empty lot, locate the owner of the lot, and seek permission. When there are no other people around, other than those helping you, then you will not put anyone in unnecessary danger. Personal safetyThe state or locale in which you live may not require that you wear a helmet for your own protection, but when taking on motorcycle stunts, you should never be without one. A full-face helmet, meaning one that covers the entire head, is the best option. A half helmet (or one that only covers the top of the head) may help protect you in the event of a fall or crash, but 64% of all crashes involving the head make contact with the ground on the chin and jaw line, which are not protected with half helmets.Next are elbow and knee pads. When you begin your quest to become the next great motorcycle stunt rider, you are going to fall. A lot. You may have seen some of the best riders in the world perform their stunts wearing nothing but shorts and a tee-shirt, but rest assured they didn’t start out that way. Make sure that your knees and elbows are well protected.Strong boots are also a must. Steel toed boots are ideal as they will effectively protect your foot and ankles from the hot pips and accidental drops of the bike that land on your feet.Gloves are another benefit as they will protect your skin of your hands from the ground as well as the hot components of the motorcycle that you may come in contact with while learning and practicing your stunts.Whatever you do, don’t underestimate the importance of safety when taking on the adrenaline rush of motorcycle stunts. Motorcycle safetyWhile you want to be safe and wear the right clothing to keep you safe, you can also add a number of safety items to your motorcycle to protect it and yourself from dangerous crashes. There are scrape bars (which attach to the rear of the motorcycle, just behind the second seat, that are used to keep the bike from flipping over when attempting a wheelie), and crash cages (that protect not only the rider’s legs and feet, but also the engine itself).What kind of equipment and safety gear you use is entirely up to the individual, of course, but overestimating one’s ability to successfully perform different stunts has often been one of the main reasons people don’t buy the proper safety gear, and also the number one reason why these same people end up seriously injured, or paying thousands of dollars to repair or replace their motorcycle.",
Soap Making,"Soap Making Information  Introduction Soapmaking is a fun, simple and low cost hobby that is a great activity for the entire family. While many people choose to buy their soap from retailers and stores, making your own soap has a lot of advantages. First you can easily control the ingredients in the soap you make at home, eliminating chemicals, dyes or artificial ingredients that may lead to skin allergies, dry skin and minor or severe skin irritations. By adding different natural ingredients and essential oils you can create beautiful colors and scents with your home made soaps that are completely unique and distinct. You can also create soaps that have moisturizers, antibacterial properties and even soothe irritated and dry skin all to your very own customized recipes. 

Second but no less important is the cost saving factor in making your own soap. Base material is readily available in hobby stores as well as through online craft and soap retailers, definitely decreasing the cost per bar over commercially available soaps. Since molds can be reused and the oils, fragrances, colors and special ingredients can likewise be purchased in bulk beautiful soaps are easily created as needed, keeping color and fragrances fresh and vibrant not old and stale like so many commercially available soaps. 

Soapmaking is a very old process that was originally part of the daily routines in a home. While many of the same processes are used in home soapmaking today, there are several ingredients that can be used to simply the process. Different shapes of molds, various ingredients and even herbal or other types of natural exfoliants can be added to make wonderful gift soaps for any time of the year. 
Soap Making Processes The most popular soapmaking process today is the cold process method, where fats such as olive oil react with lye, while some soapers use the historical hot process. 

Handmade soap differs from industrial soap in that, usually, an excess of fat is used to consume the alkali (superfatting), and in that the glycerin is not removed, leaving a naturally moisturizing soap and not pure soap. Additional processing of this glycerin containing soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap, which contains excess fat, is more skin-friendly than industrial soap, though if too much fat is added, it can leave users with a ""greasy"" feel to their skin. Sometimes an emollient such as jojoba oil or shea butter is added ""at trace"" (the point at which the saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken) in the belief that it will escape the saponification and remain intact, or in the case of hot process soap - after most of the oils have saponified so that they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process called a lye discount, where, instead of putting in extra fats, the soap maker puts in less lye. 

Cold-process soapmaking takes place at a sufficient temperature to ensure the liquefication of the fat being used. The lye and fat may be kept warm after mixing to ensure that the soap is completely saponified. 

Unlike cold-processed soap, hot-processed soap can be used right away because lye and fat saponify more quickly at the higher temperatures used in hot-process soapmaking. 

Hot-process soapmaking was used when the purity of lye was unreliable, and this process can use natural lye solutions, such as potash. The main benefit of hot processing is that the exact concentration of the lye solution does not need to be known to perform the process with adequate success. 

Cold-process soapmaking requires exact measurements of lye and fat amounts and computing their ratio, using saponification charts to ensure that the finished product is mild and skin-friendly. Saponification charts can also be used in hot-process soapmaking, but are not as necessary as in cold-process soapmaking.  
Hot process In the hot-process method, lye and fat are boiled together at 80–100 °C until saponification occurs, which before modern thermometers, the soapmaker determined by taste (the bright, distinctive taste of lye disappears once all the lye is saponified) or by eye; the experienced eye can tell when gel stage and full saponification have occurred. Beginners can find this information through research, and classes. It is highly recommended to not ""taste"" soap for readiness. Lye, when not saponified is a highly caustic material. After saponification has occurred, the soap is sometimes precipitated from the solution by adding salt, and the excess liquid drained off. The hot, soft soap is then spooned into a mold. The soap lye is processed for recovery of Glycerine.  
Cold process A cold-process soapmaker first looks up the saponification value of the fats being used on a saponification chart, which is then used to calculate the appropriate amount of lye. Excess unreacted lye in the soap will result in a very high pH and can burn or irritate skin. Not enough lye, and the soap is greasy. Most soap makers formulate their recipes with a 4-10% deficit of lye so that all of the lye is reacted and that excess fat is left for skin conditioning benefits. 

The lye is dissolved in water. Then oils are heated, or melted if they are solid at room temperature. Once both substances have cooled to approximately 100-110 °F (37-43 °C), and are no more than 10°F (~5.5°C) apart, they may be combined. This lye-fat mixture is stirred until ""trace"" (modern-day amateur soapmakers often use a stick blender to speed this process). There are varying levels of trace. Depending on how additives will affect trace, they may be added at light trace, medium trace or heavy trace. After much stirring, the mixture turns to the consistency of a thin pudding. ""Trace"" corresponds roughly to viscosity. Essential oils, fragrance oils, botanicals, herbs, oatmeal or other additives are added at light trace, just as the mixture starts to thicken. 

The batch is then poured into molds, kept warm with towels, or blankets, and left to continue saponification for 18 to 48 hours. Milk soaps are the exception. They do not require insulation. Insulation may cause the milk to burn. During this time, it is normal for the soap to go through a ""gel phase"" where the opaque soap will turn somewhat transparent for several hours, before once again turning opaque. The soap will continue to give off heat for many hours after trace. 

After the insulation period the soap is firm enough to be removed from the mold and cut into bars. At this time, it is safe to use the soap since saponification is complete. However, cold-process soaps are typically cured and hardened on a drying rack for 2–6 weeks (depending on initial water content) before use. If using caustic soda it is recommended that the soap is left to cure for at least four weeks.  
Molds Many commercially available soap molds are made of silicone or various types of plastic, although many soap making hobbyists may use cardboard boxes that are lined with plastic wrap. Soaps can be made in long loaves that are cut into individual bars, block molds that are cut into loaves and then bars, or individual molds.  
Purification and finishing The common process of purifying soap involves removal of sodium hydroxide, glycerol and some impurities. These components are removed by boiling the crude soap curds in water and re-precipitating the soap with salt. 

Most of the water is then removed from the soap. This was traditionally done on a chill roll which produced the soap flakes commonly used in the 1940s and 1950s. This process was superseded by spray dryers and then by vacuum dryers. 

The dry soap (approximately 6-12% moisture) is then compacted into small pellets. These pellets are now ready for soap finishing, the process of converting raw soap pellets into a saleable product, usually bars. 

Soap pellets are combined with fragrances and other materials and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner which, by means of an auger, forces the soap through a fine wire screen. From the refiner the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) in a manner similar to calendering paper or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion it passes through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways. 

Sand or pumice may be added to produce a scouring soap. The scouring agents serve to remove dead skin cells from the surface being cleaned. This process is called exfoliation. Many newer materials are used for exfoliating soaps which are effective but do not have the sharp edges and poor particle size distribution of pumice. 
Equipment And Recipes The basic equipment to make soap is very simple. You will need a large bowl or measuring cup to melt the base or tallow, depending on the type of soap you wish to create. Oils such as olive oil, palm oil, jojoba oil, castor oil, canola oil, soy bean oil and coconut or grapeseed oils are typically used in the basic melt and pour types of soaps as well as in cold process lye soaps. The melt and pour soaps use an already prepared base material which prevents the necessity of the lye step in soap making which can be rather challenging if this is your first time making soap. 

Always carefully monitor the use of lye and avoid contact with the skin at all times until it has been mixed with oils. Lye can be very caustic and children should never be allowed to be around the lye and water mixture as they often forget safety procedures and end up with lye burns from contact with the liquid. 

Although tallow or animal fat was traditionally used in soap making, there is no need to stick with this animal based material anymore. The vegetable oils mentioned above are ideal for making soap, just be sure that the recipe calls for vegetable oils rather than tallow. Animal fats in soaps do tend to create a different texture to the soap, which may be an important consideration. Lard based soaps are softer and tend to be a bit more challenging for those new at soapmaking while tallow or animal fat soaps tend to be very hard and brittle. 

General cold process equipment is very simple. All you require is a glass bowl of large enough size to combine the distilled water and the lye. Use a stainless steel pot to melt the oils and slowly add the heated lye and water mixture to the oils. Start stirring slowly and watch for the ""trace"" to develop. Trace is a thin pudding like consistency in the mixture that shows that the soap is forming. After the trace is reached, add any essential oils, fragrances, herbal ingredients, exfoliants or other ingredients required and stir well. Pour the liquid into the prepared molds and cover with a towel to prevent drying out of the surface of the soap quickly, resulting in a dull, uneven finish. Allow to sit for about 48 hours and remove the towels, allow the soap to completely firm up in the molds, typically about three to five days. You will still need to allow the soap to fully cure, which is known as soaponification, for about six weeks. Store in a cool, dry area away from direct sunlight and heat to avoid any dulling or irregular surfaces on the soap. 

A simple recipe that makes about 4 pounds of soap using the cold process method follows: 

16 ounces of Coconut Oil 16 ounces of Palm Oil 16 ounces of Olive Oil 7 ounces of 5% superfatted Lye 16 ounces of distilled water 

To this mixture add any desired essential oils or fragrances as well as natural dyes or colorings after the trace appears. Start with a very small amount of these ingredients and add more as needed with each batch. Since this basic recipe makes about 4 pounds you can easily adjust between matches for more color or fragrance. 

One essential piece of kitchen equipment that can also be a time saver in making home made soap is a stick blender. These little low cost hand held blenders are ideal for stirring the combination of the lye/water and oil mixtures until the trace forms. With hand mixing with a spoon or stirring stick the process can take up to an hour, the stick blender can cut this down to under 10 minutes per batch. Using the blender helps to cool the liquid faster and increase the soap process. Unfortunately it can also incorporate a lot more bubbles into the soap if it is used incorrectly. Running the stick blender in the thicker soap mixture will also quickly burn out the motor so only use for 30 seconds or less at a time, blend by hand in between for the best combination of fast cooling and clear, bubble free soap. 

There are a variety of different commercially available soap molds from hobby stores in all types of shapes and patterns. You can also make simple wooden soap molds that produce rectangular, square, diamond shaped or your own customized shapes of soaps in a variety of sizes. The larger soap molds can allow you to pop the big block out of the mold and use a miter box to cut perfectly square or rectangular sides to the bars without the need for a lot of extra trimming. 

Equipment should be thoroughly cleaned between each use and, if you are using heavy fragrances, you may want to keep your supplies separate based on the oils or perfumes you are using. In addition remember that some oils and fragrances can become overwhelming when scents are combined, so it is a good idea to try out a very small sample of one recipe with any new combination. Oils and fragrances can also change over time and making large batches of scented soaps is often not a good idea unless you are going to quickly use up the supply. 
Project Ideas Besides standard bar types of soaps there are a variety of different and very unique styles of soapmaking project. You may want to consider making soap balls, which are a great way to use up trimmings from the molds or collecting and recycling scarps of homemade soaps. Kids will enjoy this activity and the various colors in the soaps used to create the soap balls can make some interesting combinations. Simply use a cheese grater to grate up the soap left-overs, then add a slight bit of water to the mix just to moisten. Wet your hands and begin squeezing the grated soap between your palms, rolling into the desired size and shape. Allow to dry on cookie racks for several days before storing. 

Liquid soap can be made using the same technique as the cold process, but you will actually use a slow cooker to heat the soap once it reaches the trace stage. The soap will continue to gently heat until it becomes translucent looking more like clear very thick liquid soap or melted lard. This typically takes about four hours, at which time add a small amount of boiling water as a test. If the soap mixture stays clear it is correctly developed and can be removed from the heat source temporarily. Additional water is added to create the liquidity you desire, at which point boric acid and water is added to the soap mixture and the fragrances or essential oils and colors are also added. The liquid soap, which is neutralized by the boric acid water mixture at the end, remains liquid and needs to be stored in a cool, dry place in sealed containers until time for use. 

Kids will enjoy the melt and pour types of soaps with a bit of help from Mom or Dad. They can also decorate the soaps by adding different colors to the base or by swirling colors through the mixture after pouring. This can be done with a toothpick for a very unique and one of a kind bar of soap. Molds for candles, candies and cookies can also be used to create seasonal shapes that kids will love to give as gifts. 

Layered soap bars or molds are another hit with both children as well as adults of all ages. Follow the same instructions for any type of soap process but divide the soap at the trace stage into as many different amounts as layers required. Add colorings to the respective soap bases and start with a thin to thick layer in the bottom of the mold and allow to sit for about 15 minutes. Press a fork into the surface of the poured layer and score the surface, then pour the second layer. Repeat as often as desired until the mold is full. If you pour the layers before the previous layer is cooled at the surface you can create some interesting swirls and random color combinations but the layers may not stick well together with some soap recipes. This is a bit of a trial and error method but the results are very dramatic and very unique depending on the color combinations you select. Avoid mixing too many fragrances in one soap mold as the result can be a beautiful bar of soap with a rather unfortunate scent combination. 
Conclusion Soapmaking is one of those hobbies that is both very rewarding as well as highly practical. While most people start by using recipes off the internet or in soapmaking books, you can also go off the basics and develop your own soap recipes. Many people have a small home business in designing and selling different types of organic, holistic and natural soaps. Oatmeal soap, flax soap and olive oil based soaps are very popular for treating and soothing dry skin, plus they are much appreciated as a gift. 

While soapmaking does take time and some practice, there are classes available in most areas to help you get started with the basics. In addition the internet offers a huge variety of videos and instructional sites that are ideal for those new to the hobby and those that have years of experience. Experimenting with different types of oils, bases and methods will allow you to develop just the soap product you are looking for.",
Hookah Smoking,"Hookah Smoking Information  Introduction Hookah, or nargila, smoking is an art. Very popular in the Middle Eastern countries, hookah smoking is rapidly becoming common in the rest of the world. There are hookah lounges where people get together to enjoy a leisurely smoke. It is quite like relaxing with coffee, chatting with friends, and lazing around. 

A hookah, also called “narghile”, “shisha” or “hubble-bubble,” can also be described as a “water pipe.” The tobacco used in hookah smoking comes in several flavors. The conventional way to smoke is to have long pieces of tobacco combined with sugar based syrup, fruit bits or fruit extract. The idea is to savor the flavors of these fruits, along with the hookah’s cooling action, to add smoothness to the experience. Hookah lounges add ice to the hookah water. Common fruit flavors are apple, peach, raspberry, mixed fruit, and many more, depending on which tobacco is being used. The combination of these flavors makes it a unique experience for the hookah smoker because the tobacco does not convert into ash; rather, it slowly cooks on the coals on the hookah. This makes for an exotic smoking pleasure. Around the world, sitting together and smoking a hookah is considered a sign of trust and bonding. 

Here’s a look at the different names a hookah is known by in different regions, the anatomy of a hookah, its types, setting up the hookah, getting started with smoking, basic maintenance of your hookah and some tips and tricks. 
Parts of a hookah The hookah can be made of glass, brass, gold, silver, wood, cane, or other materials, and you will find many decorative hookahs that are works of art. The hookah has four main parts. In general, hookahs are made of the base that holds the water, the stem, hoses, bowl, coal tray, and the various rubber grommets that seal the hookah where parts join together. 

Excluding the grommets, a hookah has four main components, The bowl, the hose, body and gaskets, and the water jar.
Body and gaskets The body of the hookah is a hollow tube. The bowl is attached to the top. Sometimes an ice bucket is attached between the body and the bowl to cool the smoke. At the bottom is a thin tube (the downstem) that is submerged in water. The point where the body meets the water jar is sealed with a gasket. Near there are at least two holes that open into the space above the water. One or more may accept a hose.  
Diffuser (optional) A diffuser is a small perforated plastic device which connects to the end of the stem. Submerged in the water-filled base, it works to break up the bubbles produced from the smoke-filtering process, creating a cleaner smoke and a subdued noise. It is used as a luxury item for a premium smoking experience and is not a required component. 
Types of hookahs You will come across different types and styles of hookahs. A majority of these are made in the Middle East and some in China. This means you have a lot of brands from which you can take your pick. 

The most common is the Egyptian style, which is considered the best quality and is mostly made of steel or brass. Egyptian hookahs offer a good, easy smoke. The stem is smooth and stylish. The glass base is of high quality and popular brands are Magdy Zidan, priced at $75, and Khalil Mamoon, priced from $120. 

Syrian hookahs are made of brass and are the main competition to Egyptian hookahs. They have shorter stems and the base takes more water. Popular brands are Nour and Al Fakher. 

Then there are the Chinese hookahs made of acrylic or aluminum. These are lightweight and less durable than the Egyptian and Syrian hookahs. They are popular because of their low prices and reasonable quality. The best-known Chinese brand is Mya Saray. 

You will also see Turkish and Iranian hookahs, which are similar to the Syrian ones but not usually exported outside the Middle East. Iranian hookah stems are made of brass, steel or wood and the glass base feature gorgeous hand paintings. 

So, when you go shopping for your hookah, be sure to find out about replacement parts. While the hose may fit universally, the parts must be easy to clean. Preferably, choose a hookah that has a separate tray on a platform rather than a fused one. Also check about exchange policies for defective pieces if you are buying online. If buying in a physical shop, inspect the hookah for cracks, chips in the glass, rust if any. Check whether the hose smells fresh or stale. Check the tongs, brushes and tray. 

There are also different sizes available, with both a single stem and multiple stems. The size of the hookah depends on your budget and use. Small hookahs are good for personal use. Medium hookahs are ideal as they can accommodate one or two smokers for an hour. The large hookahs are good for parties. 

Think about how many hoses you need – more than one means more than one smoker at a time. Ultimately, you get what you pay for. 
Getting started Now that you have a reasonable idea about the hookah and how it works, let us look at how you can get started with smoking one. It all begins with setting up your hookah.  
How to set up your hookah Start by filling the glass base of the nargile with water. Don’t fill it up too much — just make sure there’s enough water to cover the tube from the top section, say by about an inch after you place it on the base. 

Now, place the top part of the nargile over the base, the glass part. It should fit well and be airtight. Next, attach the mouthpiece to the top part and check to see that it fits airtight, just like the top over the base. This means the whole set up should fit snugly. You can check by resting your palm on the top of the hookah and sucking via the mouth piece. If your set up is airtight, you will feel a pull on your palm and see bubbles in the water. If not, obviously there is air escaping from one of the joints. Fix it by re-fitting it properly. 

Once you do that, place a little of your tobacco on top of the water pipe. If you plan to add flavors to it, you will need to cover the tobacco with aluminum foil that has been pierced a few times. 

It is now time to light the hookah charcoal and place it on top of the tobacco with a pair of tongs. Press the charcoal down gently and suck through the mouthpiece. You will see smoke building up in the base. In about three or four puffs, the slow taste of tobacco will fill your mouth. 

If you happen to have a multi-hose hookah and you plan to smoke by yourself, you must remember to seal the unused hoses with rubber stoppers. Check and seal the grommet junctions.  
A word about the tobacco You can use either tobacco or maassell, which is a combination of tobacco and a sweet substance such as honey or molasses or partially dried fruits, in your hookah. This mixture need not be dry. In the old days tobacco and these sweet things were mixed to make “jurak,” which is a moist tobacco. It was only much later, around the 1980s, that fruit-flavored tobacco was inspired by Egyptian tobacco companies experimenting with the tobacco, so that people would cut down on cigarette smoking. Consequently, you now have shisha tobacco flavored with fruits like apple, strawberry, melon, mint, cappuccino and so on, further mixed with fruit extracts. 

Sometimes, the juice from the tobacco-based molasses settles at the bottom of the hookah. So be sure to mix it before you add it to the clay bowl. Soon after you open your pack of tobacco, ensure that you store it in an airtight glass container so that it does not dry out. Glass jars also retain the flavor, making it easy to mix the tobacco before you use it. 

Tobacco-based molasses looks shredded. You can use a medium-sized bit of charcoal with these, with thick foil. There are various traditional tobacco brands like Nakhla, Afzal, Al Fakher, Al Masa, Al Waha, Al Jazeera, and others. Leafy tobaccos like Nakhla are much stronger. The flavor you choose is a matter of personal preference. Some appeal to some people, while others do not. U.S. maassell brands are Romman and Splash.  
About the hookah charcoal You will get different kinds of coals for your hookah. Some are self-lighting. The most popular are the quick light charcoals, especially with beginners, as they can be lit quickly. You also get natural coals that are devoid of any chemicals and have no taste. Experienced hookah smokers choose these. The quick light charcoals come in boxes of rolls. For the natural coal, you will need a fire pit or stove. You also get disc coals that are easy to use.  
A good smoke The best hookah smoke is that which is full of flavor and thick smoke, where you inhale effortlessly. When the coals burn, with the help of the tongs, tap the ash from the coals and move them to another area of the bowl. After half an hour of smoking, take off the screen and turn the maassell over, to move the fresh layer from below up on top. Then replace the screen and the coals. This will ensure continuous and thick smoke until you reach the end of the bowl. 

Watch out for a burning flavor because that’s not so good. If you did not fill the bowl to the brim and you get the taste of burning, you probably have too much coal. Sometimes, too much heat within a short time can also cause that burning taste. So, blow the burnt smoke out of the valve and do not inhale for a while. Remove a coal. The trick to adjusting the coal comes as you become more experienced with your own hookah. However, there are three things you can do to help: 1) Do not fill the bowl to its brim. 2) Make use of the foil that comes with your hookah. 3) In the bowl, put only one layer of coals. Don’t make a pile. And soon, you’ll get the hang of it. 
Maintaining the hookah Taking good care of your hookah can ensure that you enjoy the pleasure of smoking it for a long time. Here are some tips: 

• Cleaning your hookah pipe after each smoking session can help you get rid of any residual taste in it. With the help of a soft bristle brush, clean the pipe and the base. With a dry pipe and hose, each smoking session will be an enjoyable experience. • After every five or six smokes, do the following - remove the exhaust valve and ball bearing, run water through the valve and clean the hole with cotton. 

• Bring the shine back to your pipe stem by cleaning it every two months. To do this, soak it with some soda crystals and then clean it with a brush. • Since not all hoses are washable, you need to check for a washable warranty when you buy your hose. While leather hoses can be washed, they are sometimes reinforced with steel coil that begins to rust in a short time. 
Tips and tricks for beginners When you start hookah smoking for the first time, take care to use very little coal. Break up the tobacco into smaller pieces and then place it in the clay bowl to avoid clogging the holes in the bowl. 

In fact, you could even begin by trying molasses without tobacco until you get used to setting up the hookah. Molasses burns quite easily and you need to inhale cautiously.   Make sure that the tobacco you use is not caked; rather, it should allow the air to pass through it to give you that enjoyable smoke. Otherwise the smoke does tend to get too thick and taste burnt.   Add ice to the water in the hookah. This makes your smoke cool and smooth. If you don’t have ice cubes, ice cold water will be just as good. The water cools the smoke. 

Experiment with flavors, mixing two or more and creating your own favorite flavor. Some suggestions are mint and rose, mint and melon, cherry and cola, mango and peach, and strawberry and banana. You can do the mixing in a jar and then place it in the bowl. 

Add fruit to the base of the hookah to give it more flavor. Fruits with flavors compatible to the tobacco are better. You can add lemon or berries to the water in the hookah’s base to add to the flavor. 

You can also add wine, juice or alcohol to the water in the hookah’s base. White wine is better for a smooth, cool flavor if you have mint. Red wine goes better with apple or red grape. If you are adding alcohol, vodka will match melon, apple, mint and apricot. Be sure to add only a little. After all, it is the hookah you want to enjoy, not the alcohol. 

Remember to drink a lot of water when you smoke your hookah as it is known to make your mouth dry and lead to dehydration.  
Some Hookah etiquette There are some rules of smoking hookah that you must always remember:   • Do not light a cigarette from the burning coal of the hookah. 

• Do not place the hookah at al level higher than the level of your seat. 

• The water pipe should never be directly passed to another person. It must be put down and the person to whom you offer it must pick it up.   Enjoy your hookah smoking experience!",

Pipe Smoking,"Pipe Smoking Information  Introduction Pipe smoking is the practice of tasting / inhaling the smoke make by burning a substance (like tobacco) , inside a pipe. Though more recently smoking in general, even pipe smoking has fallen under the gun of being a questionable practice, it has been and continues to be a popular practice. Pipe smoking has been a common practice of many prominent individuals for centuries. It was and is considered to be distinguished, has a social element to it, lays the foundation for common ground in communication and socialization, has given comfort and medical benefits, and has given a great contribution to the economy of a society. 
History and Culture Culture has played an important role in pipe smoking. In most societies throughout history, smoking of many types including pipe smoking were not only encouraged but also those who did not smoke were the oddballs. In the past, elite men had smoking rooms in their homes and after dinner the men retired to the smoking room to socialize and have drinks while the women had coffee in another room. Jackets were designed specifically for smoking and were considered quite fashionable. A good host had extra pipes and tobacco or other substances to offer their guests. In the 20th century, as the media grew, advertisement was in abundance in terms of smoking pipes as well as cigarettes. Pipe smoking was embedded into ceremony and even looked upon as healthy in the respect the act of smoking was relaxing. Today, though the pipe is used for other substances, tobacco is still the most commonly used in a pipe for the obvious benefits. 
Reasons for Smoking a Pipe There are many reasons why individuals smoke pipes. In the case of Native Americans, smoking a pipe was a social or ceremonial tradition. It carried a symbolism of social interaction and purpose. For example, the peace pipe was used during peace talks between tribes and Europeans and Native Americans. Pipe smoking was also used for medicinal purposes and relaxation. Substances used in the pipes had a barring on the purpose of the pipe. For example, various herbs were used for medicinal purposes and relaxation. 

The years between the American Indians and our societies today have not changed much in terms of the purposes for pipe usage. We still today use them for socialization, medicinal, and relaxation purposes. Smoking a pipe gives the hands an activity and the mind a boost. Again the purpose is determined by the substance used in the pipe. Tobacco in a pipe is enjoyed for the relaxation of it and the socialization of it. Cannabis is used for the relaxation of the high and for medicinal purposes to ease pain and nausea. Those individuals taking chemotherapy or those individuals with nerve damage causing pain, such as neuropathy or fibromyalgia use cannabis for relief. Other substances such as opium were used for some of the same purposes. 
Benefits of Smoking a Pipe First let me say that Pipe smoking is not a healthy hobby, however it does have some benefits. Currently, any smoker will tell you that smoking is frowned upon. If you just pay attention to the media, you will see many reasons why you should not smoke anything. The fat, red meat and salt you eat in your diet everyday is much more likely to harm you than smoking 3 or 4 pipe bowls of tobacco a day. Alcohol was once considered an unhealthy habit, however the experts have more recently found that alcohol in moderation may protect against the development of certain types of heart disease. In the future, tobacco used in moderation, may be clinically found to be a health benefit. Which is more risky to your health, a couple of snack cakes or lighting up a pipe or that pill you are about to take to relax. Not all smoking is the same. Some forms of smoking are more detrimental to your health then others and excessive smoking, like anything in excess, is detrimental to your health. As with most things you do or take into your body, there are some positive affects of smoking that are not always considered. 

Many of the positive affects of smoking, especially pipe smoking are not at the forefront of the smoking propaganda. Pipe smoking is very different form cigarette smoking. Even smoking a cigarette in moderation can have some of the same positive affects as pipe smoking with minimal health risks. But as I said, “pipe smoking is very different. When an individual smokes a pipe, with tobacco, many don’t inhale the smoke all the time and they do not inhale as deeply as they do smoking a cigarette. They still get the same benefits from the smoke but not the lung damage. Most pipe smokers take a few puffs and the pipe is out and set aside. There are those who smoke to excess, just as there is with anything else but the general run of people do not continually smoke the pipe. It is treated more like a break to relax 

The psychological aspects themselves and the psychological affect on our biological systems can be profound. Smoking in general has a positive psychological affect on the smoker. However, pipe smoking is less harmful to the health for the reasons I stated. 

There are many psychological and biological benefits of smoking a pipe. Relaxation is a huge benefit when speaking of pipe smoking. There are some researchers who have found that smoking reduces stress by stimulating the brain and affecting brain chemicals such as dopamine. Throughout history, pipe smoking has been affiliated with relaxation. For example, an after dinner smoke for the men, stressful situations are relaxed by a puff on the pipe, ceremonial smoking and social smoking. Relaxation is necessary and beneficial to our biological systems 

People spend billions of dollars a year on drugs and apparatuses to help them relax. What side affects to our health do you suppose those relaxing drugs have? There is an abundance of medical information indicating that stress lowers our immune system leaving us open for diseases and illnesses. Medical documentation has also indicated that relaxation can ease pain because when you are tense, the pain that you encounter is usually a lot worse. 

Then there is the simple pleasure of smoking a pipe that has the most profound psychological affect. These benefits have been described by such people as Mark Twain, and Albert Einstein as an enjoyable and pleasurable hobby. Albert Einstein himself claimed that he felt pipe smoking helped him achieve better mental clarity when he was working on a difficult project. Others have said pipe smoking contributes to a calm and objective judgment. It has been said by many famous pipe smokers that smoking a pipe helps them concentrate and focus. When the media refers to the biological aspects of smoking they lean towards the negative side. However, as you can see, smoking has a positive psychological and biological affect on the smoker. It is suggested in much literature such as pPipesmagazine, that tobacco does not stop pain but eases pain, and in addition, it affects mood by affecting chemical balance in the brain. Archeologists throughout the north, central and south of America claim that many of the tribes they encountered regularly used tobacco to treat a wide variety of medical problems. There may not be a lot of medical evidence to substantiate the claim that pipe smoking is relaxing but any pipe smoker will attest to the fact it relaxes them. There are also economical benefits to pipe smoking. The pipe smoking industry creates job and promotes business and thereby stimulates the economy. This is a serious issue in our society today. The industry also produces revenue for our local, federal, and state governments through taxes. 
Health Effects of Smoking a Pipe There are many negative health effects from pipe smoking that should also be considered. Pipe smokers have higher rates of lung and other cancers, as well as bone and tooth loss. Additionally there are higher risk of heart disease and pulmonary disease for people that smoke pipes. Smoking pipes should be done at your own risk and done in moderation, we cant stress this enough. 
How to Smoke a Pipe There are many types of pipes available currently. There are briar wood pipes, clay pipes, calabash pipes (made of gourds), corncob pipes, and hookah pipes or water pipes to name just a few. Part of the pleasure of smoking is the apparatus which you are smoking from. Just as you want an attractive glass to drink your beverage from, you also want an appealing pipe. Since you are not sure if you will like smoking a pipe it is recommended that you go with a good pipe but not too expensive, such as briar wood pipes. They will give you the best flavor and still keep the expense to a minimum. If the pipe is too cheap you may find the tobacco will not taste as good as it should. The condition of the pipe may also affect the taste of the tobacco. Be sure you have a pipe that is in good condition and broken in. To break a pipe in choose a tobacco. There are many types and flavors of tobacco available. Fill the bowl halfway with tobacco and pack it down with your fingers, but not too tight. Hold a lit match or lighter over the bowl and draw air in through the mouth piece until the tobacco lights. Pack the tobacco down again and relight it. Do not overheat the bowl by smoking too quickly. Once you have smoked the tobacco let the pipe cool. Cover the top of the bowl with your thumb and shake it to coat the entire inside of the bowl with the ash. Let the pipe rest for 24 hours. Smoke the half bowls several times and repeat the process before filling it three fourths the way full. The more years you smoke the pipe the more broken in it will be to give you a smooth, cool smoke. Avoid poorly aligned parts on the pipe, holes or pits in the pipe, and heavier pipes. 
In Conclusion Should You Or Should You Not If you were given the choice of; should you smoke a pipe or should you feel criminal about smoking a pipe? Smoking is still legal, so no matter what some might think you are not breaking the law, at least tobacco, and in some state cannabis for medicinal purposes is not illegal either. Since we know scientifically that smoking affects dopamine and lifts your spirits, would you rather smoke a pipe or would you rather take a pill (which you probably have no idea what the long term affects will be). Research has shown that more people would rather smoke a pipe and enjoy not only the affect it has on them biologically and psychologically but take pleasure in the action of smoking it. Individuals who suffer from disease or pain that can be helped with cannabis are making the choice of smoking a pipe or taking many drugs that may or may not help control the pain and nausea. In the states that cannabis is legal and also the places where cannabis is not legal, many people have turned to using cannabis smoked in a pipe to ease pain and nausea because it works with the least amount of side affects. Many drugs, especially anti-nausea medicine used for Chemotherapy, do not work well enough and have many side affects. Appetite is lost causing the individual to be increasingly ill in other ways. Most activities you do and substances you take in life have some negative affect on your health. The best we can hope for is keeping a balance because like they say, “Everything in moderation”. So why not enjoy what life has to offer, including pipe smoking?",
Snow Mobiling,"Snow Mobiling InformationThe snowmobile, the vehicle used for snowmobiling, has several different names. Depending where you live you may hear it called a snowmachine, sled or skimobile. Regardless of what name a region calls this machine, its purpose remains the same: it is a land vehicle that a person can use to travel on the snow or ice. Snowmobiles are designed to eliminate the need for either roads or trails. Some models allow the rider to operate the vehicle in deep snow or forests, but most are used in open fields or terrains which also include lakes, paths and trails. Snowmobiles are usually designed in much the same way as motorcycles and All-terrain vehicles meaning they can accommodate the driver and possibly one other adult. They are not intended for over the road use but rather for use during the winter months on ground that is covered with snow or ice. They are not enclosed by any structure other than a windshield with an engine that supports continuous tracks in the rear of the vehicle and skis in the front so the driver can control the direction of the vehicle. Types of Snowmobiles The first vehicles for driving over the snow were developed in Wisconsin before the turn of the 20th century. Several methods were employed including adding runners and gripping fins to bicycles, using steam-propelled sleighs and converting Model T Fords by adding tractor treads to the rear and skis to the front. The first time one of these converted vehicles was used for racing was in 1926 near Three Lakes. During that particular snowmobile race, 104 of these vehicles were used; the title they earned at that time was “snowbuggies.”The prototype of the modern snowmobile was first developed in 1924 by Carl Eliason of Sayner. He created this prototype by mounting a small gas-powered marine engine on a long toboggan. The driver then steered the vehicle with a pair of skis mounted under the front and a single track in the rear. Eliason patented his creation in 1926 after which he made 40 snowmobiles. After he received an order from Finland for 200 snowmobiles, he sold his patent to the FWD Company in Clintonville who ultimately made 300 for the military before they transferred the patent to a Canadian subsidiary.The Aerosan was a propeller-powered snowmobile that ran on skis. It was built in 1909-1910 by Igor Sikorsky. These snowmobiles were used to the Winter War and World War II by the Soviet Red Army. There is some controversy over whether Aerosans are actually snowmobiles since they do not run on tracks; however, if we do place them in the category of snowmobiles, they are the first ones built.Adolph Kegresse is responsible for designing the first caterpillar tracks system which was called, not surprisingly, the Kegresse track. He accomplished this feat while he was working for Tsar Nicholas II of Russia between 1906 and 1916. This track system relied on a flexible belt instead of the interlocking metal segments that had been used previously. This new track had the capability of being attached to a car or truck in order to create a half-track that could be used on soft ground including snow. The device was comprised of conventional front wheels and steering. It was designed to allow you to fit the wheel with skins. He applied this system to several different cards including the Rolls-Royce and Packard trucks. This device was far from being a snowmobile, but it certainly may have paved the way for the modern snowmobile concept.Ray Muscott obtained the first United States patent for a snow-driven vehicle with a rear track and front skies. Muscott obtained his patent on June 27, 1916 after which many individuals began modifying Model T Fords by replacing the undercarriage with tracks and skis based on Muscott’s design. These devices were extremely popular for delivering mail to rural areas where snow and ice made driving conventional vehicles treacherous when roads were covered with ice or snow.The converted Model T fords were great for travel through the dry snow conditions that existed in the Midwestern part of the United States. Unfortunately they were not suitable for areas with humid snow such as in Southern Quebec and New England. This problem created the need for another type of caterpillar track system that would be suitable for both wet and dry snow. Joseph-Armand Bombardier of Quebec, Canada had designed some metal tracked vehicles, but the invention of a track traction system that consisted of rubber covered toothed wheel with a rubber and cotton track that wrapped around the back wheels was his first major contribution.Bombardier’s invention consisted of producing a large enclosed snowmobile that was able to seat seven people comfortably. This model was called the B-7 and first appeared on the market in 1937 and was followed by the B-12 in 1942. While the B-7 had a Ford V-8 flathead engine, the B-12 had an in line six cylinder Chrysler engine. A total of 2,817 units of the B-12 were produced between 1942 and 1951 and were used to produce many different vehicles including ambulances, Canadian mail vehicles, school buses that operated during the winter months, forestry machines. This model was even used for army vehicles during World War II.",
Poetry,"Poetry Information  Introduction Poetry is a form of literary art in which language is used for its aesthetic and evocative qualities in addition to, or in lieu of, its apparent meaning. Poetry is a great tool where one can expand on one’s own ideas. It enables the writer to express their thoughts in a unique and attractive way. When looking at poetry, there are many forms which a writer can use to model his poetry around. These forms vary from one form to another in many different ways. Each form has its own set of rules from a rambling sonnet to a short and precise haiku. They each present a different outlook on how one chooses to express his ideas. 
Some Definitions Some of what is about to be discussed includes quite a bit of technical terms. To help the beginner navigate this article, here are some quick definitions. 

The generally accepted names for some of the most commonly used kinds of feet include: 

- iamb – one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable 

- trochee – one stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable 

- dactyl – one stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables 

- anapest – two unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable 

- spondee – two stressed syllables together 

The number of metrical feet in a line are described in Greek terminology as follows: 

- dimeter – two feet 

- trimeter – three feet 

- tetrameter – four feet 

- pentameter – five feet 

- hexameter – six feet 

- heptameter – seven feet 

- octameter – eight feet 
Terminology Assonance- the use of the same vowel sound with different consonants or the same consonant with different vowels in successive words or stressed syllables, as in a line of verse. i.e. mystery- mastery 

Alliteration- two or more words in succession beginning with the same sound. i.e. Precariously perched pigeon. 

Consonance- the use of the repetition of consonants or consonant patterns as a rhyming device. i.e. came, home, time. 

Onomatopoeia- The formation of a word which is also a sound, such as BOOM! 

Rhyme- Identical sound in some part of a word, i.e. cat-hat. 

Symbolism- The practice of representing things through symbols. The raven in Poe’s The Raven is a symbol. 
Elements Another thing to consider is the elements involved with writing poetry. For instance, one should consider the rhythm and meter of the poem they are writing. As well as whether you wish for there to be a rhyming scheme involved. Many different terms are used in the English language which can help a person when they are creating a new work of poetry. If you want to improve the text when you write poetry then you should familiarize yourself with some of the terms. At the very least, you will increase your knowledge and vocabulary of literature. Some of the more often seen and recognized elements are as follows: 
Tips For Beginners When writing poetry, one must first realize it is an art form. Not every poem is going to be like the one before it. The great thing about writing poetry is that it is completely yours- a poet’s success in not deposited in the bank account. It is in the ability to create something that has the ability to speak to the reader. The poet may choose the subject and frame the poem to the content. Poetry is a way of free expression. It allows the author to put his ideas in a form which comes with a sense of order and rhythm. People will remember an image long after they’ve forgotten why it was there. In it, there is a sense of refinement to what may before have just been an idea. It leaves one with a sense of beauty and reason. 

• Decide on the subject you wish to write about. Start with a familiar subject and then go on to some obscure subjects to which you have previously never given much thought. 

• Think about something special or unique to the subject 

• List some descriptive words which may provide some clear information to the reader 

• Try to create pictures in the reader`s mind - your aim is to fire the imagination 

• Express your feelings 

• Convey your feelings by the tone of your poetry 

• Bind the words and ideas together. Connect them by the use of rhyme which will provide your poetry with the element of repetition of identical or related sounds 

• Get some rhythm into your poetry - the number of lines and your choice of poetry form will help you with this. 

• Visual patterns - does your written poetry create a good pattern on the page? 

• Patterns of Sound - using alliteration, assonance and onomatopoeia can create sound effects. 

• Read your poetry to a friend 

• If you receive some constructive criticism don`t be afraid to change your poetry accordingly 

• Enjoy yourself - Writing poetry should be fun! 

If you are sitting at your desk staring at a blank sheet of paper trying to force poetry to be written, stop. Writing poetry as a hobby should not be a mindless task which you do just to say that you have actually written a poem. It should be a process of love which stems from some sort of creativity. If you are having trouble being inspired, get up and experience life. The best poetry is written about something one has true feelings about whether good or bad. Write about what you are feeling at that moment. It does not have to be something which others have written before. Be different. Try writing about something abstract such as hope or the feeling of failure. Describe the things around you in a new and inventive way. 

Writing poetry is a wonderful way to share views and opinions with others, but an uninformed poet may not be able to reach his or her audience without some guidance. 

It can take a lifetime to create something worthwhile, especially without guidance. There is no law governing who the poet can be, perhaps the mechanic down the street moonlights as a poet or maybe the clerk at the grocery store is really an aspiring poet. The point is that with the proper guidance, anyone can be a successful poet. 

It may be frustrating, but sitting down with a pen and paper or in front of a computer does not mean that vibrant verse will automatically pour onto the blank page. That is not how inspiration works. So, be prepared by always carrying a notebook and paper or laptop. 

This way if inspiration strikes while stuck in a traffic jam or during a night out on the town, the potential poem doesn`t get forgotten. Inspiration likes to strike during inconvenient times and when the writer is always prepared, the ideas always get recorded. Not every poem will be a winner, but that doesn`t mean it needs to go into the recycle bin. Be sure to keep copies of everything. What seems terrible now may not seem terrible tomorrow. Bad ideas may also wind up priming the pump and helping the poet churn out something truly amazing. 

It`s best to tackle a subject that hasn`t already been explored, but since poetry has been around a very long time, this may be difficult. So, instead try looking at a tried and true concept in a new and exciting way. 

Not everyone wants to read tired metaphors about love and longing. Instead of “waxing poetic” about your surroundings, make them personal. The story of heartbreak has been told for centuries, but your story hasn’t been told. Make sure to be inventive when writing- keep the reader’s interest- topics that have been written about death still have life in them- it is the poet’s job to find it. 

Contrary to what anyone’s third grade teacher said, poetry doesn’t need to rhyme! Actually, only those who have practiced rhyme and have experience in poetry writing, should try to rhyme. If creating a rhyming poem is something that just has to be done, then do some research about rhyming and rhyming words? Do not force it just to make something fit. If it will not work, then try to think of a new way to phrase what it is to be said. 

As to using those adjectives and adverbs to create the perfect description- there can be too much of a good thing. The reader wants to be there in the poem with the writer, but they don’t want to get lost in the color of the trees when it is the person walking along the path that they should be paying attention to. 

Try to remember that this, like everything, requires practice. E.E. Cummings didn’t succeed in his first try- don’t expect to be successful right out of the gate. Hang in there! Practice your craft and master it. If a mental block comes along, wait it out. Sometimes, it can be weeks before it will lift and the creative juices start to flow again. While this is corny, it is true- if you believe you are going to fail, you are right. Practice to succeed. 

Do not try to conform your poetry to the likes of what has been written before you. It has been written previously. It has already been done and been completed. Do things your own way. Poetry is about how you feel, not how others think you should feel. It is a chance to allow you to think about things in a way different from the ordinary. You are allowing yourself the chance to form new opinions and thoughts by constructing your view in a variation from what has always been done. It is a chance to show how you truly feel on a subject. 

There are benefits to writing poetry other than just a form of creative expression. It gives the poets a chance to put on paper how they view what is happening in their world. This may allow them to see things in a way they never did previously. The mere conveyance of one`s thoughts to paper often brings new epiphanies and even revision to already formed views. It is also a chance to clarify one’s mind. To take all that has happened in a day and moves it to another source. Some people need this at the end of the day to process what has happened previously, giving them a better outlook on life. 
Some Famous Poems Sometimes, it takes exposure to a form a genre to be able to express it effectively. Here are some famous poems from different genres to help the new poetry writer. 

The Raven by Edgar Allen Poe 

Where the Sidewalk Ends by Shel Silverstein 

The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost 

Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night by Dylan Thomas 

O Captain! My Captain! by Walt Whitman 

Dream Deferred by Langston Hughes 

I carry your heart with me by E.E. Cummings 

The Charge of the Light Brigade by Lord Alfred Tennyson 

The New Kid on the Block by Jack Prelutsky 

Touched By An Angel by Maya Angelou 

There Is Another Sky by Emily Dickinson 

There is one more bit of poetry to introduce that has become wildly popular, particularly with teenage girls. It is narrative poetry in book form, all of which tell a full story by author Ellen Hopkins. The titles are Crank, Identical, Glass, Tricks, Burned, Fallout and Impulse. They deal with controversial issues such as drug abuse, molestation, and teen pregnancy. They are extremely graphic in nature but they do what good poetry is supposed to do. They take the reader down the road the poet decided to take them. Three of the books, Crank, Glass and Fallout are semi-autobiographical, loosely telling the story of her daughter’s drug abuse. 
Conclusion The benefits of poetry are communication, self expression, differentiation, unification, therapy, and self-assertion. All the rules that apply in waking life are thrown out the window. A writer can capture an entire generation or era in a single line of poetry. Poetry can cover emotion, history, relationships, logic, learning, and myriad other things. Poetry can help one to escape- ask anyone who has been incarcerated for a long period of time. Poetry can become money. Poetry can become a family heirloom. Poetry has no bounds, like the universe or love. Poetry has limitations in traditions, but in theory there are no rules.",
Hang Gliding,"Hang Gliding Information  Introduction Hang gliding is one of those incredible activities that allows a person the freedom to soar high over the world and enjoy the views, the freedom, and the inherent wonder that comes with this incredible hobby. Hang gliding has evolved through the years and become a formidable sport activity, with thousands of die-hard hang gliders taking to the cliffs and hilltops across the world every year in search of that perfect ride. 

Hang gliding isn’t ideal for every day and is dependent on weather, especially the prevailing winds. Many locations near oceans and other massive waterways, where the wind is constantly rolling in from generally one direction, coupled with the high elevations that can be found hovering over the beaches, such as along the California and Oregon coasts, are ideal for hang gliding and attract thousands of avid enthusiasts from all around the world. 

What attracts so many people to the sport of hang gliding is likely rooted in ancient tradition. Mankind is a land animal and throughout its history, men, and women, have looked to the skies with admiration and envy as birds would circle endlessly, seeming to merely enjoy the act of floating on the wind. As a result, mankind strived for millennia to figure out a way to match the bird’s movements and share some of that wonder and splendor, at least for a while. The result is known as the common hang glider. 

Hang gliding isn’t something that a person can simply pick and do; it requires skills that can be developed over time. Without the proper set of skills, and the right equipment, a person can subject themselves to possible injury or worse. They can also subject those around them to danger without even realizing it. 

Hang gliding can be learned by just about anyone. Even paraplegics are known the hang glide, feeling the weight of their infirm legs proverbially lifted away from their conscience. The feeling of freedom is intoxicating and understanding this incredible adventure can go a long way toward appreciating it and becoming adept at hang gliding. 

Hang gliding does require some financial resources, from lessons to the equipment itself, but in life, most things do. The wonderful thing about hang gliding is that the glider itself can be dismantled and carried around without a tremendous amount of effort. All one really needs is a car, and the desire to take up this sport. 
Getting Off The Ground A hang glider will generate its lift off the ground through different means, depending on where a person is located. The common source of lift for a hang glider is from thermals. This is where the sun heats of the ground and, in turn, the hot air rises, creating an up draft of wind current. These columns are known as thermals. 

Experienced hang gliding pilots can recognize land configurations that will generate thermals and use them to their advantage, allowing them to sail higher, farther, and longer. Also, experience hang glider pilots have the potential to stay airborne for hours simply relying on the natural energy that surrounds them at the right time. 

Inexperienced hang glider pilots will likely have much shorter flights. 

Another source of lift for hang gliders is known as the Ridge lift. This is when wind meets a mountainside, or a cliff. The wind that is moving steadily toward the mountain will hit the immovable object and be forced to change its direction, usually straight up. The lift generated by these winds can be intense and hang gliders that use ridge lifts also refer to them as a soaring slope. 

Mountains can also create what are known as lee waves, which is essentially a pattern of rising and falling air, much like that found in the ocean. An experienced hang glider pilot can manipulate his craft through these lee waves and remain aloft for a long period of time. 

The last type of lift that hang gliders rely on is called convergence. With convergence, two different air masses press against one another, bringing wind in one general direction. This is also known as a sea-breeze front. There are certainly other forms of lift that hang gliders use to become airborne and to stay there, but these four are the main ones. 
Safety of Hang Gliding As with just about any recreational activity, hang gliding is as safe as you allow it. With the proper training and equipment, you can enjoy a lifetime of hang gliding across the country. The key is to remain honest with yourself and others about your skill levels, as you move from one level to the next, and your comfort zone. 

Some people feel pressured into extending themselves beyond their comfort level and this is the best recipe for getting into a dangerous and troublesome situation. At no point should anyone feel as though they need to do more than they are trained or prepared to do. 
Getting Started: Learning the Ropes Learning to hang glide is a process and requires the guidance of skilled experts. Some people will learn from friends or family members, such as parents, but for those who don’t have these experienced resources available, it’s best to stick with a certified hang gliding pilot. 

There are many hang gliding schools throughout the country and around the world that will supply, for a nominal fee, hang gliders for training. They will teach you the basics of lift and controlling the hang glider. The more you seek out these types of instruction, the safer you will be in the long run.  
Taking off When you’re ready to take your first flight in a hang glider, don’t expect to actually get off the ground. At least not in any significantly measurable way. Most instruction includes simply skimming one’s feet across the ground to get the feel for how the hang glider feels as well as how your body feels to be in the harness. 

In time, when you’re more comfortable with these maneuvers, then you will be ready to get some air under you. There are those instructors who will fly tandem with their students, just as an airplane pilot learns to fly a plane. However your instructor chooses to perform his or her duties, don’t question them, but rather absorb all of the details from the lift to turning to landing. 
First Solo Flights When you take lessons and get the handle on hang gliding, then you are likely ready to take your first solo flight with your very own hang glider. The key here is to not allow yourself to get in over your head, and not to extend yourself beyond your abilities or your comfort zone. 

There will be many temptations with hang gliding, from soaring higher and farther away than you may be ready for. If you plan on gliding with another person or in a group, make sure that they understand your limitations and ensure that they won’t take you beyond your ability to handle. 

It’s easy for people to forget or not be able to empathize with someone just starting out, especially when that person has hundreds of hours of flight time under his or her belt. When this happens, they may inadvertently go beyond a comfortable range. 

While this may not seem like much of an issue, if the person without experience begins to panic, then things can begin to go terribly wrong. 
What Equipment Does One Need to Hang Glide? Hang gliding can be considered a relatively expensive sport, or hobby, as most hang gliders cost between $3,600 US and $5,000 US. It’s important to have a quality hang glider and if you are not sure about the condition of the hang glider, if it’s used, then the safest best would be to purchase a new one. 

UV rays from the sun as well as wind can wreak havoc on hang gliders and the fabric that they are made from. Over time, these materials can deteriorate, often invisibly so, to the point where they are no longer safe. 

When in doubt, buy new. 

Some pilots also prefer to use a two-way radio to communicate with fellow pilots as well as with the ground, if there are people traveling with them. Also, a variometer is a common item to have. A variometer tells you whether or not your are going up or down and how fast. When you are in the air and thousands of feet up above the ground, it can be difficult to know whether you are rising or falling and especially how fast. This can cause some problems, especially when flying at very high altitudes. 

It’s important to note that at altitudes of 15,000 feet, which are attainable while hang gliding, the oxygen in the air becomes thinner and when there is less oxygen, the brain doesn’t function the same way. Mistakes can be made. Be sure to have the equipment you need to ensure that you remain safe at all times. 
Frequently Asked Questions Who can take part in hang gliding? Is there an age limit? Young children shouldn’t be introduced to solo hang gliding, but other than that, anyone in decent physical condition, from teens to their seventies and eighties, can hang glide. If you can jog, even slowly, with seventy pounds on your shoulders, then you can hang glide. 

Most of the time you are simply being carried in the harness, but if there is turbulence, then you will need some strength to hang on and maintain control. 

How can I find out if hang gliding is for me? Try an introductory tandem hang gliding flight. This is where you ride with a certified hang gliding instructor to get the feel for flying. That will tell you if it’s something you really want to do. 
Conclusion Hang gliding combines the best of two worlds: flying and soaring and it does so with the beauty and elegance of silent reverie. For those that hang glide, they will attest to the power and perfect simplicity in sailing in silence high above the rest of the world. 

If you’re ready to try hang gliding, make sure that you find a reputable, safe, and reliable school to learn from first.",
Capoeira,"Capoeira Information  Introduction Capoeira is one of the most unique martial arts practiced in the world today. But isn’t most martial arts little more than punching and kicking? Seems like a silly question, especially for someone who practices a martial art, but the simple answer is, yes. Where most martial arts focus on punching and kicking techniques, Capoeira is in a league of its own. The most simplistic description of Capoeira is a combination of martial arts, gymnastics, and dance. By combining music with the other aspects associated with the sport, Capoeira transcends traditional aspects of martial arts ,and actually reaches a high level of performance quality that makes this martial art more of an art form than anything else. 

Although it is an amazing martial art to train in, it is also quite difficult to find a school that teaches it. Unlike most martial arts that have become widespread, Capoeira is still fairly small in North America, but more and more schools are beginning to pop up. The other problem that students face when the opportunity presents itself is that it is a very demanding martial art to master. Complete dedication is an absolute necessities, but if new students focus on the fun aspects of music, dance, and singing associated with Capoeira, the sky is truly the limits. Before the decision to dedicate oneself to the Afro-Brazilian martial art, it is important and fascinating to explore this sport’s rich history. 
What is Capoeira? Capoeira is an Afro-Brazilian art form that combines elements of martial arts, music, and dance. It was created in Brazil by slaves from Africa by mixing the different fighting styles from their tribes, sometime after the fifteenth century. 
Start to Learn Capoeira Beginning to learn Capoeira may seem to be a daunting task at first because the reason people want to join the martial art is because of the crazy movies they see online. But the fact of the matter is that like all other things in life, you have to start at the beginning and work your way to the top one step at a time. There is no instructor in the world that will expect you to do handsprings and back flips on your first day, so you just have to relax and go with the flow. 

The first steep in learning this unique martial art is to find an instructor. Unlike other things that can be learned from books and videos, there is no possible way you can learn this martial art on your own. Sure, you can mimic some of the movements, but to truly understand the movements, you must have an instructor. A good instructor will introduce you to all the elements of Capoeira not just the movements. To understand Capoeira, you must also understand the rich history and music along with the mystery behind it all. Your first step in finding an instructor is to simply do an internet search for Capoeira and your home town. In large cities, there are typically an abundance of instructors and schools, but small towns may prove to be more difficult. 

Once you have found your instructor, it is time to start training and learning what Capoeira is that cannot be known from the outside. As a beginner, you will be overwhelmed with information at first, but with concentration and dedication, you will find the absorption of the information quite easy, but you must position yourself in such a way that you will maximize your learning. You must respect your instructor at all times despite their method of teaching or their strange rules they may have in class. Since you are beginning to build a strong bond with your instructor, it is essential to show your respect in order to build a strong foundation. 

Your method of training will go a long way to your learning of the martial art. If you truly want to learn Capoeira, it is essential to train regularly, and to also commit your body and mind to your training. By doing this you will learn and improve much faster than someone there half the time and your instructor will learn to respect you in return. More important to training hard in class is training hard outside of class. When sitting at home, there are always opportunities to watch Capoeira videos, listen to Capoeira music, practice singing Capoeira music or playing the instruments. The easiest way to train outside of class is when you don’t want to train. When you’re watching TV, movies, or playing video games, you should be stretching the entire time to increase your flexibility. By practicing on your own time, it only increases how much you learn in class and really immerses you in the world of Capoeira. 
Required Equipment The best part about learning Capoeira is there are essentially no costs associated with equipment. At most, a uniform is supplied by the instructor for a relatively low cost to the student, and at certain stages in the student’s development; a new belt is presented to the student to represent certain stages of development in the student’s skills. Like most martial arts, the student wears no shoes, but depending on the school, martial art shows may be worn on the digression of the instructor. The only other cost associated with learning Capoeira is the actual cost of the training to learn the martial art. Since the martial art is still relatively new to North America, new students will find that as new schools open to begin teaching new students, classes will be relatively inexpensive, but as class sizes and popularity grows, costs may rise accordingly. 
Capoeira in Popular Culture Since Capoeira has such a strong performance quality, it seems like its transition to film and television was in the martial art’s destiny. It didn’t take producers long to realize that the martial art is simply amazing to watch and that people would love to see it in movies and television shows. The most influential movie that featured Capoeira from beginning to end is the film Only the Strong. Although the movie was generally poor in quality, it did showcase the sport and its positive influence on its students and society. The movie basically featured out of control teens that are taught Capoeira as a last ditch effort to turn the kids straight. If it is a movie that is unknown to you, it is interesting to note that the movie was recently remade into the film Take the Lead featuring actor Antonio Bandaras and dancing instead of Capoeira. Other influences of Capoeira in movies includes Aeon Flux where Charlize Theron trained and performed Capoeira movements, many of Wesley Snipes’ action films feature Capoeira (one of the many martial arts he practices), and in the film Transformers, Jazz showcases his Capoeira for Sam when they first meet. 

It is interesting to note that for some reason or another it is usually the bad guys that are featured practicing Capoeira in television. For instance, in the famous television show Kung Fu, featuring the late David Carradine, encounters an Afro-businessman that is trained in Capoeira. The martial art first entered public consciousness in the Uk from the Nokia Mobile 2000 advertisement showing a Capoeira being practiced on a beach. Once instance where Capoeira is practiced by a good guy is in the hit kids television show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers where the character Zack, the black ranger, uses a martial art style that includes forms of dance. 

It is almost impossible to see Capoeira performed and not instantly thinkm Break Dancing! Developed in the 1970, break dancing has many analogous moves , and because many Brazilians had immigrated to the Us during this time, they would practice Capoeira in the streets that highly influenced this new dance form. Although original break dancers claim the dance form is based on kung fu films, the comparison between break dancing and Capoeira is quite apparent. 
Conclusion Capoeira is one of the most fascinating martial art in the world today, and the only reason it isn’t more popular than it currently is right now is because the fluid movements and rhythmic music looks so fantastic. There is a mistaken belief that the martial art is impossible to learn because it appears to be difficult, but in retrospect, every martial art looks difficult from the outside. After training in a martial art for days, months, years, it becomes a second nature to yourself that outsiders think is amazing yet you think it is normal. One of the most compelling reasons to join this martial art over all others is that the focus is on techniques not on using your techniques to hurt another person. In most competitions, there is little or no contact present. In one matched viewed online, one master performs a three minute handstand until his competitor mirrors the image of the first. No contact whatsoever, just skill and love for the sport. But the true fact that most people don’t understand is that every single person is capable of performing the movements, singing the songs, and playing the instruments of Capoeira because with dedication to the sport, anything becomes possible, and everything is outrageous fun.",
WoodworkingThe art of creating things out of different types of wood with the help of tools.,"Introduction to WoodworkingWoodworking can be defined as the art of creating things out of different types of wood with the help of tools. As one of the oldest crafts in the world, woodworking is used to make decorative as well as utilitarian objects.Woodworking has become a very popular hobby and a lucrative profession. The tools and materials needed for woodworking can be bought from hardware, lumber and hobby stores. Woodworkers use both hand tools and power tools to shape the wood. Woodworking can include carpentry, carving, sculpture, turning, making furniture and much more. As you can see, this could easily start as a hobby and turn into an enjoyable career if you are passionate enough to pursue it.As a hobby, woodworking can be very fulfilling and bring you several hours of recreation, along with the satisfaction of creating different things out of wood. While some people take pleasure in doing the actual woodworking, some prefer to collect beautiful works of art in wood and restoring them.Woodworking is both relaxing and exciting, particularly if you like making things. To get started, all you need are some tools, hardware and basic lessons that can help you begin. When you work with wood, you can make a variety of decorative items, items you can use and much more.Here is a history of the woodworking hobby followed by basic information you need to know to get started, including the tools you need, safety rules and tips. Getting started with woodworking Depending on what kind of woodworking you would like to take up as a hobby, such as making furniture, carving, scrolling, sculpting, turning, do it yourself fix-its around the home or restoration work, there are two ways to get started. One is to go in for a fully equipped shop. The second, and the better way is to start small and accumulate the tools you need, gradually. This is also a less expensive way to begin, since equipping a workshop can cost you thousands of dollars. Also, there are chances that you might end up adding tools you hardly use. Another thing is that one almost always buys a tool that has more than one use. For example, you can cut dados with a table saw or a router. Curves can be accomplished with a saber saw, a band saw or a scroll saw.As a beginner, therefore, consider investing in a pre cut kit that comes with the wood pre cut in the necessary sizes and shapes. All you need to do is match the parts and follow the instructions to build the item. You would most probably need to nail, screw on, glue, sand and finish the piece. Kits usually consist of parts for making bird houses, feeders, benches, holders for plants and other easy items you can make and feel proud of.When you move on to more complicated woodworking projects, you can purchase prepped up lumber in different widths. If you are making a table, table legs and chair spindles and several other pieces that need turning are available and ready for use.Go in for a simple kit at first. If you buy your project as a kit, you will get instructions and a list of tools you will need. Depending on what you plan to make, you will probably need hammers, measuring tapes, clamps, saws, square, a hand drill and chisels. This should cost you around $200 to $300. Do you need lessons? Some beginners prefer to take a few lessons before they get started with the hobby. This familiarizes them with all aspects like understanding woodworking plans, safety measures, clean up, handling tools, etc. A note about the wood you use Woodworking uses wood and that can be expensive. So when you begin your hobby, use cheaper wood such as pine, which is soft, and then poplar, which is hard. This will help you practice with soft wood first, and then hard wood when you get used to handling the tools. If you plan to work with painted projects, choose MDF or plywood like Baltic Birch which is convenient to work with.In woodworking, you also need to be aware of the nature of wood. You probably know that wood tends to change with weather conditions. It can expand or shrink, twist, warp or cup from its internal stress. It takes experience to look at a board and identify where these stresses are located and how they can affect the board when it is exposed to changes in weather. You will need to know and understand the right type of wood for your project.",https://www.discoverahobby.com/woodworking#
Sign Language,"Sign Language Information Intro Communication is an integral part of our lives. By and large we use verbal communication. But there’s another language that is the third most used language in the US- and it is not spoken. It is sign language – a natural language that uses gestures to form the words we use to speak. American Sign Language or ASL is a beautiful way to communicate. Just imagine being able to communicate with gestures as well as words equally fluently. Many people are realizing that learning sign language can be a wonderful hobby that can easily turn into a high paying vocation in a variety of fields. With sign language, you can talk to someone at a distance without actually using your voice. This is the beautiful language that has been developed to an art. It is the primary language used by those who cannot hear or speak. Sign language has opened up the world for them enabling them contribute to society regardless of their so-called handicap. Sign language is from the perspective of the viewer rather than the person who ‘speaks’. Here facial expression, how you use your eyebrows, raising or lowering them and body language are part of the language. These give emphasis to what you intend to convey. When we speak, we use vowels and consonants. In sign language, it is the shapes of the hand, where you place your hand and the movements of your hand. While it is easy to learn sign language, you will find some specific nuances that are country or race specific. For example, what holds good in British sign language could differ from the sign language used in another country. In terms of variation, different signs could be used for the same word in different areas. Some signs could be specific to males while some could be for females. Similarly, young kids could be using some signs while older people use certain signs.  American Sign Language Alphabet   How To Learn Sign Language One of the best ways to get started with learning sign language is to learn from a deaf person. Many colleges offer ASL courses. You can also learn online, through subscription based websites which offer you plenty of resources in the form of the ASL dictionary and lessons. They also teach baby sign language, international sign language, using gestures and finger spelling that involve learning the alphabet in sign language. 
To work as a sign language interpreter you might have to get an associate degree with on going certification. Colleges have workshops, tele-classes and opportunities for continuing education for those on a sign language program. 
As a hobby, learning sign language has a lot of benefits. Apart from making you more sensitive to communication, you can talk to people with special needs. You can also communicate with babies long before they are able to actually speak, speeding up their progress. A major advantage of learning sign language is helping pre-verbal children to communicate their needs. 
Learning sign language could also mean a new career for you. When you travel, you break the communication barrier by being able to use gestures. Did you know you could also communicate with animals using sign language?  Baby Sign Language One adaptation of sign language that has been growing strongly is Baby Sign Language. Using simple signs (such as happy, more, food) parents can start to communicate with the baby more effectively. Studies have shown that babies can start to comprehend the signs starting around month 6-7 and they can start making the signs around month 10-11. Studies have shown that by practicing these signs with your baby, the baby can have increased linguistic development and speed of mental processing. 
What sign language interpreters do When you are well on your way to mastering sign language, you might want to work as a sign language interpreter, which is fulfilling work. Sign language interpreters are specially trained. They facilitate communication between deaf people, people who are hard of hearing and also those that can hear. You might find yourself working in the education industry or freelance. You could also be contracted with an agency to offer interpreter services. Sign language interpreters could also find work in schools and colleges. 
To truly enjoy being a sign language interpreter you would need to be a person who is flexible, objective, self disciplined and motivated. You would also need to be sensitive to others, responsible and punctual. Interpreters earn as much as $50000; depending on who they work with, how much experience they already have and where they live, they might earn $50 an hour. You can also teach the deaf and become involved in social work and counseling. Interpreters, like translators make cross cultural communication a reality. For this it is important to be sensitive to the cultures involved. Since it involves the conversion of spoken language into sign language and vice versa, the sign language interpreter must be focused on what is being said. 
If you want to become a translator, you would be converting written material from one language to the other. For this you would need to develop your analytical and writing skills along with editing skills. 
There is a big demand for sign language interpreters today since the requirement is more than the availability. You can choose to take it up as a part time or full time hobby. Here is an idea of the various situations where you can work as a sign language interpreter: 
• In educational institutions • Business situations when board meetings and seminars are held • Community settings at meetings, the local library, and interviews • etc. in short wherever deaf persons are employed • Church where funerals, weddings etc., are involved • Social service organizations • Medical hospitals and rehab centers • Legal situations which could be at the police station 
As you can see, there is a lot of scope for using your sign language skills once you become proficient at it. 
Now that you have a good idea of what it means to have a hobby that is so fulfilling and well paying at the same time, go ahead and get in depth knowledge of the subject at Discover A Hobby. Here you will find instructional videos and some very useful books that tell you all you need to know about sign language. This will help you become proficient in sign language, and who knows, you might just start off on a brand new career!",
River Rafting,"River Rafting InformationINTRODUCTIONImagine the day yawning with promise as you step toward the cool, clear running water. At the river, it’s usually calm where you start, but you know before long that serenity, that calmness, will be replaced by a thrill that few other things in nature can match. River rafting has been a part of cultures for thousands of years and while for a majority of these years it was about survival, river rafting in today’s culture is about the thrill of excitement, embracing nature and all the power it holds within it, and being out among the open air, listening to the deafening roar of that power all around you.When people tend to think of river rafting, they have visions of whitewater rapids, of a washing machine type of rolls of the water crashing over and around rocks, smashing everything that comes near it into oblivion. But this is only one image of river rafting. There are many levels and grades of river rafting, many that don’t actually produce any whitewater, but still offer the peaceful serenity and occasional excitement that comes from drifting down a river in the middle of a glorious afternoon.Hundreds of years ago, river rafting was a necessity of survival, carrying traders to different towns and villages to earn a living. It also connected different tribes of people to each other, opened up a world of opportunity, and posed some critical challenges of survival. For millions of people around the world, there is a lure about water that tends to draw them close to it, whether it’s to the ocean to feel the waves splash against the ankles, or to lakes to enjoy an afternoon swim, or to the rivers to enjoy the constant power and presence that is the core of nature.Rivers have carved out some of the most breathtaking scenery in the entire world, from canyons and ravines to inlets and capillaries that make up our modern civilization. It’s natural to want to be surrounded by this power, to be a part of it, and to share in its glory, if only for a few minutes, or hours, at a time.River rafting simply offers an experience of a lifetime for anyone willing to take the chance. The unique aspect about river rafting that separates it from all other forms of outdoor adventure is that it is open to anyone and everyone. You don’t need to succumb to the pressures of Grade 6 rapids –those harsh, nearly un-navigable rivers- to enjoy river rafting. No, there are numerous Grade 1 rapids that one could even float down in a tube, just to bask in the glory of nature surrounding them.If you have ever wondered just what it would be like to river raft, then you’re already on your way to experiencing the thrill of a lifetime.
HISTORYRiver rafting has been around for a long time, though it became intensely popular as a recreational activity during the nineteen-eighties. While many people tend to think of river rafting as the intense, thrill-seeking adventure, the majority of the river rafting excursions that are popular involve minimal impact and are incredibly safe.Men and women have attempted to navigate almost every river and every section of every river that exists throughout the world. Some rivers are quite still and calm and barely bristle with any movement and instead act more like lakes than rivers while others fall at steep grades, conjuring up rolling water that can swallow an entire boat, shatter it or tear it to shreds, and then hide most of the evidence.It is believed that the rubber river raft, the predecessor to today’s modern river rafts, was invented in the 1840s by Lieutenant John Fremont. The intent of this invention was to explore the Rocky Mountain region as well as the Great Plains. Beyond that, the first commercial river rafting trip occurred at the turn of the century. Of course, in the beginning, military surplus rafts were the choice of professional whitewater trips and the inflatable rubber rafts came along as a reliable alternative much later.As with most inventions and expansions of business throughout the twentieth centuries, it was the private enterprise that altered the face of river rafting, as a business, in the mid part of the century. John D. Rockefeller, one of the most notable names in business throughout the twentieth century, built a resort that introduced floating trips down river. It was the first of its kind in the country, but it didn’t meet with the reception that Rockefeller apparently had hoped it would. By the time the nineteen-sixties and nineteen-seventies rolled around, whitewater rafting companies began to form and take shape. These were exclusive companies that catered to an elite population. Some of these earliest companies included Becker-Cooke Expeditions and Slickrock Adventures.In its earliest days as a commercial enterprise, river rafting offered the thrill of excitement amongst the power of nature and this attractive a number of people to its daring and heart-pounding thrills. It is arguable that other factors also led to its rise in popularity, including the constant attempts of some high-flying adventurers to tumble over the falls at Niagara, New York.People have constantly been in search of greater thrills when it comes to the outdoors. The greater the thrill, the higher the adrenaline rush that a person gets and the toughest rapids in the country provide some of the most intense thrills. River rafting is, for the most part, unlike any other sport or recreational activity in that a person can navigate the same grade 5 or grade 2 rapids day in and day out, but the risk remains the same, regardless of the experience level.The popularity of river rafting took off in the nineteen-eighties, thanks in large part to its inclusion as a sport in the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972. It has since been featured in a number of movies, including The River Wild, and more Olympic competitions, including 1992 in Barcelona and 1996 in Atlanta.River rafting has taken on a life of its own and with the safety equipment, new technology of rafts, helmets, life vests, GPS navigation, and more, it has become even more accessible and enjoyable for people of almost all ages and all walks of life.
GRADES OF WATERThe ranking system is designed to give rafters an idea what to expect before setting out on a trip. Sections of a river can have multiple ratings resulting in a range. This will indicate the extremes of what that section has to offer.Class 1This is an indication of a very calm section of water. There may be a minor degree of paddling. Examples of this may include a slight bend in the river. This is the perfect level for socializing and relaxation.This is the type of classification when your main goal has more to do with enjoying the view. The skill level required is minimal which makes it perfect for everyone in the family.Class 2In this classification the speed of the water has increased. There may be a few minor obstacles and rocks in your way. This may mean you have slightly more paddling to do. This level will require you to be generally aware of your surroundings.There is still little to no danger in this class. It is also probably the highest level that first time rafters should face. It allows for a decent amount of practice with the paddle and can build up needed arm strength for more challenging classes.Class 3Water at this speed can actually be classified as white water. This means the spray and disturbance in the water forms white foam. There will be rocks and possibly a dip or two.At this level it is recommended to have people experienced in paddling. The danger posed is not great, but it will definitely soak you.Class 4Here the white water gets rougher. The waves you encounter go from small to medium. There will definitely be rocks and drops to get the heart pounding.Advanced rafters should only attempt this level. A strong team will be needed to work effectively and avoid the obstacles.Class 5This is the highest level that most rafters will ever attempt. The waves have now progressed to being high. The rocks are bigger and the drops are farther.This is a dangerous level even for experienced rafters. Only with an expert team should this be attempted.Class 6A class 6 section of water is pretty much telling people not to try it. However, this does not stop some people. This classification says that the passage is unmanageable. You can’t navigate it.Those who attempt it are either fools or the best in the world. Usually people will say they are both. Bodily injury is almost assured. There is also a high probability of death.
WHAT TO DO
Paddle SignalsWhen you are rafting in a group of rafts, there are many occasions to communicate between rafts. Many guides will instruct you on all the signals you’ll need to know. However, you can make sure that a few basics are covered.When covering these signals it is good to do so before you’re on the water. If you wait the need for one of the signals may arise before you have learned it. The following are examples of some of the most basic signals. As seen, there can be multiple ways to signal the same thing. This difference may occur between different outfitters.
StartEvery raft in the group needs to show readiness. If you don’t you may start before all the gear has been packed. This can be important gear like a first aid kit or slightly less important like someone’s sun block.Whatever the case, it is important to make sure that everyone is ready for the trip. There’s nothing more inconvenient when someone needs to use the bathroom and they couldn’t because other rafters just couldn’t wait to see if everyone was ready. This is especially troubling when that someone is you.To execute this move hold your paddle straight up in the air. Remember to shake excess water off before signaling. Eventually you will get wet, but you don’t have to start your trip already soaked.For some outfitters a fist raised in the air can serve the same purpose. Whatever the signal is make sure that all agree how to read it. You don’t need every raft responding differently to a command that means one thing.
All StopOn occasion you may need to stop for any number of reasons. That person who didn’t go to the restroom can’t hold it any more and needs to pop into the woods for some relief. This may be embarrassing, but it could be dangerous if your group gets completely separated. Therefore this command is helpful.To execute this move hold your paddle above your head. Grip the paddle in the middle so it forms a T shape. This is often referred to as holding your paddle across the river.The other way to give the same signal without the paddle is to hold your arms straight out. In this maneuver, your whole body forms the T shape. This is necessary for the times when you’ve lost your paddle. If this happens to you it is easy to see the value in stopping.
Trouble or HelpSafety is a major concern in any sport. Many times something unexpected will happen while rafting. When emergencies like this happen you will need to inform everyone in the group.This move involves holding the paddle above your head and making a swirling motion. This signifies that all the rafts should gather up and assist. This is probably one of the most important signals.
Okay StatusWith many higher level forms of rafting something unexpected is very likely to happen. The event may involve a serious exchange with the river or sudden collision with something.

If injury does occur you should use the trouble or help signal. However, sometimes it just looks bad. In these cases your team may need a moment to regain their bearings. This is when you need to give the okay signal.This tells the others in the group that there are no problems and that they can continue.This signal involves putting your paddle across your lap. Then you raise your arms above your head to form an O. This signal is often done when you reach calmer waters since relinquishing your paddle could get dicey in rougher conditions.
PointingThis is an especially useful signal when there are bends or side channels to a river. The twists in the river may cut off vision from the entire group. This will cut vision down to only a raft or two in front and one in back.When this happens, the raft in the lead will need to indicate which direction to go in. That way the message can be relayed to all the rafts no matter the terrain limitations.This signal is probably the most simple. Raise your paddle and point where you are planning to go. The only thing to keep an eye out for is never point at an obstruction in the water with your paddle. If you do you will be instructing the following rafts right into it.
 EQUIPMENT NEEDED FOR RIVER RAFTINGPerhaps the best thing about river rafting in the twenty-first century is that one doesn’t need to own any equipment to take part in a thrilling adventure down the rapids of a river. Nearly every professional, commercial river rafting expedition company throughout the country has its own fleet of rafts, life vests, helmets, guides, and instruction so that you can simply tag along for the ride, hang on, and let the spirit of excitement and adventure take over.There are those die-hard thrill seekers, though, who prefer to tame the roaring rapids on their own, and while they have most likely been taking trips down river for many years, anyone can set out on their own adventure, at least on the lower grade rapids, with the most basic equipment.The first and most important thing that anyone will need is a life vest. Unlike many boating trips that people take across lakes and down gently flowing rivers, life vests on any river rapid trip should be worn at all times. Even the tamest of rapids can pose some threat of capsizing the boat, tossing the person into the water, and when the river is flowing, it can pull a person downstream quite quickly. It doesn’t matter whether this individual has great swimming prowess or not, anything can happen on a river.A person can slip out of the raft and hit his or her head on a jutting rock. He or she could be tangled in branches or debris or have their wrist tangled in the rope that runs along the edge of the raft (for hanging onto). Always wear a life vest.The next thing every river rafting person should have is a helmet. This is in case they are tossed overboard, or encounter strong rapids that toss the raft around. Rocks are commonplace in rivers. So are branches floating by. One minor concussion to the head can cause temporary blindness, or knock a person unconscious. It’s simply not worth the risk to take. Wear a helmet.The last thing a person needs is a raft. Ideally, the raft that one chooses should be large enough to hold two to four people and you should never head out onto the rapids alone. Even the most experienced river rafting experts prefer to head downriver with at least one other person.Oars are essential to navigating the rapids successfully. These oars should be plastic composite, designed to withstand intense forces, be able to float, and they will likely be short. These oars are unlike the oars of rowboats in that their purpose isn’t to propel the craft through the water, which is what the river’s flow does naturally, but to steer or guide the raft to certain sides of the river.
 HOW TO START THE RIVER RAFTING EXPERIENCEIn nearly every part of the country, there are rivers. Some are more intense than others, but rarely will one be unable to find quality rapids to begin their river rafting experience. The first thing that one needs to do in order to enjoy river rafting is to contact a local river rafting company and sign up for a trip downstream.Think small. Begin small. Someone who has never taken part in a grade 4 or grade 5 rapids trip will not only find the experience terrifying, although most likely thrilling at the same time, they will be a liability to the other individuals in the raft. Experience matters on the water and you will likely find much more enjoyment if you focus on taking is slow and start out with the tamer rapids first.When you find that river rafting is ideal for you and your adventurous spirit, then you can inquire about higher grade rapids. Different companies will have different policies about grades of rapids, so you may have to call around to several companies before finding one that will take you where you want to go.One note of importance: If you ever plan on tackling rapids on your own, or ideally with another experienced river rafting friend, many national and state parks prohibit river rafting in certain, treacherous regions of the river. Taking part in a trip downstream could result in arrest for trespassing. This is usually the case when the rapids, or the underlying factors, such as depth of water, drop-offs, or flood induced debris makes it dangerous for anyone to navigate.
 TYPES OF OBSTACLESThe following are descriptions of types of obsticles you`ll find while rafting. Many of these are only found in higher classes or grades of water conditions.StrainersStrainers are formed when an object blocks the passage of larger objects but allows the flow of water to continue - like a big food strainer or colander. These objects can be very dangerous, because the force of the water will pin an object or body against the strainer and then pile up, pushing it down under water. For a person caught in this position, it will be difficult or impossible to get to safety, often leading to fatal outcome.Strainers are formed by many different natural or man-made objects, like storm grates over tunnels, trees that have fallen into a river (""log jam""), bushes by the side of the river that are flooded during high water, wire fence, rebar from broken concrete structures in the water, or other debris. Strainers occur naturally most often on the outside curves of rivers where the current undermines the shore exposing the roots of trees and causing them to fall into the river forming strainers.In an emergency it is often best to try and climb on top of a strainer so as not to be pinned against the object under the water. If you are in a river, swimming aggressively away from the strainer and into the main channel is your best bet. If you cannot avoid the strainer, you should swim hard towards it and try to get as much of your body up and over it as possible.SweepersSweepers are trees fallen in or heavily leaning over the river, still rooted on the shore and not fully submerged. Its trunk and branches may form an obstruction in the river like strainers. Since it is an obstruction from above, it often does not contribute to whitewater features but may create turbulence. In fast water sweepers can pose a serious hazard to paddlers.HolesHoles, or ""hydraulics"", (also known as ""stoppers"" or ""souse-holes""), are formed when water pours over the top of a submerged object, causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object. Holes can be particularly dangerous—a boater may become stuck in the recirculating water—or entertaining playspots, where paddlers use the holes` features to perform various playboating moves. In high-volume water, holes dramatically aerate the water, possibly to the point where it may even lose the capacity to carry any water craft.Some of the most dangerous types of holes are formed by lowhead dams (weirs), underwater ledges, and similar types of obstruction. In lowhead dams, the hole has a very symmetrical character - there`s no weak point - and where the sides of the hydraulic are often blocked by a man-made wall, making it impossible to slip off the side of the hydraulic.[clarification needed] Lowhead dams are insidiously dangerous because their danger cannot be easily recognized by people who have not studied whitewater.WavesWaves are formed in a similar nature to hydraulics and are sometimes also considered hydraulics as well. Waves are noted by the large smooth face on the water rushing down. Sometimes a particularly large wave will also be followed by a ""wave train"", a long series of waves. These standing waves can be smooth or, particularly the larger ones, can be breaking waves (also called ""whitecaps"" or ""haystacks"").Because of the rough and random pattern of a riverbed, waves are often not perpendicular to the river`s current. This makes them challenging for boaters since a strong sideways or diagonal (also called "" a lateral"") wave can throw the craft off.In fluid mechanics, waves are classified as laminar, but the whitewater world has also included waves with turbulence (""breaking waves"") under the general heading of waves.PillowsPillows are formed when a large flow of water runs into a large obstruction, causing water to ""pile up"" or ""boil"" against the face of the obstruction. Pillows can be dangerous because sometimes the object that forms the pillow is undercut and so paddlers can be swept underwater - possibly to be entrapped. Pillows are also known as ""pressure waves"".EddiesEddies are formed, like hydraulics, on the downstream face of an obstruction. Unlike hydraulics, eddies swirl on the horizontal surface of the water. Typically, they are calm spots where the downward movement of water is partially or fully arrested - a nice place to rest or to make one`s way upstream. However, in very powerful water, eddies can have powerful, swirling currents which can flip boats and from which escape can be very difficult.Undercut RocksUndercut rocks are rocks that have been worn down underneath the surface by the river, or loose boulders which cantilever out beyond their resting spots on the riverbed. They can be extremely dangerous features of a rapid because a person can get trapped underneath them underwater. This is especially true of rocks that are undercut on the upstream side. Here, a boater may become pinned against the rock underwater. Many whitewater deaths have occurred in this fashion. Undercuts sometimes have pillows, but other times the water just flows smoothly under them, which can indicate that the rock is undercut. Undercuts are most common in rivers where the riverbed cuts through sedimentary rocks like limestone rather than igneous rock like granite. In a steep canyon, the side walls of the canyon can also be undercut.A particularly notorious undercut rock is Dimple Rock, in Dimple Rapid on the Lower Youghiogheny River in Pennsylvania. Nine people have died here, including three in 2000.SievesAnother major whitewater feature is a sieve, which is a narrow empty space that water flows through between two obstructions, usually rocks. Similar to strainers, water is forced through the sieve, resulting in higher pressures which forces water up and creates turbulence.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSIs it safe?Under the right guidance, river rafting has become an incredibly safe adventure. For those who take it into their own hands, then safety becomes a secondary consideration. Always seek out experienced professionals for your river rafting experience.Do I need to be able to swim?No, though it helps with one’s comfort level on the water. Life vests keep you afloat, should you –in the rare event- go overboard. Most of the time, though, you never actually have to enter the water.
CONCLUSIONRiver rafting has become a popular and exhilarating experience for millions of people every year. Setting out on the river with the expectation of thrills and excitement, of enjoying the peaceful serenity and wonder that nature offers as you gently float downriver, knowing soon enough that you will encounter rougher water, rolling currents, and that these will toss your boat around, try to bounce you from the raft, and make you hold on tight, is enough to attract most adventurous spirits.Even for those who have less of an adventurous side to them, river rafting on lower graded rapids, such as grades 1 or grades 2, simply offers the wonder of a world that can often be forgotten in our hustle and bustle world, the fast-paced life that many of us have become accustomed to. River rafting can bring us back –if only briefly- to our childhood wonder and awe of the world around us.",
Robotics,"Robotics Information  Introduction Over the course of the past sixty years, technology has been growing at an alarming rate. With that technology, the advancement of robots, mechanical machines, have began to also increase at the same rate. Although the idea of creating a robot sounds difficult, the fact of the matter is that anyone who is willing to dedicate their time to the hobby can make a robot of their very own. The fact is that the hobby of robot building has been around for many years now, and as the tools and equipment have been upgraded over the years, the hobby is now easier for new people to join the fascinating hobby. 

The problem with the hobby is that there is a lot of technical information that, although isn’t a necessity, is important to have a basic understanding of. For those new to robotics, there are numerous books and videos that can get you started in the right direction along with numerous online websites featuring step by step YouTube videos. But to fully understand how robotics evolved from its mythological roots to its modern, yet forever growing, form. By understanding the post of robotics, one can come to respect the hobby that is robotics. We will look into that topic below in the section Robots of Antiquity. 
How to get started? After looking through the history of robotics,it seems like a hobby in the field is closed to anyone who doesn’t have an advanced university degree, but the truth couldn’t be farther from the truth. The world of robots is not only fascinating and fun, it is also available for anyone interested in the hobby. It was perhaps twenty years ago that robotics was only open to scientists and engineers, but the hobby is now wide open. The world of competitive robotics grows each year with competitions ranging from remote-controlled gladiator bots to autonomous soccer robots. You don`t need academic degrees to do this kind of research and development, but you will need a push in the right direction to get started in a robotics hobby. 

The first thing new hobbyists need to decide is what sorts of robots would interest you as a hobby. The things necessary to build a battle robot for example are considerably different than what you might need to build a scientific exploration robot. Your next goal is to start assessing other robots to study their basic design. The study of robots began with the simple robot arms common in industrial applications and by combining this simple sort of programming and movement with other robotics, designers are able to build more complex machines that can detect and interact with their surroundings. You must also decide on specific functions necessary for movement, manipulation and sensation 

The next part is going to be incredibly difficult for all new hobbyists because it requires research, research, and more research. You have to grasp the basic concepts of robotics by studying different aspects physics and computer programming. Sounds like a daunting task, but there are now countless websites available that breaks down the information for laymen to understand, and only the information relevant to robotics is included. The computer programming part is also relatively easy, but it does require the learning of computer languages, but without, your robot will just by a hunk of junk. 

In the same realm of the above, you also need to learn and practice how to integrate functions using programmable microchips. Sounds like an impossibility, but with good research and lots of practice, it can all come together for you. You just have to always remember that despite the level of knowledge required for the hobby, nearly every other person in the hobby started out just like you. You just have to remember that it is always darkest at the dawn. 

Like most “howto” articles, I cannot direct you step by step in order to build a robot due to the restraints of the article itself, but I also have a hard time simply stating the phrase “Build Robot using high quality tools”. That is not useful to anyone, and it makes the task seem utterly impossible. By doing a simple website search, you will come to multiple sites that teach you step by step how to build a robot. The steps will by composes of some of the above, the less advanced the robot the less likely you will need to know physics, computer programming languages, or micro chips, but you will learn the basics by creating a very simplistic robot, but a robot none the less. There are also countless books on the subject for all levels of experience, and the same goes for DVD instruction videos. 
Basic Tools/Parts Required As your skill in robotics grows, your collection of tools will grow in both number and specification. The following is a list of recommended tools needed to build the simplest of robots. They are generic enough that they can be used for most simple robot designs. Most of these tools may be able to be found around the house otherwise they will have to be picked up from a department or specialty store. You can also purchase kits online for reasonable sums of money. Always remember that you will get what you paid for, so if you spend a bit extra, you will have longer lasting tools and parts. 

- wires - screws - screwdrivers to match screws - 1.5V batteries (rechargeable NiMH are best) - cardboard - scotch/duct tape - serial port on your computer - if no serial port, get a usb to serial adaptor cable - sharp scissors - soldering iron - solder roll (22 to 25 gauge) - multimeter (not required, but good to have) - safety goggles (you only have two eyes) 
Robots and Literature Robotic characters, androids (artificial men/women) or gynoids (artificial women), and cyborgs (humans with significant mechanical enhancements) have become a staple of science fiction. Not only are they staples in Science Fiction, some of the best stories and novels have been written about Robot that theorize and examine the human species. 

The most prolific author of stories about robots was Isaac Asimov (1920–1992), who placed robots and their interaction with human society at the center of many of most of his works. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first passage in Asimov`s short story ""Liar!"" that mentions the First Law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics. Asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to protect human life from both themselves and the nearly invincible robot artificial life, and arrived at his Three Laws of Robotics: a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; a robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. These were introduced in his 1942 short story ""Runaround"", although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. Later, Asimov added the Zeroth Law: ""A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm""; the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this. 

Another famous novel, which was later turned into a movie, is the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which is most commonly known as its movie title Blade Runner. It was in this novel that questioned whether or no artificial life was actually alive at all or just a series of random commands and prompts like that of a computer. The novel focuses around a group of rogue androids that are so near to humanity that they are indistinguishable to all but a few how must bring them to justice. By studying the human like androids, we come to learn how fragile and lost humanity truly is. 
Conclusion The hobby of robotics is one of the most difficult and demanding hobbies to get into, but the result of a homemade robot is priceless. The problem with this hobby over all others is the research one must do should they want to advance from the initial rank of beginner. Although you no longer need to be a scientist or physicist to get into a hobby like robotics, you do need to understand that basics. With the help of online instructions and videos, the goal of completing a robot is attainable. Through this course, and with supplementation of books and DVD’s, you can learn the information required to build your first robot, and from there you can build more complex robots of your own design. Since you can now purchase everything off of the internet or find it in your own home, there is nothing your imagination can think of that you can physically build. Like anything else, you have to dedicate yourself to the task at hand and practice as often as you can in order to accomplish all your goals.",
Neuro Linguistic ProgrammingA method to further develop one’s life and skills.,"Introduction to Neuro Linguistic ProgrammingNeuro linguistic programming is a new area of study and basically deals with the way in which we live our lives, the way we behave and the way we communicate. These patterns include what we think, what we do and our mental make-up. NLP also relates to our emotions and our senses. As such NLP encompasses a huge area and has its applications in a variety of fields.Simply put, we can see NLP as a method towards personal development where it is used as a tool for performance improvement. NLP also gives us a better model for effective communication both with self and others. NLP uses ‘modelling’ or creating models for human behavior. The approach has been very powerful and successful. The behavior of highly effective performers is studied after which the results are converted into easy to use techniques. These techniques are used in workshops to help people learn in a short while, what might take years otherwise.One of the biggest reasons why people are interested in NLP is because it gives the individual the ability to bring about the kind of transformation they want in their lives. NLP provides an insight into others’ way of thinking and behavior, based on which you can develop the techniques you need to make a positive change. You get the skills to run your life effectively by using your mind, body and emotions actively.The knowledge body of NLP grows continuously, constantly coming up with techniques to improve the way we think, behave and feel. Developing NLP skills gives you the ability toBe better at what you doDevelop the necessary skills and attitudes to do things you want to doDevelop clarity of thoughtCommunicate betterBe more effective at managing your thoughts, moods and behaviors The main focus of NLP is to study and understand the factors that lead to success and failure in any given situation. Understanding What NLP Is In neuro linguistic programming, ‘neuro’ relates to the brain and its network of nerve cells. These nerve cells perform the function of sending, receiving and storing signals that translate into information for the brain. ‘Linguistic’ relates to the use of language. Thus, neuro-linguistics is about how the nervous system and language influence each other. Programming means carrying out a planned sequence of actions to achieve an expected result. We can therefore define Neuro-linguistic programming as the use of language in a planned manner to get a pre-planned result.We tend to react to various things based on our past experiences and feelings. Thus two people could see the same thing; yet react totally differently to it. It depends on what kind of experience they have had in the past about this. When they process information about what they see mentally, the factors that play a role are experiences both good and bad, their opinions and value systems, etc. As a result, the interpretation of what they see can be totally different.NLP therefore seeks to find what makes top performers tick. Based on this, models are made and methods are worked out through which the same results can be achieved with average performers. So, if you wanted to, for example, find out someone’s proficiency in mental mathematics, you would need to find out how he or she does it using effective communication so that you do not lead them. Thus, effective communication skills are an essential element of NLP. The Ingredients of NLPRather than going into too much technical detail, we can summarize by saying that NLP is made up of the following ‘ingredients’: A set of beliefs that guides you on communicating with peopleA clear-cut model for questioning and listening skillsAn approach to influencing skills, language and metaphor usage that draws from the area of clinical hypnosisAn effective group of exercises that assist in behavior change in peoplePowerful techniques for rapport building NLP is mainly to do with how people do things and not the rationale behind what they do. So if someone finds it difficult to play an instrument, NLP will identify the limiting factors that are preventing the person from playing the instrument, rather than why the person is not learning. Once these limiting factors are known the next step is to get rid of them so that learning results.",https://www.discoverahobby.com/neuro-linguistic-programming#
Dogs,"Dogs Information  Introduction One of the greatest pets in the entire world is of course the dog. They are highly intelligent, loyal beyond any other animal, fun to be around, and probably the most personable pet in the entire pet industry. Not only are they simply fantastic animals, they have been human companions for thousands of years. Although they did evolve from wolves, and still are bred with wolves in some areas of North America, they are more often than not extremely kind and gentle. Due to the large number of dog breeds and mixed dog breeds, there is a virtually endless supply of choices when it comes to the breed of dog you are interested in. There are big dogs like the Irish wolfhound, small dogs like the Chihuahua, and even long dogs like the Deerhound. Every type of dog has its own type of personality, activity level, and intelligence level, but for the most part, people purchase certain breeds because of their unique look, length of fur, and of course coloration. With such a vast selection of dog breeds, there are dogs for all different types of people and of both sexes. The second you bring a dog into your life, you will finally understand the meaning of the phrase “Man’s best friend.” 
Purchasing Your First Dog The first rule about purchasing your first dog is to buy a species that is interesting to you. Never be persuaded to purchase a dog that you don’t want because you are told it is an a “better or worse” breed than another. If it is a dog that you don’t really want, then it is a pet that you will grow tired of in the future. Regardless of what type it is that you want, you have to ensure you do all the research about it prior to purchasing it so that you take proper care of your new dog from day one. There is simply no sense in getting a dog that will grow to be ten times heavier than you or purchasing a dog that needs constant exercise if you don’t have substantial time available. Activity and size should be a major factor when purchasing a new dog, but it is far too easy to fall in love when staring into puppy eyes. 

One of the most debated issues in North America right now is whether to purchase from a private breeder, a pet store, or a dog shelter. Here is an argument that is based on a few too many bad apples spoiling it for the bunch. But over the past twenty years, there have been numerous cases of poor quality puppies and dogs being sold by people thinking only of profit as their animals suffer from neglect. Thankfully, there has been numerous enthusiasts stepping forward to challenge pet stores to live up to the higher standards people expect from them and there have also been numerous pet stores in North America that have been promoting adoptions from pet shelters rather than selling dogs and puppies at all. Because of the explosion of pet dogs after the Second World War, there is a steady incline in the dog and cat population that has many people worried about the growing number of homeless and neglected pets. Although it is great if you can save a dog from a dog shelter and give it a second lease at life, there is also nothing wrong with purchasing a dog from a store or private breeder. The fact is that you will probably want a specific dog that only a breeder or store can get you so a shelter is right out. You just have to remember that pet stores purchase dogs from breeders and mark up the prices, so it would in fact be considerably cheaper purchasing a dog from a breeder. 

As a general rule of thumb, always try to purchase the healthiest dog or puppy available. This is easily done by purchasing the largest in a group that has bright eyes and is active. Larger animals typically mean that they are being well fed and cared for. With dogs, assuming they are taken care of well, will generally all be of the same size and weight when you see them in a pet store window or in a litter of puppies at a breeders residence. If a dog is skinny and not active, then it is best to leave it be. It’s far too easy to succumb to a sick dog pulling at your heart strings, but when it comes to dog illnesses, there is a steep financial cost to making a sick dog well again. A healthy animal can live many years, and if you put in the time that is necessary, you will be rewarded in the long run. 
Required Equipment The great thing about dogs and puppies is that there is virtually no equipment required to giving these little guys a great home. The only type of enclosure that most people are now purchasing their dogs is a dog kennel that acts as the animal’s den when you are away, sleeping, or when traveling with your pet. Because of their den instincts, they feel quite comfortable staying in these small cages with latchable fronts, and if you are like me, then a little blanky and a couple toys are a graciously appreciated addition. Kennels should be slightly larger than the size of the dog because if it is too large, dogs will likely want to go to the bathroom in one side and sleep in the other. For the most part, most dogs will only need one size of kennel for the majority of their life, but larger dogs, like Irish Wolfhounds, Mastiffs, and St. Bernard’s, will require frequent upsizing to their kennels as they grow from puppies to adults. Although the kennel is quite useful for training reasons, it is not a necessity in any stretch of the imagination. 

There is also a large variety of items you can purchase for you dog that are useful, but not necessarily required for their health. Dog collars are a great idea if you are planning to frequently walk you new pet, and the pets identification, like home address and phone number, can easily be attached to the collar should the dogs run away. Of course if you are planning on walking your dog, and leash is the best way to always maintain control over your pet’s actions. There is nothing worse than a wiener dog chasing a truck down the street . . .Trust me! Leashes and collars can also be purchased to match your dog’s personality like tough guy spiked collars or diamond studded collars for your little princess. In the same line of thought, there are numerous lines of clothing that you can purchase for you pets. This seems silly, and for the most part it is, but for short haired dog breeds, it is a very good idea to purchase jackets and booties for those cold winter months. The last random thing you should also buy is a food and water dish for your little dog or puppy. They will eat out of virtually anything, but it’s a good idea to have specific bowls that are for just the dog that could even match his personality. The one thing that all puppies and dogs of all ages need is a variety of toys. Not only do they need toys, but they also need a variety of different shapes, textures, and densities that will prevent them from chewing on household items. Not only will it save your television remote or your new pairs of socks, but it could actually aid them in their physical development. An example would be having cold toys that they can chew on when they are teething because it feels so good on their soar teeth. 
A Specialized Diet Most store-bought dog food comes in either a dry form (also known in the US as kibble) or a wet canned form. Popular Alternative Dog Food Labels are: Frozen or Freeze-Dried, Dehydrated, Fresh or Refrigerated, Homemade Diet, or. Vegetarian dog foods. Although dog food always has, and always will be highly debated by the numerous competing dog food companies throughout the world, the only real issue that I have with the above list is the idea of vegetarian food for dogs. The simple fact about dogs is that they are meat eaters, and in no way should they be fed a non-meat diet. This idea of dogs being vegetarian is nothing more than human owners expressing their way of life onto their pet. Unlike other people who can choose whether or not to eat in this way, dogs are entirely dependent on their human owners, so they have no choice in what they get to eat. As wild animals, there is now way that a dog would be willing to eat a patch of grass or a bush of berries instead of anther wild animal. Although on a side note, I’m sure my female wiener dog could lay in a strawberry plant eating berries all day if I let her. 

The other highly debated item in regards to dog food is the inclusion of animal byproducts into the food. A majority of lesser quality foods support the fact that animal-by-products should be in all dog foods. What is an animal-by-product? Think of a dog food that has chicken-by-product in the ingredient list, and then imagine that the whole chicken has gone into making that dog food compared to a food using chicken meal, which is only the actual meat of the chicken. The argument behind by-products is that in the wild, dogs will eat the whole animal. This of course if absolutely true, but it not necessarily good for them to eat a whole chicken. These lesser quality pet foods are misleading because if makes it seem like you are feeding your dog chicken when you are actually feeding you dogs chicken and random parts of that chicken. 

One of the best advancements in the pet food industry is the specially formulated foods for dogs allergic to common ingredients such as chicken, wheat, or corn. These foods usually contain ""novel proteins"" and substitute uncommon starches for the usual grains. Meats used in allergy formulas can range from the mundane, such as lamb, beef, or whitefish, to the unusual, such as venison or duck. Carbohydrates in allergy formulas are usually a less common grain, such as rice or barley, but such ingredients as potato and quinoa are sometimes used. Allergies are more likely to develop with consistent exposure to certain proteins. The problems that arise from these types of foods, especially lamb based, is that they have grown so popular that people don’t realize that they are for allergy prone animals. Not that there is anything wrong with feeding dogs without allergies, but the general idea is to feed your dog the basic chicken formula and then switch them to an allergy formula should allergies arise from the chicken. This way you can try to point out the ingredient that they are most likely allergic too. For example, I have a miniature wiener dog that is allergic to chicken, so we switched him to a herring meal. Not only is the allergic reaction gone, but the added beneficial oils from the fish alleviates his dandruff issues and the rice in the formula is great for his sensitive stomach. 
Conclusion It truly is impossible to imagine a world where dogs never existed. Owning a dog is just such a privilege that a majority of families own a dog, or have owned a dog at some point of time in their lives. The level of intelligence is simply leaps and bounds beyond any other pet you could ever think of. They are always loyal, protective, and caring to their owners. There is simply an unbreakable bond between a dog and its owner, which is like having a brother or sister, a daughter or son, or just the best friend of your life. Its simply astounding that there is such a strong connection between dogs and humans, yet their lives are so short in comparison and range between 10-15 years in length. Of course there are always exceptions to this time span, but the truth is that they never live with you forever and you have to cherish the time you have with them. There are now companies that have latched on to this emotional connection to dogs and can clone your pet so you can literally spend another dog lifespan with your favorite companion. Perhaps they are not the most unique animal in the world, but when it comes to the hobby of raising a dog from being a puppy to old age, there is no hobby more passionate that having a pet dog.",
Water Ski,"Water Ski Information  Introduction The basic idea of water skiing is simple; it involves a skier being pulled across the surface of the water on skis. To accomplish this you’ll need to understand the physics and safety measures to be successful. 

Despite the fact there is some minor disagreement of when water skiing was started; the sport is recognized all across the world. This hobby may be a more suitable option for those who live near a water way that allows skiing. Additionally, some of the cost involved in beginning the sport may give certain individuals a bit of hesitation for starting. 

It should be noted that instructors who teach the sport often have most if not all the equipment you need. This makes practicing and getting involved in the hobby a much easier process. 

Of couse the is one other style of water skiing that doesn’t involve skis. This form is called barefooting or barefoot water skiing. The principles of this form remain similar to traditional water skiing. A second section will follow after the conclusion to cover this area of the sport. 
Types
Trick skiing Waterski pyramidTrick skiing is a type of water skiing where skiers try to perform tricks somewhat similar to those of gymnasts while being pulled along by the boat.  
Slalom skiing In the context of water skiing, slalom means to use only one ski. A special slalom ski is used which has two plates, a front boot and either a toe plate, open binding, or another binding (similar to the front binding) behind the main one. The bindings are oriented so that both feet point forward, with one behind the other. Slalom skiing dramatically increases the speed and agility of the water skier.  
Tournament slalom skiing In tournament slalom skiing, a course is set up with buoys and water skiers are expected to navigate through and around the obstacles using only one ski. Sanctioned competitions require official drivers and approved boats. A skier`s score is based upon the number of successful buoys cleared and the length of the rope.  
Ski jump The ski jump is performed on two long skis and skiers are towed behind a boat at fixed speed, using a ramp. Professional ski jumpers can travel up to 250 feet (76 m) and hit the ramp at speeds up to 70 mph.  
Ski racing Water ski racing consists of a number of water skiers who race around a set course. 

A team consists of a boat driver, an observer and one to two skiers. The driver will tow the skier behind a powerboat, varying the speed as different conditions are encountered, according to the driver`s knowledge of the skier, the observer`s ability to read the skier and the signals which the skier gives to the driver. 
Safety Unlike some hobbies, the environment in which you practice can be a danger. This is why a number of safety measures are suggested to all those who ski. There are no exceptions to this advice. 

First, make sure that you wear a coast guard approved floatation device. Many life jackets feature adjustable straps. However, this life saving equipment has specific sizes. Make sure the life jacket you wear is made for you and your body type. If you aren’t sure how to make sure, the sales representative where life jackets are purchased can help you. 

Second, make sure the captain of the boat is experienced. Nothing will jeopardize your safety more than someone who doesn’t know what they are doing. This is especially true when they are dragging a person behind their vehicle. 

Third, make sure you ski in a safe area of the water. This means that you should ski near docks or other boats. You should also make sure the water way isn’t shallow or filled with a lot of other obstacles like floating logs. 

Fourth, make sure the only part of your body that is connected to the handle is your hands. Never wrap the rope around any part of your equipment or body. 

Fifth, make sure the spotter and you know all the most appropriate hand signals. 

Sixth, if you feel like you’re going to fall you can do so in one of two ways. Either you can fall backwards or to the side. Don’t fall forward. Your life jacket can work more effectively if you fall back or to the side because of their design. If you fall forward you could potentially inhale, swallow, and/or impair yourself with the water in your face.  
Hand signals There are five basic hand signals that should be agreed upon before beginning any type of water skiing. These signals should be conveyed with the hands since vocal signals can either get drown out by the motor or misunderstood. 

The easiest signals to point out are the start and stop commands. You can’t ski if no one goes anywhere. Because the position water skiers have to hold, fatigue will demand that you eventually stop. 

The next basic commands to work out are speed up and slow down. The boat doesn’t need to feel comfortable on the water but you do. Once you’re out on the water it may take a bit of time to adjust yourself where you feel most comfortable. By having these hand signals, you can make this process for everyone involved. 

The last basic command is danger. Any number of things can go wrong when you are out on the water. If you feel something wrong you must tell someone as soon as possible. 

More advanced and specific signals can be worked out depending on your level of proficiency. These additional signals can help in more advanced maneuvers like jumping and sharp turns. 
The Basics Once all safety issues have been addressed, you can begin learning the basics of water skiing. For starters, it’s good to know everyone involved. This includes you, the skier, a spotter and a driver. 

The average length of the tow rope should be 75 feet in length. Make sure that the rope, handle, ski bindings, and life jacket are in good working condition. 

Before entering the water you may want to practice on land to get your form right. This is primarily advice for beginners. 

Start by keeping a straight posture. This means your head is up, your back is straight, and arms are in front of you in a fairly straight but relaxed position. 

Your knees and ankles will be slightly bent. This will not only give you control on how you list from side to side, but also act as a shock absorber when dealing with things like a wake. 

Once you have your stance, hold the handle on the tow rope. Then have someone pull on the rope. This should get you used to the motion you’ll experience when you’re in the water. When you feel comfortable with this position you can move to the deep water start. 
Deep Water Start When you’re in the water, return to the position you were when on land. Your head should be up and knees should be bent. When you’re ready you can inform those on the boat to take out the slack. 

To take out the slack the boat will slowly move forward to make the rope taught. If they fail to do so, the result would be similar to a whip being cracked. Except in this case, you’re at the end of the whip. 

Once this is done, you can let those in the boat that you’re ready to start. At this point, the boat will pick up enough speed enabling you to stand on the water. 

When attempting to stand make sure you don’t draw your arms towards your body. This will only serve to unbalance you and make you fall. Also, make sure not to look at the water. This too will throw off your balance making you lean forward. 

Once up, your knees and ankles should remain slightly bent. Put most of your weight on the balls of your feet. This will allow you to control how you follow the boat and deal with the rough spots on the water. 

If you have trouble getting to the surface of the water, it may be due to the wrong type of skis. For water skiing you can go one of two ways when choosing skis. Wider skis have more surface area making it easier to get on top of the water. They make an excellent choice for beginners. The other style of skis is narrow. These are ideal for making turns quickly. They are more responsive so they make an excellent choice for the more advanced skier. 

It is also a good idea to test a wide variety of skis if you are able. Like any product, people will find they prefer one brand over another. It’s also important that there are types of skis for different styles of water skiing. The slalom ski is a single board with two bindings. A training set of skis might be tied. This prevents the skier from doing the splits and helps the novice skier to advance to the standing stage more easily. As always ask the store representative if you can’t figure out which skis you need. 
Riding the Wake For many sports, tricks are taught only to advanced members. In water skiing one trick is more essential and is often taught to novice skiers. This involves crossing the boat’s wake. 

The wake of a boat is where there is a visible disturbance in the water from where the boat passed. Since there is a disturbance here crossing over it can be a bit challenging. 

The reason why this trick is so important is because you need to turn the boat at some point. In these turns it’s virtually impossible to avoid crossing the boat’s wake. In fact, it is easier to stay upright if you do cross the boat’s wake when turning. 

The act of turning will change the force at which the boat pulls the rope. This change is impossible to avoid especially in smaller water ways like a lake or river. 

14 to 20 miles per hour speed is needed to maintain you on the water’s surface. In a turn the inside curve will drop the force at which the boat pulls you significantly. Therefore, they suggest you ride the outside wake which only loses a fraction of the pulling force. 

To ride a wake is relatively simple. Since your knees act as shock absorbers, you will be doing most of the work there. A wake is nothing more than a rough patch of water and should be treated as such. By compensating for the turbulence you’ll be able to ride the wake. This technique may take a little practice, but it is the most basic and most fundamental trick you’ll need to know. Otherwise, you’ll have to fall into the water every time the boat needs to turn around. 
What You Need Water skiing requires a skier, a spotter and a boat driver. The boat needs to provide enough speed to allow you to get up on the water. Also, make sure your water way allows water skiing. If it doesn’t then it is probably not safe. 

A 75 foot tow rope and handle are needed. Water skis for the skier are a must and everyone should have Coast Guard approved life jackets. 

Wet suits are only required if the area in which you are skiing is cold. Water skiing gloves may also be required in similar conditions. For beginners a wet suit or swim suit may be the only required equipment asked for by instructors. 

The ability to swim is highly recommended but not entirely necessary. Most of your contact with the water will be handled by either your life jacket or the skis. 

Additional equipment like goggles can be decided on a person to person basis. If you have other gear you feel you need, it’s best to consult the boat driver who should be one of the most experienced people there. 
Waterskiing Conclusion Water skiing is a fun activity for those of all ages. Both young and old can find the challenge of the sport as an enjoyable hobby. However, there are a few exceptions and things you need to look out for when attempting this sport. 

The strength of your body can play a crucial role in the sport. Mostly it will determine your stamina and how long you can do the sport. Your balance is another important area that you can’t ignore. If you have problems standing on land, water skiing might not be the best choice for you. 

Aside from these minor things to be aware of, water skiing is open to all people. Even those with disabilities can find ways to effectively accomplish the sport. It also should be noted that this sport can be advanced in either an entertaining manner or competitive level. 

Unlike many sports there is no compulsion to advance in the sport. Thousands of people are happy to learn the most basic skills of water skiing and nothing more.

Barefooting Barefoot skiing is water skiing behind a motorboat without the use of water skis, commonly referred to as ""barefooting"". Barefooting requires the skier to travel at higher speeds than conventional water skiing (30-45mph). 

For many barefoot water skiing is the next evolution for the professional water skier. Your feet operate as a much smaller ski which is preferred by experts. In addition, the padded wet suit is a must for this sport which means it may not be any cheaper because it doesn’t need skis. 

Being a relatively newer form of water skiing there are a lot more possibilities for growth. As seen in the history, much of this form of the sport has been discovered by accident. It may still be a sport enjoyed by people of all ages, but it is still one for the pros.",
Musicals,"Musicals Information  Introduction Musicals have always been a very important part of human culture and though they are no longer the main focus for entertainment, they are still a beautiful and important part of life today.

For those who want to learn to appreciate musicals or to become a part of musicals themselves, knowing the history and some of the most popular musicals, is a step in the right direction. 
History Musical theater has existed since the time of the ancient Greeks. They would often include music and dance numbers in their theatrical performances. The ancient Romans even created tap shoes in order for the sounds of the dancer’s steps to be audible in large outdoor theaters. Even in ancient India it was common for music to be included in plays and performances. 

Throughout the Renaissance it became common for long plays to be broken up by a short musical play. It was during this time that a number of different opera types became popular and these forms of entertainment would eventually evolve into the type of musical that is popular today. It was in 1752 that theatrical performances first came to the United States when a London entrepreneur sent an acting troupe managed by his brother to the U.S. 

It was not long before other forms of entertainment started to become popular in the United States, particularly in New York. In the 1800s theater began to progress to downtown New York with performances like those of P.T. Barnum. Then musicals began to hit the Broadway stage with The Elves in 1857 being the first “long-run” musical. But even at this time London was still leading the way in musical theater. 

In the 1920’s musicals began to change as movies began to take the stage. Things changed even more in the 1930’s when the depression and talking pictures took to the stage. With the depression funds were very limited so people could not spend as much on musicals as they once could. Therefore going to see musicals at the movies became much more affordable. But for those that could afford to see musical theater the entertainment was some of the best ever offered. 

Once the economy rebounded, the musicals took center stage once more. By the 1950’s and 1960’s musicals began to transform as not only Broadway gained attention but off-Broadway as well. Some musicals even began to incorporate rock music and controversial themes, which made them the talk of the town. The 1980’s saw the introduction of Pop Operas in which musicals would feature pop music or even music that was popular at the time. In recent years musical theater has taken to adapting movies to the musical stage and theatrical musicals are making their way to the big screen. 
Watching Musicals Appreciating musicals is often something that takes time. Beginners should make it a point to learn the musical’s story before going to see the performance live. The reason for this is that many musicals might seem disjointed or confusing if someone does not know the story beforehand.

On the other hand it is a great learning a experience and a great way to break into even bigger productions. There are also plenty of theaters that run on the help and volunteer efforts of individuals, this can also a be a great place to start to get experience and make some connections. 

Local colleges or community centers may also offer classes in acting and theater production that might be a great place to get started and to really learn the tricks of the trade.

Sake Tasting,"Sake Tasting Information  Introduction Sake is usually called as rice wine, but unlike wine, the alcohol in the sake is not fermented from sugar. Instead, the sake is actually made in a process where brewing of the sake is done. This is more like beer in the process in which it is manufactured. When the brewing is done, it is very dissimilar to wine since wine is made by fermentation. So actually calling sake as rice wine is a misnomer. 

Another important factor about Sake is that it contains more alcoholic content than either wine or even beer. It is well known than the alcoholic content in wine is usually about 10 to 15 percent. Beer usually has about 5 to 10 percent of alcohol. Sake on the other hand, has a lot of alcohol in it which is more than 15 percent and near to 20 percent. This concentration is reduced by adding water. Once the sake is diluted, then it is bottled. 

Sake is one of the drinks that originated from Japan. Japan is a place where different kinds of drinks were made. These alcoholic drinks were made from various kinds of materials like rice and other stuff. As time went by, people started using the sake for social occasions. This rapidly increased the popularity of Sake in Japan. Though Sake was very popular, there was a period during the wars, when the sake production and consumption decreased. 

These days, Sake is not only popular in Japan, but it has become popular in all places over the world. This has made the number of places making the drink to crop up in even far off places. In fact there are many places in China and other parts of Asia where Sake is being made. Other than these areas, Sake is also being made in both north and South America and parts of Europe. 

Sadly, in the land of the sake, where the brew initially originated, people have started consuming other drinks like beer and wine that the number of places where Sake is being made is on the decline in Japan. 

The popularity of the sake means that there are millions of people who are fond of the drink. As sake is brewed, it needs to be tasted to know the quality of the sake. So who is needed to test the sake, but Sake tasters. Sake tasting is an important method of checking to find out which is the best sake. 

Sake is mainly imported by some countries who do not have their own places for making the sake. In this situation, it is very important for the sake tasters to identify the right kind of sake to be imported. In fact the Sake that is made in each company may vary. To overcome this, the sake tasters are used to taste the different varieties and decide on the quality and other factors of the sake. This makes the role of sake tasters to be very important as far as the sake industry is concerned. 

Since sake tasting involves a relaxed time with friends where one can drink a beverage that is alcoholic, sake tasting has become one of the well known pastimes and hobbies of recent times. 
History of Sake The sake and the preparation process have undergone a sea change over the years. Now sake is being made all over the world. As this has become the norm, the taste of sake has also changed. The quality of sake, the taste and other factors change from one place to another.

This 3rd century Chinese text speaks of the Japanese drinking and dancing. Sake is also mentioned several times in the Kojiki, Japan`s first written history, compiled in 712. People used sake for spiritual functions because people who had it got a fever. 
Qualities of a good sake tester Many people who are ignorant of sake tasting may think if sake tasting is really needed and if it is important. The truth is that sake tasting is a very integral part of the sake industry. The best sake will get a better price when compared to the one that is not good. Not only are clients using sake tasters to check the quality of the sake that is being produced, but the sake makers are also in perennial need of sake tasters because these are the people who are able to make or break the company with their reviews and ideas about the sake that is produced. 

There are various factors that have to be on the mind of every sake taster. The sake taster itself should be a person who should have certain qualities that sets the person apart from the rest of the people. The sake taster should first be able to identify the taste of the sake. Taste does not mean than tasting is just to check if the sake is good or bad. It is a lot more than that. The sake taster should be able to compare it to the previously made sakes. The sake taster should also be able to identify what is wrong or right about a particular sake. This will help the process of sake making to be fine tuned. 

The sake taster has to identify if the sake is harsh to the tongue when drinking. There are different levels of qualities that are made from the same brewer. This makes the number of sake kinds to run into hundreds of varieties and they may change from time to time depending on various factors. So the role of a sake taster is also never ending and important. 

The different varieties of sake that include junmai, ginjo and daiginjo may vary drastically. Some are expensive and others are cheaper, but the variations do not end there. They also vary in the quality and taste. 
The types of sake that needs to be tasted and differentiated There are different kinds of sake that are available and the sake taster should be ready to taste all these kinds and differentiate the taste.

In fact, the sake taster needs to be alert to identify any change in the taste or other parameters in the sake. 

The different kinds of sake that the sake taster needs to know about are listed here. 

There are two basic types of sake: futsū-shu and tokutei meishō-shu. Futsū-shu, ""ordinary sake,"" is the equivalent of table wine and accounts for the majority of sake produced. Tokutei meishō-shu, ""special designation sake,"" refers to premium sakes distinguished by the degree to which the rice is polished and the added percentage of brewer`s alcohol or the absence of such additives. 
The parameters involved in sake tasting Sake tasting may seem all fun and joy, but there is some hard work that needs to be done by every sake taster. There are various parameters that make the sake to be the best or the worst. These parameters have to be kept in mind by every sake taster so that the process of sake tasting is more involved and effective. When these parameters are taken into consideration, then the sake taster will be able to make sure that the sake tasting results are standardized.  
The fragrance The fragrance itself plays a major role in the quality of sake tasting. There are many people who are excellent sake tasters and they will be able to tell you the quality of the sake, just by smelling the sake. There are some sakes that have mild fragrance and others that are strong. In fact the smell and the taste senses are connected and the sake taster will be able to take in the taste of the sake with the smell. The fragrance depends on the items that are used to make the sake. The reason for the sake taster to be knowledgeable and be able to identify the smell of the sake is because there are some people who will like some kind of smell to the sake and this can also be added to the sake. Other people like the rice based sake that has no strong taste or smell and instead is very light and good to taste.  
Sweetness Similar to the other parameters, the amount of sweetness in the sake is another important factor that needs to be identified and listed by the sake taster. There are different grades that are given by the sake tester to quantitatively measure the sweetness of the sake. A very sweet sake may not be very good just like the one that has no taste at all. The sake should be a perfect blend to make it taste well. The density and the specific gravity of the sake are also important aspects of sake that one has to remember. A good sake taster will be able to give reliable readings each and every time he tastes sake. The fact that the sweetness of the sake is highly dependent on the factors like temperature of the surroundings makes it  
Acidity: The acidity is measured while the sake is made. In spite of this, it is also the job of the sake taster to test the acidity and how it tastes. There are some sake that are not at all acidic. Though the sake may not be acidic in the tests, the taste can be acidic. This is the reason why a sake taster is very important. The sweet content and also other factors play a major role in the acidity of the sake.  
The fullness of sake: Sake can feel light or full. It depends on various factors that had an impact on the sake when it was being made. There are sometimes when the sake can feel full when you consume it. The difference has to be identified by the sake taster. There are various factors that can play a role in this. This makes it impossible to identify the taste properly and only an experienced person well versed in sake testing will be able to identify it. 
Tasting the sake The process of tasting the sake is the most important one and the sake taster should take care that he is ready to do the job before starting to taste the sake. The sake should be served and tasted in specific methods that will help the process to be better. There are some important traditions that are attached to the method in which the sake is served and tasted. The methods of sake tasting are listed here. 

Sake is served chilled, at room temperature, or heated, depending on the preference of the drinker, the quality of the sake, and the season. Typically, hot sake is a winter drink, and high-grade sake is not drunk hot, because the flavors and aromas will be lost. This masking of flavor is the reason that low-quality sake is often served hot. 

Sake is usually drunk from small cups called choko and poured into the choko from ceramic flasks called tokkuri. Saucer-like cups called sakazuki are also used, most commonly at weddings and other ceremonial occasions. Recently, footed glasses made specifically for premium sake have also come into use. 

Another traditional cup is the masu, a box usually made of hinoki or sugi, which was originally used for measuring rice. In some Japanese restaurants, as a show of generosity, the server may put a glass inside the masu or put the masu on a saucer and pour until sake overflows and fills both containers. 

Aside from being served straight, sake can be used as a mixer for cocktails, such as tamagozake, saketinis, nogasake, or the sake bomb. 
Impact of the sake The impact of the sake is another important factor that needs to be identified by the sake taster. There are various factors that can change the impact. The sake taster should know these facts and be able to differentiate the various kinds. Even the alkalinity or acidity of the water from which the sake was made can change the taste and the impact of the sake. The sake that is made in some breweries are very mild and have a soft impact on the person drinking it. This should be packaged separately from the sake that has a great impact on the senses. The one that has a hard impact on the individual has to be packed as a stronger sake as it can bowl a person over! An experienced sake taster will describe each of the sakes differently. The mild one is described as quiet and the one that is strong is considered to be explosive in taste.

Sake tasters are paid will by the people who make the sake as the sake tasters are the ones who help them to learn about the quality of the sake. These sake tasters also identify as to what is missing in the sake. The sake tasters are on firm ground as far as their hobby or work is concerned. Though sake is declining in Japan, it is being used in larger quantities in all other countries. In fact different varieties of sake are being created in other countries and the sake taster will be in high demand in all these places. So every sake taster will not only have fun, but will be able to make money having all the fun. It should also be remembered that the sake tester also needs to be very alert and consistently give good results.",
Model Ship Boat Kits,"Model Ship Boat Kits Information  Introduction For centuries people have been building model ships. It’s only been in more recent times that kits for these models have become more standard. Unlike other models, ships tend to be designed with functionality as well as detail. 

The following sections will introduce all the history and types of models in the world. Then we’ll look at the tools needed to handle a ship model found in a kit from your local hobby store. 
Tools for model kits If you find that you are serious about pursuing modeling, you’re going to need a number of tools to help in the process. These tools are broken up into two major groups. The first is the essential tools of the trade. These tools enable you to get the proper amount of detailing found in professionally built models. 

The second group of tools is more for luxury. These tools make the process easier and the outcome better. These tools are also more expensive so only get them if you find your hobby has turned into a passion. It’s recommended that you start with the basic tools before working your way up to the luxury tools.  
Essential Assembling a model by hand is only for the youngest and most basic model builder. These sets most likely have a snap together design with no tools required. Those types of models need little to know guidance and their outcome will show a very basic model. 

When you’re ready for the ones you want to display, you’ll need a few tools to help accomplish this. The following paragraphs will introduce the tool and describe some of the functionality of the tool. 

The first tool is a hobby knife. The knife comes in two parts the blade and the handle. The normal blade type used in model building is a number 11. The average brand for this knife is Exacto knife. The hobby knife is a great tool for removing plastic pieces from the sprues (the plastic frame that holds the pieces. It also is useful in removing the flash (extra plastic that is still attached to your piece) from the pieces. You can also use the knife in a dozen other situations that you might come across in the process of building the model. 

Safety glasses are an important part of model building. When you`re cutting pieces tiny shards and debris are likely to fly about causing minor annoyance and/or injury. Since a good degree of eye sight helps in the model building process, it’s wise not to chance blinding yourself. The safety glasses also play a substantial role in protecting your eyes from harsh glues paints and other materials you might need throughout the build. 

Sand paper can prove to be invaluable when trying to achieve a high degree of detail. It can be used to sand away excess glue or create a much smoother surface when painting. It’s recommended to get a variety of grits for these purposes. 400 to 1000 are perfectly suitable ranges when selecting the fineness of the grit. Some modelers go as fine as 2000 for their models. 

Fine tweezers make an excellent tool in model building. During any detailed model build, you’ll find occasions to handle extremely tiny pieces. These pieces require a fine tool to allow you to grip and place the piece while still being able to see the piece. The fine tweezers are custom designed exactly for this task. 

Paint brushes are a modeler’s best friend. Even when you use airbrushing techniques, you’ll still find that small out of the way parts will need a touch of paint. You can also use these delicate brushes to maintain your models. Perhaps they need a delicate dusting or a small piece needs a touch up to its paint job. Check with your local hobby store to determine if they recommend certain sizes for various jobs. 

Pins prove to be ideal for applying a very fine bead of glue. They not only have the ability for amazing precision, but they also give the modeler great visibility on where the glue will be applied. Since the pins are made of metal, they will resist bending or warping like other options you might think of to accomplish this task. 

Toothpicks may not be ideal for applying glue like pins, but they do have their uses. Mostly they’re best for stirring your small containers of paint. They also are a good for testing the color and consistency of your paint. It also helps that they’re really cheap. 

Glue, without it your models won’t stay together. Check your kit for suggestions on which glues will work best. If no suggestions are given, Testers Glue in the tube will serve for most things. You can also get the advice from the clerk at the hobby store. 

Filler, this usually comes in a tube. The large scale equivalent would probably be cocking. Its use here is to smooth out areas between glued parts. Once applied and set, you can use sand paper to smooth the area and get it prepped for painting. 

If you aren’t sure if a part fits together, tape makes an excellent tool for helping to figure this out. Tape also makes it easy to cover areas you don’t want painted. Use it similarly to how you’d paint around a window. 

Disposable gloves make a nice addition to your modeling tools. Some glue will recommend keeping away from contacting your skin. This will aid in making this possible. Also, gloves will help prevent finger prints when you get to the painting stage of your modeling project. 

Finally, paints and thinners are the final essential tools. This will be where the primary amount of customization of your model comes in. It’s recommended that you select the thinner that the paint used recommends. This will insure the most optimum effectiveness and reduce damage to your model.  
Luxury As you build more and more models, you might find that certain areas of the process must have an easier method. A lot of times they do. However, it’s really only justifiable if you use the tool more than a hand full of times. 

The following tools outlined here are designed to not only make your life easier, but give a more polished model. They may take some time to figure them out. Once you do, it will make a world of difference. 

The first two tools are the cutting pliers and razor saw. Both are designed for very precise cutting of small object. This makes pieces held by the toughest sprues a breeze. They can also come in handy if you need to convert a model and need a piece cut. 

For those who want a more specific tool, you do have the option of a sprue cutter. This tool is specifically designed for modelers to remove parts. The only draw back is that it has a little less functionality that the cutting pliers and razor saw. 

To get more visibility when assembling or painting your model, you can always invest in a desk lamp that has a magnifier. The magnification is not terribly powerful, but it does give you an edge in dealing with very small detail work. 

If you find you get tired of gluing and filling, you can move to a more advanced glue. It’s called Cyano-acrylate glue. Many refer to it as C.A. glue. This will not only glue pieces, but it makes excellent filler all in one. It is a very strong product, so it’s recommended to wear safety glasses with it. 

When attempting to get a better paint job on a model, it’s recommended to use either a spray can or airbrush. For an airbrush you’ll also need a small air compressor. Due to the application process, you will eliminate streaks left behind by brushes. 

Other accessories that can aid in the painting process help the modeler more than the model. Three such pieces of equipment are the paint booth, turntable and hot-glue gun. The paint booth will help ventilate and catch loose paint that shoots from the spray variety paint applicators. It is perfect for those who don’t have the option of building your model outside. 

The turntable allows the modeler from touching painted areas. The turning action also means they don’t have to get up from where they are sitting. 

The hot-glue gun is used slightly differently. By utilizing the glue on a scrap piece of material, you can use it to position small plastic pieces when painting them. Fortunately, this is probably something you already have and won’t be an additional cost. 

Finally, for the most advanced modelers, there’s the dremel motor tool. This is both a cutting and grinding device that makes alterations of plastic pieces possible. It’s recommended that when you begin using this tool, start out with more basic models that are less expensive. This will give you plenty of practice so that when it does matter you’ll have the experience needed for the job. 
Preparations for model kits Before starting you will want to prepare a few things first. The most important point is deciding where you’re going to build the model. A flat sturdy surface is essential for this task. Many people will choose the dining room table for this very reason. However, the model may take more than one sitting to complete. 

This is why you should look for certain things when selecting a work space. First, is the surface flat and sturdy? Second, is there adequate lighting? Third, is there proper ventilation of the area? Fourth, is it okay if things spill in this area? With these questions answered you can determine the perfect spot for model building. 

Now that you have a work space all picked out, you need to prepare the parts. This includes washing the pieces before assembly. In the model making process, the pieces of your model have to be pulled out of a mold. To do this a mold removal agent is applied to the parts. This agent will prevent other materials from adhering to the surface of the pieces, this includes paint you might try using. 

This is why you should wash your pieces first. Take a pan of soapy water and lightly scrub the parts in the sprues with your finger. You can let the parts air dry on a paper towel or other soft clean surface. If beads of water settle on the parts you should use a blow drier to prevent them from spotting the pieces. 

You can repeat this process before painting your model. The oils in your fingers can have a distorting effect on your paint job. They may leave finger prints and or cause an uneven coat of paint. 

Fix parts that are defective in some way. This includes removing flash from the pieces. You can cut this off with a hobby knife. Fill in sink spots if necessary. Sink spots are typically caused by necessary techniques in the molding process. They show up as depressions in the plastic. Most of the time, these spots are put in out of the way places and don’t need filling. However, if the piece is highly visible you may need to use filler. 

Another fix that some parts need are cosmetic than anything else. For example a part may contain a copyright stamp by the manufacturer. This will be very noticeable if you’re going for an extremely detailed look. You can remove this writing with some rubbing with sand paper. 

Read and make notes on your instructions. Many times the instructions will give you a good idea where the tough spots are in your model. You can make note of them and prepare yourself mentally to handle them. It also is good to make notes if you plan to alter the model’s design in certain areas. The instructions also are likely to provide a list of paints to use for an accurate portrayal of the model. With a list of paints in hand, you can have what you need when you need it. 

As stated before, a model may take more than one sitting. This means you might want to prepare an area for storing pieces. For decals and small pieces that have been painted, you should use zip-loc bags or similar type container for storage. For pieces still in the sprues you can fit these back in the box. Make sure to separate these pieces with paper towels to prevent scratching of the pieces. 

Now that you have all your tools and the prep work out of the way, you can begin building your favorite models. 
Conclusion If you hear the sea calling but you can’t answer, you can at least enjoy the ships of the sea. The models you can find at your local hobby store will give you the option not only to enjoy these ships, but to choose a point of history that you find most interesting. 

This hobby is great for individuals or the whole family. Of course, the family might need to coordinate their actions to enjoy the activity. The open waters are waiting. So cast your anchor and shove off.",
Animation,"Animation InformationINTRODUCTIONAnimation is basically taking a static image, photo or drawing and making it move. It is the art of creating the illusion of movement, i.e. making that static image run, walk, jump, talk, etc.As a child, I used to draw a series of images, or stick men, on the right hand corners of a book – a flick book - each one being slightly different to the one before. When completed and you flicked through the book quickly, it created the illusion that the stick man was running. Animation is principally the same thing.Animation is the rapid display of a sequence of images in order to create an illusion of movement. It is an optical illusion of motion and has over the years developed tremendously. The effects that animators can now achieve with the use of computers is quite astounding and very skilful. Animation can be seen in a wide rangeANIMATION TECHNIQUESThe principal animation techniques are:Traditional animation, also known as Cel or hand-drawn animation.Full animation, including Limited animation, Rotoscoping and Live Action animation.Stop Motion, including Puppet, Clay, Cutout, Silhouette, Model, Graphic and Object animation, Puppetoon, Go Motion and Pixilation.2D animation, including Analog, Flash and Powerpoint.3D animation, including Photo Realisticm and Cel-Shaded animation, and Motion Capture.Drawn on Film, Paint on Glass, Sand and Pinscreen animation, and Flip Book.Character and Special Effects animation.Multi-sketching.Animatronics.Traditional AnimationTraditional animation or cel animation or hand-drawn animation is the process of piecing together individual frames which are drawn on paper. Each drawing is slightly different than the previous one (made by way of tracing part of the drawing). This form of animation is not only the oldest, but also the most popular, although a large propotion of the ‘hand drawing’ aspects are now completed on a computer. Productions using traditional animation techniques usually follow a process:1. Storyboard – a sort of script including images, given to the animators who plan and compose the plot and imagery. A storyboard may be re-done several times before it is finally approved.2. Voice Recording – an initial soundtrack, or ‘scratch track’ is recorded and the animators synchronise their work to the soundtrack. The soundtrack includes the basic sound effects, dialogue, vocal songs and preliminary musical score. The final touches are usually added in post-production.3. Animatic – or story reel which is made after the soundtrack has been done, but before the animation starts. It consists of pictures from the synchronised storyboard, which can be amended, and allows for timings to be worked out. Editing at this stage prevents the possibility of animating parts of the film that would later be cut out of the film. Advertising agencies use Animatic to test their commercials prior to full production. Video storyboards have moving pieces, and Photomatics are another option but cost more.4. Design and Timing – designers prepare ‘model sheets’ that show how characters and props will look from different angles, from the animatic and storyboard. The background stylists work on the settings and locations, art directors and colour stylists work on the colour schemes. The timing director works with the animatic to work out poses, drawings, lip movements, etc will be needed and creates an ‘exposure sheet’, which is a table that breaks down all the elements frame-by-frame. If there is a lot of music, the timing director may also create a bar sheet.5. Layout – once the designs have been completed and approved, camera angles and paths, lighting and shading, and background layouts are drawn for each character. These, along with the storyboard and audio, are spliced together to create the final animatic.6. Animation – once the animatic has been approved, the animation starts.The lead animator draws the key parts of a scene, a frame at a time, using the character layouts, and these drawings have to be synchronised with the soundtrack to avoid any difference between sound and visual. The lead animator will also produce a ‘pencil test’ of the scene, i.e a preliminary version of the final scene, which are then linked with the soundtrack to make sure it all works together. It is then passed to the assistant animators who add all the details and any minor missing frames. Most of the time, animators will have to re-do scenes several times before the director is happy with them.Once the animation has been approved by the director, it moves over to the ‘clean-up’ department who take the drawings, trace them (including all the details of all the animators), add any missing details or frames (known as ‘tweening’), and then these are pencil-tested and ‘sweatboxed’ (or reviewed) until approved. At each stage of pencil animation, when it has been approved, it is spliced into a Leica reel.Pencil tests and layouts are predominantly done using video cameras and computers nowadays. There are four main elements: Digital Pencil Test, Digital Layout, Digital Storyboard and Backgrounds. Because of the widespread use of computers, the traditional forms of animation are being used less and less, and although you need skill to create computer generated images, the art of traditional animation is dying.However, because of computers and animation software, the scope of animation has become much more widespread. It has reduced the time it takes to produce an animated film, programme or cartoon and has greatly enhanced the special effects that films can now create.Full AnimationFull animation is the process of producing high-quality traditionally animated films, which regularly use detailed drawings and realistic movement.Disney hired animator-director, Mike Jittlov, to experiment with stop motion using Mickey Mouse toys. To commemorate Mickey Mouse’s 50th anniversary in1978, they produced a short sequence as part of a TV programme called Mouse Mania using stop motion. Mike Jittlov went on to produce some very good multi-technique stop motion work for Disney, and also produced a number of short animated films. A well-known British animation team – John Hardwick and Bob Bura – were the principal animators in many TV shows and the Trumptonshire trilogy.Eliot Noyes Jr., an independent clay animator in the 60s and 70s, was Oscar-nominated for his ‘free form’ clay animated film Clay or the Origin of Species, as well as for He Man and She Ra in 1972. He also used stop motion in his film Sandman to animate the laying of sand onto glass.Go motion is a type of model animation which uses techniques to create motion blur between frames of film, (not shown in traditional stop-motion). The technique was invented by Industrial Light & Magic for the movie The Empire Strikes Back (1980).A computer is programmed to move parts of a model during each frame and, combined with hand manipulation, produces a realistic motion effect. A manual version of Go motion was pioneered in the silent film era by Wladyslaw Starewicz, and was used in his film The Tale of the Fox.Since the introduction of computer generated imagery (CGI), stop motion has become almost obsolete, but not quite due to the fact that it is a less costly option, and that it has a ‘unique’ look on film. There are still some directors, such as Tim Burton, that believe that CGI cannot produce the real textures and feel created by stop motion techniques.Most recently, there has been a surge on the internet (YouTube, Google Video) of clay animation. Although simple in design, i.e. ‘free form’, they are very effective and portrayed predominantly in either as a comical character or in crime/violence scenes. But clay animation and stop motion has also been used in online music videos, such as Oren Lavie’s Her Morning Elegance.Stop MotionStop motion has been used in computer games, creating characters and animals using clay and latex rubber over wire frames. These were then shot one frame at a time and incorporated into the game via digital photography.Stop motion is also used in astronomy to observe diurnal motion. For example, the photographing of the solar analemma takes over a year, and the camera needs to remain motionless for that time but take pictures at the same time every few days.3D AnimationSince computer generated imagery was developed in the 1990s, making animation more realistic, controlled and faster, it has also brought about an added dimension, that of 3D, or 3-dimensional, and not just in the film industry. 3D animation is also extensively used in the gaming industry, such as video games, computer games and hand control games, as well as for simulators, particularly flight simulators, so that in training what the pilot sees outside the cockpit is as realistic as it can possibly be.3D combines models and programmed, or ‘key-framed’ movements. The models are made geometrical lines, edges and faces – similar to that of clay modelling – using the computer softwares extensive range of sculpting tools. The model, or virtual marionette, is allocated handles or and controllers which are then manipulated to create the illusion of movement, i.e. walking. This process is known as ‘rigging’ and some 3D models can contain thousands of different control points, i.e. Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia had approximately 1,851 controllers.Drawn On FilmOver the years, so many different variations of animation techniques have been pioneered by independent animators, film studios and artists. The technique of Drawn-On-Film animation is creating the images directly onto film stock, while Paint-On-Glass animation is manipulates slow drying oil paints on sheets of glass. Using traditional 2D, Erasure animation is where an image is photographed over a period of time as the artists manipulates the image.Pinscreen animation is a screen of movable pins, either in or out, by pressing an object onto the screen. The pins cast shadows as the screen is lit from either left or right, and creates the sort of textural effects that you wouldn’t be able to achieve with cel animation. Sand animation is where you have a backlit or front lit piece of glass for each frame, on which sand is moved around, to create a contrast of light effect.The technique was originally developed by Alexandre Alexeieff and his wife, Claire Parker. Their first pinscreen had 240,000 pins which were pressed one at a time, thereby creating a frame at a time, each one slightly different to the one before. As each frame was created, it was photographed and the photos were then put together to create an image without any gaps. This technique is time consuming, expensive and can be difficult to do, hence its unpopularity.However, in more recent times, computer programs have been developed so that you can create the frames digitally. The images can also be stored, retrieved and altered without having to re-create that particular frame.As well as animating objects, characters and backgrounds, there are other elements to creating an effect on film or in theatre, i.e. changing the visual appearance. These are known as Special Effects. Before the wide use of computers, special effects were produced by hand using a range of techniques. Animators used drybrush, airbrush, charcoal, grease pencil and backlit animation, but these special effects could also be produced during filming by the camerman using different exposures, filters, gels and diffusers. The use of computers today gives animators and directors far more scope in the quality and type of special effects that can be created, as well as accelerating the gaming industry.AnimatronicsAnimatronics is the use of electronics and robotics in mechanized puppets to simulate life.12 PRINCIPLES OF ANIMATIONDuring the 1930s, animators at Walt Disney Studios (including Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas) developed a set of principles for producing animated objects, characters, backgrounds, etc. Based on their experiences and accumulated knowledge, these became known as the 12 Principles of Animation which have since been adopted and used as a general guideline since then. Despite the rise of computer generated imagery, the principles laid down in respect of traditional animation are still relevant today.The 12 principles are:1. Squash and stretch.2. Anticipation.3. Staging.4. Straight ahead and pose-to-pose animation.5. Follow through and overlapping action.6. Slow-out and slow-in.7. Arcs.8. Secondary action.9. Timing.10. Exaggeration.11. Solid drawing.12. Appeal.Squash and StretchSquash and Stretch is probably the most important principle and is to give the character an illusion of weight and volume as it moves. It is also used to create facial expressions as well as animating dialogue. Depending on how extreme the effect you want to create, using squash and stretch the character can take on an almost comical appearance. This technique is used in all types of character animation, from a person walking or running, to a ball bouncing or being thrown.AnticipationAnticipation is a technique used to create the scene for the audience, capture their attention, before a character performs an action, i.e. before it jumps or runs or an expression changes. Usually a backward motion happens, and then the action occurs. This is probably more effective to see in comical characters.StagingSo that the audience can clearly see the pose, action or communication of a character on screen, i.e. attitude, mood, emotion, the director will use long and close-up shots or camera angles to show this and direct the audience to that particular action. This is known as Staging. However, the director must make sure that the background effects or animation do not overshadow the action of the character.Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose AnimationStraight Ahead animation is worked on from the start, from the first drawings and through to the final approved version, but using this technique can mean that you may lose the visual proportions, volume or size. Fast actions scenes are usually completed using straight ahead animation. Pose-to-Pose is much more planned and drawings are done at certain points during the scene. It is much easier to control proportions as well as the action. A lot of scenes will use both of these techniques, and are usually completed by the lead animator.Follow Through and Overlapping ActionWhen see on a computer screen or on drawings completed by hand, as the main part of a character stops, the other details of the character then catch up, such as the hair, clothing, tail or ears, and this is known as Follow Through. However, when the character goes in a different direction but his clothes or hair continue in the other direction, this is known as Overlapping Action. If you then decide that the clothes or hair will follow the character in the new direction a couple of frames later, this is known as ‘Drag’. To use these techniques, timing is everything.Slow Out and Slow InThe fewer the drawings, the faster the action; the greater the drawings, the slower the action. So you could have more drawings at the start and end of a pose, with only a couple in the middle, which softens the action and creating a more life-like image. This is known as Slow-In and Slow-Out. To show surprise or shock (a ‘gag’ action), some the slow-in or slow-out actions will be taken out.ArcsThe majority of actions follow a circular path, or an Arc, particularly human and animal figures. The Arc gives the action more fluency, flow and are more natural visually.Secondary ActionTo be able to add another dimension to characters or to back-up a main action, i.e. making a walk aggressive, or to add dialogue, or to swing the arms to and fro, is known as Secondary Action. These actions are supporting or emphasise the main action so must not distract the audience from the main action.TimingAs mentioned above, Timing is essential and is only truly learnt with experience and experiment. Varying the timing throughout the production adds texture and keeps the audience interested, but is also important in creating a character’s mood or reaction or emotion.ExaggerationTo avoid stiff or mechanical looking action, and particularly in making facial expressions appear as natural as possible, Exaggeration is used, but avoid too much as you don’t want the character to look cartoonish, except in cartoons! Exaggeration is an effect useful for animation, as perfect imitation of reality can look static and dull in cartoons.Solid DrawingSolid Drawing is utilising the basic principles of drawing weight, volume, solidity and the illusion of 3D. Drawing is classical, using pencil sketches, which are then transformed into colour and movement. Illusion is three- and four-dimensional – movement in space is three-dimensional, movement in time is four-dimensional.AppealAnimated characters need to be appealing, from cute and cuddly, cruel and villainous, to comical and heroic, something that will capture the audience’s attention and particularly with the lead character or characters. It is developing the character and the storyline together, creating continuity, reality, believable and likeable.ANIMATION SOFTWAREThere are a multitude of different software applications that can be used to create animated characters or objects, from most well-known (as well as lesser known) manufacturers and suppliers, and all can be purchased via any reputable computer supplier, via the internet and direct from software suppliers. It is not always easy to know which package to go for, particularly if you are new to the art of animation. Prices differ, as to the tools available, features, extras and how user-friendly the package is. Because of this, it is worth ‘trying before buying’. Search the internet for animation software packages that you can download and try for free. Some applications are entirely free, but they usually have less tools, extras, etc. Some are shareware, but again can have limited functions, and some offer a trial period, i.e. for 30 days, and then give you the option to buy at the end of the time period. A software application that is suitable for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux is Pencil. The package allows you to create traditionally hand-drawn images using bitmap and vector graphics, it is free and is open source – well worth looking at.Adobe have recently released their latest Flash, the CS5, while Poser Pro 2010 3D is a good alternative for less than $500. Toon Boom Studio 5 and Studio 6 are great for creating digital cartoon images. PM Animation is a shareware package that has plenty of functionality and applications, and FotoMorph Image Animation Software is free. WidgetCast 2.0 from Reallusion is expensive but is the ‘all singing, all dancing’ animation software package. To create good facial animated characters, Crazy Talk 6.0 Pro is a good buy for approximately $149.99, and they also do a Standard version for approximately $49.99.Before buying, think carefully about exactly what you want to animate, and then study the different types of software to make sure the one you decide on is right for the purpose you want it for. Software packages vary greatly in price, dependent on both ability and quality. If you can, seek professional advice and listen to recommendations.OTHER PLACES TO LEARNThe majority of schools, colleges and universities provide a range of courses regarding animation, be it computer generated, Cel animation, rotoscoping, stop motion, animated drawings or any other technique you wish to learn. There are also specialist courses that you can do if you want to specialise in a particular area, i.e. video game design. You don’t have to be a young to learn animation, you can start at any age and enjoy discovering the challenges and rewards of animation. The cost of courses, which vary in length from months to 3 years, will depend on what sort of level you wish to attain, and where you study.",
RC Cars,"RC Cars Information  Introduction Radio-controlled (R/C) cars are very popular hobbies for many. While there is a tendency to think of an R/C car as something for a child, the reality is that there are just as many adults who indulge in collecting these cars, and even racing them in various competitions. The cars are powered by several different sources and continually change based on newer technology. The toy-grade models are less expensive and are probably the ones with which most people are familiar—except collectors who are familiar with the hobby models and have the money to invest in these more expensive models. Both toy-grade and hobby grades are available; there are advantages and disadvantages to both just as there are advantages and disadvantages to both the electric-powered and fuel-powered models. 
Getting started with your RC Hobby With that comprehensive background on RC cars, let us look at how you can get started with this interesting hobby. Most beginners go for toy grade RCs and are almost always happy with those. But if you become serious about the hobby and decide to switch to hobby grade RC, there are six important factors to think about and these are: 1. Cost 2. Repair and maintenance 3. Time 4. Type of vehicle 5. Driving 6. Racing 

Here’s a quick look at each in turn: 

The cost factor 

RC toy vehicles are affordable, but hobby grade RCs can be expensive to buy as well as maintain as they are more complicated with more parts that might need replacing. Most hobby car enthusiasts really enjoy customizing their vehicles with parts such as tires, rims, motors, body kits, etc. The cost of these parts can add up to quite a substantial amount. You may be happy with an RC car that handles well and runs fast, but you will still incur the initial cost of the hobby grade RC vehicle. 

Repair and maintenance 

To ensure that your RC car is in top condition, you will need to take care of basic maintenance and repairs. This includes tuning the motor, adjusting the suspension, oiling gears, chassis alignment, repairing any dents, cracks and touching up paint work. It is quite like taking care of a real car, considering the parts involved. 

Time   You will need to devote time as well as patience to your RC hobby. Reading and understanding the various manuals and learning to assemble the parts can take up time. Even if you buy ready to run RCs, you will still need to learn how to operate them. 

Type of vehicle 

You must decide whether to buy or build your RC car. To get started quickly, the best way to go is to get an RTR or a ready to run model. With an RTR you don’t have to worry about assembling it. But if you enjoy tinkering with models and putting them together, then an unassembled kit is a good idea. Beginners find the gas powered RC car attractive, but electric models may be a good start as they are inexpensive and quiet and do not need too many accessories. You just have to switch them on to run them and they can be run indoors. These are powered by rechargeable batteries that make your vehicle run at a speed of 20-30 miles an hour with a ten minute running time depending on your speed and motor. 

Nitro cars burn real fuel and come with small engines similar to a lawn mowers’ and other equipment that use small engines. Your nitro truck will be as easy to put together and maintain as your electric powered vehicle. The nitro engine seems exciting because it is more realistic with real smoke, sound and smells from the exhaust. 

An electric kit needs many battery packs if you want to run it for half an hour to an hour. The nitro kit car owner must ensure that his transmitter and receiver batteries are enough and refuel the car every five or ten minutes. 

You can opt for an electric or nitro powered RC car. Nitro cars can only be run outdoors. Hobby grade RC cars are faster and more powerful than toy cars. Serious hobbyists go for the nitro-powered RC vehicles even if some electric cars seem to perform better. 

Gas cars are powered by internal combustion engines that give you a speed of 35-45 mph. people who are serious RC car hobbyists prefer gas engines for their intricacy and complexity. 

There are petrol powered kits like the Baja 5B buggy and 5T truck. Just like in a real car, these use petrol mixed with 2-cycle engine oil. These kits are quite big and measure almost a meter. They are also expensive, but this cost is balanced by the cost of fuel which is lower than nitro fuel. With a petrol kit, you only spend a few pennies an hour of running the car. Engine maintenance is also cheaper and involves less work. 

Driving 

Handling the speed and the power of RC hobby cars is something else, even if you are an expert at toy cars. You will need to practice your driving skills to make sure you are on track to avoid crashing or spinning out. The same goes for flying your RC hobby vehicle. 

Racing 

You may eventually decide to take part in professional RC hobby competitions. This is completely different from a friendly race in your backyard with friends. When you participate in competitions, you will be looking at the chance to win prizes, trophies, etc. and this means being a part of a serious sport that has rules and entry fees. 

There are people with just a couple of RC hobby cars that they modify, upgrade or tweak. Some people prefer to specialize in specific types of RC such as large scale models, micro models, vintage cars, boats, etc. Some prefer to go for the ready to run and some enjoy building their own vehicles from scratch. The approach you choose depends on how much time, money and interest you have. Obviously, it is all about having fun and there’s no such thing as a right or wrong way to enjoy this hobby. 

Should you join a club? 

When you take up the RC hobby, it is not mandatory to join a club, but getting together with a group will certainly take your enjoyment to a new level. You will also find active online groups that you can join and get tips and advice from. 
Where can you buy RC vehicles? You can buy your hobby RC cars, trucks, planes or boats from hobby stores or from manufacturers. The hobby grade kits come as RTR or ready to run, ARR or almost ready to run and kits with which you can assemble the entire vehicle on your own. As a beginner, RTR kits can be convenient for you since you can get started right away. They cost the same as the kits that need to be assembled and come with all you need, including the radio, the servo, the motor and a painted body. You just need to charge the batteries and fill the gas tank and you are good to go. It is a good idea to buy a spare pair of batteries and charger. Some good examples are the Schumacher mini buggy and mini stadium truck 4 WD RTR 1/18th models. What about ARRs? 

ARRs come completely assembled at the factory and you just need a screwdriver and needle nose pliers to put the finishing touch to it to get it going. A great example is the 1/10 Trinity TSpec 1:10th Touring Car which only needs a radio system to have it running. 
A word about Kits Most beginners wonder what type of kit they should buy. This depends on the kind of area you plan to run the vehicle in. So if you are trying to decide whether to buy an on-road or off-road kit, here’s what you need to know. On road kits can run at high speeds and resemble the race cars. They have an easy four-wheel drive with lifelike treaded tires and bodies. But they are not made for uneven terrain. You can get on road kits in electric and nitro versions in different sizes. Off road kits have larger tires and long shock absorbers and are good for rugged terrains. They can jump over obstacles easily and are good on race tracks and field. Off road kits also come as electric and nitro versions and two wheel and four wheel drive versions. You will enjoy the four wheel drive trucks as they are the most fun. Kits are generally not difficult to assemble since they come with comprehensive instructions and supplies. A good example is the XRAY T1 Factory Kit 1/10 scale luxury competition touring car. You can upgrade, customize and enjoy these vehicles and take part in racing competitions. The good thing about hobby grade replacement parts, upgrades and a range of accessories is that they are available years after the manufacturing date. Hobby grade vehicles handle much better and are faster than toy vehicles. 
Description of R/C Cars Radio-controlled (or R/C) cars are self-powered model cars or trucks that can be controlled from a distance using a specialized transmitter. The term ""R/C"" has been used to mean both ""remote controlled"" and ""radio controlled"", where ""remote controlled"" includes vehicles that are connected to their controller by a wire, but common use of ""R/C"" today usually refers to vehicles controlled by a radio-frequency link. This article focuses on radio-controlled vehicles only. 

These cars obtain their power from several different sources. The electric models have small and very powerful electric motors with rechargeable nickel-cadmium, nickel metal hydride or lithium polymer cells. Some other models may use brushed or brushless electric motors. Most of the models that operate on fuel use glow-plug engines which are small internal combustion engines. The fuel component is a special combination of nitromethane, methanol and oil (usually a blend of castor oil and synthetic oil). 

Some models have recently been introduced that are rather large in size. Their source of power is a small gasoline engine that is similar to the motors you see on string trimmers and use a mixture of oil and gasoline. For novice operators it is advisable to work with one of the electric models rather than the fuel-driven ones although even these models become more complex if you purchase the more expensive ones for those who possess more skill. 

It doesn’t matter whether you choose electric or fuel-driven R/C cars; both are available for both on-road and off-road operation. You want to keep in mind that off-road models have fully-functional suspensions that allow you to use them on different types of terrain; on-road models do not have this capability and must be operated strictly on smooth and paved surfaces. 
Types of R/C Cars
Toy-grade radio control The term ""toy"" or ""toy-grade"" in regards to radio control cars is used to describe vehicles of the pre-assembled type generally found in discount stores and consumer electronics stores.
Hobby-grade radio control In recent years, hobby-grade ""ready-to-run"" (or ""RTR"") models have become available from every major manufacturer of radio-controlled cars, attracting many hobbyists who would otherwise have purchased a pre-assembled car (ARTR or Race-Roller). Vehicles of this type need little or no final assembly and in most cases, the bodies are shipped painted and trimmed, requiring little or no work from the owner before they can be used (other than purchasing and installing batteries).  
Electric models The electric models used to operate using brushed motors, but these are becoming less popular because brushless models have more power and do not need as much maintenance as car possessing brushed motors. While the motors are rated in relative terms with a Kv number, the true ability of the motor to send power to the car depends on the quality of the batteries the operator uses as well as the wires and connectors that supply power to the motor. Because of the power element in a brushless motor, they are also used in the larger size monster trucks and the 1/8 nitro-powered buggies that have been converted from fuel power to electric motors. It is possible to find some 1/5 scale gas to electric conversions, but they are not very popular because of their high price.  
Fuel models The size of most fuel engines will range from .12-.35 cubic inches based on restrictions placed by the governing bodies for radio-controlled racing. It is possible to find engines that do not meet these specifications, and because they will not be used in any sanctioned races, it is unnecessary for them to comply with the regulations placed on sanctioned races. The size of the engine is relative to the class of the car: 1/10th scale for both on and off road cars that have .12-.18 cubic inch engines and 1/8 scale for those using .21-.32 cubic inch engines. There are certainly exceptions; nothing in engine size is engraved in stone. For instance, many Schumacher and Thunder Tiger/Team Associated RC models include much larger engines as art of standard equipment on some models. 

Model cars that use fuel-powered engines have the capability to reach moderate speed without any type of modifications. The cars will achieve maximum power at medium to high speeds but with a slower throttle response than models operating on electrical power. This difference in response is because of clutching and a lack of torque. Electric motors are designed to produce immediate torque, but both nitro and full-sized gasoline engines need time for the engine to spool and the clutch to engage. On the down side, electric engines require the operator to remove the body shell and battery fasteners to recharge the battery while fuel-powered cars can be returned to operation within just a few seconds. You can also operate nitro cars continuously without the need to take breaks so they can cool down. Of course, this is taking into consideration they are properly tuned. 

One of the good things about nitro-powered cars is they operate like full-sized fuel vehicles by using a two stroke engine rather than the electric motor that operates electric powered cars. Nitro enthusiasts are drawn to the sound of the engine and the higher stock top speeds, but unfortunately you will find unburned oil in their exhaust which will place a coating on the chassis. This fact will cause the necessity for more cleaning than the owner would need to do for an electrical engine. The cleaning process is achieved using compressed air nozzles and some type of solvent such as denatured alcohol. You must keep your vehicle in top notch condition by properly tuning it. This means you must learn to maintain the highest performance and fuel economy, keeping engine wear and overheating to a minimum even if you have one of the ready-to-run vehicles. If you try to operate a nitro-fuel motor when it is not operating at its best you not only run the risk of reducing its performance when it is most crucial but you can cause damage even under ordinary circumstances.  
Disadvantages of a nitro-fuel motor While nitro-powered motors provide higher stock performance and allow you to operate them for longer periods of time, there is also the tendency for great mechanical wear over time than you would experience with the electric counterpart. 

The higher speed and weight that accompanies fuel-powered vehicles usually causes higher speed collision which in turn causes more damage to the vehicles involved in the collision. This is turn leads to more safety concerns, something you must consider when you are attempting to decide whether to choose an electric or gas powered model. 

The various maintenance tasks such as cleaning the air filter, general chassis cleaning, replacing clutch parts as they wear out, lubrication after running the vehicle (essential before storing the vehicle) and maintenance of other parts such as the glow plug can be quite frustrating for the novice RC user. 

Another disadvantage of nitro-fueled cars is their motors must be rebuilt after you run approximately 2-8 gallons of fuel through the engine. This is caused by a loss of compression, and poor tuning and overeating can accelerate the problem. You can also cause serious engine damage if you over-rev any engine when it lacks load or ingestion of dirt in the carburetor. In short, this means there is a higher maintenance factor in maintaining a nitro-powered engine compared to an electric-powered one.  
Gas-powered models Gasoline powered vehicles, also known as ""fuelies"" or ""gassers"", run on premixed gasoline and oil. They cost much more (usually $800–$3000 RTR) than nitro and electric cars. They are also much bigger and therefore require much more space to run. They do not usually have as high top end speeds (compared to nitro and some electrics) but have lots of power and do not take a lot of fuel to run. 
Advantages and Disadvantages of Toy-Grade Radio Controlled Cars
Advantages One of the main advantages of toy grade radio controlled vehicles is one of cost. A hobbyist can purchase a medium-scale toy R/C for approximately $50-$100 cheaper than an entry-level hobby class car with an electric engine. Cars in the toy class are easy to use, have speeds usually under 20 mph thus decreasing the level of potential danger, and they are easier to set up than the easiest ready-to-run hobby class vehicle. 

Vehicles in the toy class are usually designed to look like real cars with features that many vehicles in the hobby class lack such as lights that operate, sounds, windows, doors, and hoods the user can open, and interiors that are quite realistic albeit at the expense of weight and durability. Some toy class vehicles also have sound systems with radios or MP3 players that actually work. Toy class R/C vehicles are available in many different designs including common models of cars and trucks, tanks, bulldozers, motorcycles and even an array of odd vehicles that have rather uncommon and unorthodox designs.  
Disadvantages While the cost factor is an important selling point for toy class R/C vehicles, it is important for potential users to keep in mind they are usually manufactured with a focus on design combined with the need to maintain low production costs. For instance, hobby-grade cars have standardized motors with separate electronic components that a user can replace individually if they happen to fail; toy-grade cars usually have non-standard motors with chassis components that are not replaceable and a single electronic circuit board that is built right into the vehicle’s design. This makes most models other than Nikko and Radio Shack models difficult or impossible to repair. This means when one component on the vehicle stops working, the entire vehicle becomes unusable. 

Toy-grade vehicles also suffer from poor performance. Most have engines that are small and weak, powered mostly by alkaline or NiCad batteries thus limiting their top speeds to 5-15 mph. The batteries do not last very long and require frequent replacement. Very few come with any kind of a suspension, and those models that do happen to feature some kind of suspension system include one that has a very primitive or simplistic design. The steering is usually non-proportional and includes only three positions: straight, full left and full right. They usually lack a proportional throttle as well with the only options offered being stop and go. 
Accessories It is necessary to purchase additional accessories for all R/C models. Electrical vehicles require battery packs and a charger for the battery pack. These are necessary to provide power to the car and are not usually included when you purchase the vehicle. It is also important to have a soldering iron and other supplies for those who wish to build high-performance battery packs or upgrade the initial electronics with low-resistance connectors. The most popular battery for RC cars is the Li-Polymer Battery with a hard case; the battery has an output of 7.4 volts.   A glow plug heater is essential to start the engine in nitro-powered vehicles. You will also need 4 AA batteries or a rechargeable 6-volt 5-cell battery pack in order to operate the electronics in the vehicle. It is also necessary to have a pullstart, starterbox, battery operated rotostart of an electric drill to crank the engine of nitro vehicles. Another requirement for operating nitro-powered RC cars is expensive model fuel, spare glow plugs, and post-operational oil. 

For those who operate gasoline-powered vehicles, the only accessories necessary are a receiver battery pack and a way to start the engine such as the pullstart which is usually included. If you are purchasing a hobby grade vehicle you will probably need 8 AA batteries in order to operate the transmitter although there are a few models that will operate on a rechargeable transmitter pack or rechargeable AA batteries. 

There are many sources available for operators who wish to upgrade or increase the performance of their hobby grade cars. These parts allow the user to do everything from simply making improvements to the vehicle that will increase the life of R/C car parts to making improvements to the overall performance. Many users of hobby grade vehicles perform their own upgrades by searching classified advertisements and online forums. 

For those who are interested in starting right away, you can purchase “ready-to-run” R/C cars. This means when they leave the factory they are already tuned for optimum racing performance and do not need any additional adjustments. If you choose to purchase one of these “ready-to-run” vehicles you will still need to inspect them before operation in order to make sure there are no loose parts. Another way to purchase R/C vehicles is to purchase them in kit form or choose models that are partially assembled. It will then be necessary for the owner to complete building the car and tuning it before he uses it the first time. In most cases, however, the owner will need to purchase radio gear and sometimes even the car’s engine when he buys a kit. 
Where can you run or race your car or truck? When you buy your hobby RC car or kit, make your decision based on the area you live in, where you can run your car or truck. To run your car, you will need a paved surface like open parking lots at, say, the local school, church, office complex etc. For trucks, any type of surface is good as they are capable of handling dirt tracks and other types of terrain. If you have open fields, vacant lots or construction yards are good locations to race or run your truck. You might need to get permission first, though, if they are private property. 

If you have a friend you may enjoy getting used to running your hobby car around your area, up and down your street. Gradually you may decide you want the excitement of racing and competing with others. Once you have your own racing group, you can probably find a parking lot that is vacant to get going.",
Competitive Eating,"Competitive Eating Information  Introduction Competitive eating is on the rise as a popular hobby and spectator sport. There are websites listing all of the contests going on within a certain time span. These advocate almost 100 major contests specializing in the consumption of everything from hot dogs to tiramisu. Some of the more popular eaters have their own fan clubs, sparked by the fame achieved from starring in these ever increasingly popular contests with purses of over 20,000 dollars. Here is a look at the world of competitive eating. 
Rules Competitive eating contests often have eight, 10, 12 or 15 minute time limits. Eaters are often allowed to dunk foods in water or other liquids in order to soften the food and make it easier to chew and swallow. 

There is one fairly disgusting issue that must be considered with competitive eating. What if someone can’t hold all that food and they throw up? The IFOCE rules are decided about this issue, and thankfully, they are quite tactful about the words that they use to discuss someone who has vomited. A contestant who has ""a Roman incident"" will be disqualified if any such incident comes in contact with the contestant’s plate or the table. Once time is up, competitors can handle the contents of their stomach in any manner they choose. 

While it can occasionally lead to controversy, the decision of the judges is final in the contest. For example, in 2002 at the Nathan’s Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, the current record holder Takeru Kobayashi reportedly had a Roman incident involving a bit of hot dog but managed to hold it back with his hands until the time ran out. 
Tips And Tricks Many competitive eaters break their food into smaller pieces before eating it. The logic behind this is that the competitor will not have to chew as much and it also allows them to fit more food in their mouth at one time. The ""Solomon Technique"" (also known as ""Japanesing"") is where a hot dog is broken in half, making it possible to shove the whole dog into the competitor’s mouth at one time. For hot dog eating contests, most serious eaters will eat the bun and the hot dog separately. 

Dunking, which was mentioned earlier in this article, is practiced by almost all competitors. Dunking the food lubricates it and makes it soft, so that it is much easier to chew and swallow. 

Before a competition, be sure to eat low-fat, high-fiber and water-filled foods that take a long time to digest like cabbage, celery and pineapple. The more food you have going to your stomach, the more it will stretch and the more you will be able to fit in your stomach during an event. 

Never starve yourself before a competition. This will make your stomach shrink, which is the opposite of what you’ve been training for. 

During a competition, be sure to keep your pace. If you slow down, your body will begin to fight against you and it will be more difficult to continue. It’s very important to keep your eating rhythm while you are competing. 

After the competition is over, you will feel sick. The adrenaline will slow down and your stomach will definitely hurt. 

Competitive eating is mostly a battle of willpower. Competitive eaters must learn to fight their gag reflexes and their stomach`s natural reaction to an unnatural amount of food being piled into it very quickly. 
FAQ’s Q. Are All Serious Competitive Eaters Men? A. No, Competitive eating is not just for the guys. One of the top champs is Sonya Thomas, a Virginia native who holds the record for eating in chicken wings, (167) chicken nuggets, (80 in five minutes) and she also is the champ for cheesecake, (11 pounds in nine minutes). 

Q. Which Competitors Do Better In Competition, Lean Or Fat? A. According to the International Federation of Competitive Eating, the more physically fit eaters are more likely to do well. There is a theory out there, known as the belt of fat theory. It does not have a lot of academic support, but it states that the fat that is situated around the stomach limits the stomach’s ability to expand. So, it stands to reason that a fit person with less fat around their stomach would be able to fit more in their stomachs than a fatter person would. Some of the top competitors are very small people, in fact. Takeru Kobayashi weighs in at 132 pounds, Sonya Thomas, mentioned above, weighs 105 and Richard LeFevre checks in the same as Kobayashi, 132 pounds. 

Q. How Much Money Can Be Made In Competitive Eating? A. The International Federation of Competitive Eating offers over 200 events with about a total of $ 400,000 in prize money to be had. This really isn’t what you could count on to pay your bills. However, over the past few years, the money offered has seen a notable rise. The IFOCE is seeing a growing industry, with fierce competitions and competitors. It’s a far cry from when the only prize was the glory and whatever food you could consume. The sport is seeing other federations cropping up, such as the Association of Independent Competitive Eaters, which has its own heroes to uphold. Both associations are working hard to promote their best eaters as spokespeople for the sport. It has been reported that Takeru Kobayashi made about 150,000 dollars in one year from eating contests. 

Q. What Kind Of Foods Are Typically Found At The Competitions? A. There is a bill of standard fare associated with food eating contests. Pizza, chicken in various forms, and of course, the hot dog is perhaps the best known. This does not mean that is all there is out there. Anything can be a part of an eating contest. For instance, butter was Donald Lerman’s winning food, when he ate seven sticks in five minutes. Takeru Kobayashi plowed through 17 pounds of cow brains in 15 minutes. For the win, Oleg Zhornitskiy sucked down 128 ounces of mayonnaise in eight minutes. 
Notable Record Holders While we have mentioned several record holders in this article, here is a summary of a few of the greats- 

• Joe Chestnut, 103 Krystal burgers in eight minutes • Sonya Thomas, 14 and a quarter ounces of fruitcake in 10 minutes. • Eric Booker, 49 glazed doughnuts in eight minutes • Richard LeFevre, (who, by the way, was 65 at the time) six pounds of Spam in 12 minutes. • Dale Boone, 274 Russian dumplings in six minutes. • Juliet Lee, 13 and one half pounds of cranberry sauce. • Crazy Legs Conti, five and a half pounds of buffet food in 12 minutes. • Tim Janus, 141 pieces of Nigiri sushi in six minutes. 
Dangers Some of the dangers connected to competitive eating are viable concerns and should be taken seriously. While some of the most successful competitors engage in intensive training, all that is before the contest. What anyone else sees is a bunch of adults stuffing their faces with hot dogs, lobsters or cabbages amid a cheering crowd? It is this atmosphere that is causing worry among many dieticians. Competitive eating is said to send messages to the crowd that eating as much as you can as fast as you can is not a problem. 

Medical professionals are concerned that it can exacerbate other problems, such as causing someone with an undiagnosed ulcer to develop a perforation in their stomach. 

Training by taking in large amounts of water can cause water intoxication. This is a deadly result of the dilution of electrolytes in the blood. 

The stuffing of one’s stomach can lead to vomiting. If the competitor vomits regularly (either during a competition or after) they have an increased chance of getting food in their lungs, which can lead to pneumonia. 
Conclusion Competitive eating can indeed be a profitable and fun hobby. Take care to make sure you are healthy, train your body to handle the tremendous influx of food, and stay fit the rest of the time that you are not competing.",
Jazz,"Jazz Information  Introduction: Jazz music, a music form often called America’s classical music and originated back in the 1800s in the south. This African American form of music is one of the oldest and most beloved in America. Popular all over the world, it has the distinction of influencing all kinds of music. Jazz has the uniqueness of being completely flexible and this is what makes it appealing to music lovers of any age. Today, even electronic DJs and hip hop artists include popular jazz music in their repertoire. 

Jazz has a strong rhythmic base with blues notes, solos and the ‘call and response’ pattern. One of its specialties is its ability for improvisation. Thus we have jazz music, a constantly innovating musical form made greater by artists such as Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday and so many more. These outstanding musicians have not only inspired and influenced musicians of today but have also helped develop a strong interest in the history of music in today’s music fans. 

The sounds of jazz spread over the US around the 1920s especially in New York and Chicago. The flexibility of jazz allowed musicians to combine the piano for the ‘ragtime’ feel to the existing sounds. In Europe, James Reece improvised with a whole orchestra, bringing in a fresh flavor to this music genre. 

Jazz is still the most favorite form of music in Kansas City, Memphis and New Orleans where it all started, but it is obvious to see what a wide influence it has over contemporary music. If you listen to bands like Cherry Poppin’ Daddies, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, Big Bad Voo Doo Daddy, etc. you will hear the kind of jazz sounds enjoyed by the present generation.   The question that often arises is “What exactly is Jazz”. There are many stories related to the origin of the word Jazz, and we know that there are plenty of elements that come together to make up this unusual but beautiful music form. Yet, there is no way you can define Jazz because it is something that you experience with your senses. Today there are many types and styles of jazz and you can see its influence on different genres of music in jazz rock, latin jazz, acid jazz, fusion jazz and lots more. 
So, what is Jazz? Jazz is America’s very own musical art form. Jazz has its origins in the beginning of the 20th century from the Afro-Americans. It also has the influence of European and Afro-American culture. One thing we can say for sure – there are so many styles and players in jazz music, that there is something to please every musical preference. 
The History Of Jazz And How It Evolved As we said earlier, Jazz has its origins in the US in the early 1900s. For a century following its beginnings, jazz has evolved from ragtime, to the blues to the big band and Bebop to become an inherent part of the Afro-American tradition. Jazz specifically has its roots in New Orleans, Chicago and New York City where it is as alive as on the day it was born. 

Let us now trace a quick timeline in the history of jazz: 

Around the 1700s 

Music is in the blood of African Americans. Jazz can be tracked back to those days of slavery when the ‘call and response’ style was popular. The slaves developed this to make their work life more interesting. There was a song leader who would sing a line and the others would respond to this call. The slaves also sang spiritual songs to express their religious beliefs and to voice their wish for freedom. These went on to form the foundation of jazz. Around the 1800s 

In the 1800s many Europeans immigrated to America bringing their musical traditions with them in the form of Irish gigs, German waltzes, French quadrilles, etc. It was during this time that Scott Joplin, the afro amercian composer experimented with the European style, combining them with the African rhythm and melody. This came to be known as ragtime. 

In the 1900s 

New Orleans, with its multi-cultural population, has the credit for its role in the growth of Jazz music during the twentieth century. It was a magical time when new cultures merged to come up with ‘Jazz’ as it is called today. Jazz was thus a result of the union of African American music, European music, blues, ragtime, marching band, etc. 

1920s 

During this time, the African Americans moved to Chicago and New York in search of a better life. They brought the divine Jazz with them, which was loved by the locals. People danced to jazz and blues. It was time when radios and record players were available, helping in the growth of Jazz. The music spread all over America, thanks to the radio, dance halls and record players. 

1930s 

The 1930s saw the birth of ‘big band swing’ a new energetci jazz form which became very popular during the next two decades. Swing was the dance music of this time. 

1940s 

It was World War II and a majority of the African amercian musicians were drafted into the army. There were hardly any musicians to play at the dance halls. 

1950s 

Television came into our lives and became a major source of entertainment. The dance halls became less important and began to close. It was also a time when rock n roll and Elvis Presley took the young generation by storm. 

1960s 

The 1960s saw the rebellion of the African American jazz artists against record companies owned by the whites, controlling their income as a result. They broke free to take hold of their own destiny and music. 

From the 1970s to the present day Jazz has constantly evolved and adopted new forms throughout the century and the 1970s was the time for fusion. The 1980s saw the birth of acid jazz and classic blues while the 1990s reveled in smooth jazz and retro swing. 

Today, jazz is seen as an eternal music form that thrives and flourishes in the musical taste of music lovers of all ages. 
The Elements That Make Jazz So Special Jazz is similar to other styles of music in many ways, yet the way these elements are handled in jazz is completely unique. Here is an overview of these elements vis-à-vis jazz music:  
Interpretation The way a jazz music player handles a melody is called interpretation. Being a flexible form of music, practically any melody can be interpreted with jazz by adding triplets to the basic beat. This is called swinging. Most of the music we hear is just the opposite, with a straight eighth note. For a jazz musician, it is very important to have the ability to do this – swing the beat with triplets.  
Improvisation: As with any music form, improvisation requires a lot of dexterity and creativity. To be a truly great musician, improvisation is the one critical element that they need to master. To be able to improvise, the musician must have the ability to not only compose but also revise, edit and perform on the spot. The greatness of a jazz player is evaluated by this element, since it involves a lot of instinct combined with ability.  
Rhythm As we mentioned earlier, jazz music shows features similar to other types of music, and the difference lies in the way that jazz treats these features. Of these, one is rhythm. Jazz uses syncopation and this differentiates it because it accentuates the music unexpectedly and this could be on a part of the beat or measure. Syncopation lends variety to the music.  
Tempo In Jazz music, tempo tends to be even and steady from the moment the melody starts until it ends. 

While playing jazz music, the players choose from two forms of musical styles at the time of improvising. These are the blues and the AABA tune. The blues are usually the favourite since it is a stylized form with 12 measures of music. You will find blues that are 8 or 16 measures long, but it is the 12 measure variety that’s most preferred. That said, blues is easy to improvise on since the basic blues has 3 chords with the player playing on the one blues sc ale. 

Most popular jazz music is based on the AABA tune. It is more complex than the blues and calls for more in-depth theoretical and practical knowledge. The AABA tune has 4 phrases, each 8 measures long and while the A phrases are similar; the B acts as a bridge between the As. 
Different Jazz Styles Thanks to its constantly evolving state, jazz music can be broadly classified into the following styles: 

Ragtime 

Ragtime is the first ever jazz music which originated back in the 1800s and was meant for the piano. Energetic, ragtime is reminiscent of the African dance style. Scot Joplin’s ragtime compositions are legendary. 

The Blues 

The Blues is significant in jazz music as it has a major influence on it. Blues basically originated as a vocal expression of the Afro-Americans working in the fields in the early 1900s. Blues singers used the guitar, harmonica and piano as the accompanying instruments. W C Handy is called the father of Blues music. Other blues legends are Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, and the like. 

Dixieland 

Dixieland, traditional or New Orleans jazz found its beginnings in the early 1920s at a time when the blues, ragtime and brass band were popular. Dixieland jazz used trumpet-cornet, clarinet, trombone, and the saxophone as accompanying instruments. Distinctive since there was no vocalist, the rhythm part of this kind of jazz also used the banjo tuba, drums, piano or string bass. Some Dixieland legends are trumpeters Louis Armstrong and Bix Beiterbecke and pianist Jelly Roll Morton. 

Big Band 

Also popular in the 1920s at the same time as Dixieland, Big Band jazz had an ensemble of more than ten players on the saxophone, bass, trumpets, guitar, piano and drums. These musicians together created the swing style of jazz that was great to dance to. Popular Big Band jazz artists are Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Paul Whiteman. 

Bebop 

The 1940s saw Bebop, as a natural extension of Big Band jazz. Yet Bebop was very different since it had only 4 – 6 players. Its specialty was complex tunes and chord progressions, so not really the best dance music. But it gave birth to ‘scat’ which converted meaningless words into improvised melodies. Trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie is a Bebop icon. 

Free Jazz 

Free Jazz grew in the 1960s. It was highly unique in its pitch and tonal quality and played by very few musicians like Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor, etc. Now let us take a look at some of the all time greats in Jazz music. 
All Time Great Jazz Artists Jazz music has given rise to hundreds of all-time great musicians. Any talk of jazz music is impossible without mentioning Charlie Christian, known for his innovation with the guitar as his solo instrument. Almost all jazz musicians adopt some of Christian’s techniques. 

Next comes Wes Montgomery, who had the natural knack of playing just about any melody, no matter how difficult, with ease. He soloed in single notes, octaves and chord fragments, using a heavy tone and thumb stroke to produce the distinctive sounds so beloved to his fans. Many people consider Wes Montgomery as their all time favourite guitar and jazz artist. 

Miles Davis, a boxer, was an original lyrical soloist and known as the most consistently innovative jazz musician from the 1940s to the 1960s. 

Barney Kessel was much sought after jazz musician who was highly proficient on the electric guitar. He performed with legends like Artie Shaw and Oscar Peterson. With is smooth west coast style, Kessel also played with Herb Ellis and Charlie Byrd. Herb Ellis is known for his Bebop style jazz and western swing and was a great guitarist. He played with Oscar Peterson, Ella Fitzgerald and many more. 

The list of legendary jazz musicians is very long with Django Reinhardt, Jim Hall, Louis Armstrong, Kenny Burrell, Pat Martino, Pat Metheny, Al Di Meola, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman, who gave the world jazz music as we know it today, in all its glory.",
Fencing,"Fencing Information  Introduction Just the thought of fencing usually brings up images of days gone by with dashing men in leggings, capes, boots and feathered hats fighting to protect a damsel in distress. While historically much more serious in nature than many movies and writings portray, there was always a poetry of movement as well as a distinct code of conduct used in fencing and sword work throughout history. 

In modern fencing there is still the same sense of athleticism and artistry, but safety and protection of the combatants is also paramount in the sport. Both men and women can learn to fence and many programs are available for children as well. Fencing is still a very popular sport in Europe as well as in North America with training offered through specialized schools as well as through classes and self-instruction programs. 
Terminology The sport of fencing also has some very unique terms that designate specific footwork and body positions as well as what is known as blade work. Getting to know these terms, which are taken from a variety of languages including Spanish, English and French, is sometimes a bit challenging. However, knowing a few basics is all that is required to get started in watching or learning this fascinating sport. 

The following are important terms to understand when watching a fencing match or learning about the sport: 
Terms Foil – a very lightweight, thin weapon the foil is blunted at the end but otherwise very traditional in shape and styling. It is can be either traditional, also known as dry or steam, or it can also be electrical. Electrical foils allow scoring when they touch the vest that triggers either a point of the hit is in a target area or just records a touch if it is outside of the target area. The target area is basically the torso with the arms and head excluded. 

Épée – most substantial than the foil, it is still considered a thrusting weapon . Like the foil it is now used in the electric form for scoring in most competitions. It can have a standard grip or a pistol grip and has a much larger scoring area than a competition using a foil. 

Sabre – the largest of the weapons the sabre is considered a cutting weapon and therefore not just the end of the blade is used for scoring. It is a bit stiffer in the blade than the foil but still moves easily from side to side and is not a fixed blade. The target area when using this weapon is everything above the waist. 

Advance – this is the traditional movement used to move forward, front foot first followed by the body. The weapon is held forward parallel to the ground. 

Lunge – the most common forward movement in the attack the lunge basically places the front foot flat and forward, knee bent, with the weight of the body and the thrust of the weapon following with the straightening of the rear leg. The torso and head are held erect giving the look of power and control in the attack. 

Reprise – a second attack that comes very quickly following a lunge. It is a quick maneuver that often is designed to counter a parried initial thrust. 

Attack – extending the arm holding the weapon towards the opponent with an intent to make a connection with the target area. 

Bind – forcing the attacker`s blade to opposite direction by using the guard and forte of the defender`s blade. 

Right-of-way- when two points are scored at the same time the individual that started the attack has right-of-way which means only his or her point will count. If you bend or break the position of the arm in the attack you may lose right-of-way and leave yourself open to a counter-attack. 

Counter-Attack – an attack that occurs after the opponent began an attack. It is a new action, not a result of a self-defensive movement. Depending on the type of competition it may result in a loss of right-of-way for the opponent if ""breaking the arm"" occurs. 

Riposte – the attack immediately after deflecting or parrying the initial attack. It is a new move, not a continuation of the parry. 

Salute – before and after the bout or competition each participant will salute the judges, each other and the other`s involved in the operation of the tournament by touching their blade to their head. At the end of the match opponents will typically also shake hands in addition to saluting. In some competitions refusing to salute at the beginning or end of the bout results in lost points. 

Cards – yellow and black cards are used to indicate penalties in the match. Black cards result in immediate expulsion from the event and is typically only given when disregard for safety is noted. 

There are many very specific terms used in fencing that are unique to the sport. Reading, viewing online videos with commentary or watching online or televised fencing bouts and matches is a terrific way to become familiar with these unusual and very exotic sounding terms. 
Equipment For those just starting out equipment can be supplied by the trainer or training facility, but having your own isn`t going to be costly. For training and non-competitive events the typical clothing for fencing is a cotton or nylon and is uniformly and traditionally white in color. Instructors can wear all black uniforms in very traditional types of events and competitions. Instructors also wear less padding and often heavier protection since they are much more likely to be struck in non-approved positions when working with novice students. New rules in competitions allow some variations in uniform colors from the traditional black and white and even allow some sponsorship advertising in very specific areas and sizes on the uniforms. In competitive events Kevlar or other puncture resistant fabrics such as Dyneema are required to prevent injury in matches. 

The basic clothing includes a chest protector, which is lightweight plastic, which provides puncture prevention over the lungs. Women are required to wear this protector while men have the option to wear it or not. Over this a pastron is worn which protects the area immediately under the armpit of the sword arm to prevent a parried sword from possibly slipping between the protection of the jacket when the arm is raised in the attack position. 

Over both of these items is the form fitting jacket. This jacket is held down in place by a strap that goes between the legs and attaches to the front and back of the jacket. The jacket has an extra fold along the throat area to provide protection and prevents the tip of the blade from sliding up the jacket to hit the neck. When competing in electronically scored bouts and matches there is an additional lamé or very lightweight electronically conductive material that goes over the jacket to designate the target hit areas for scoring. Any hits outside of the lamé do not score and are not counted. 

The sword had wears a glove both for grip and protection. The glove has a wider, long sleeve worn over the sleeve of the jacket that stops the blade from sliding up under the arm of the jacket and injuring the skin. 

Long socks that go up to the thighs are worn under the breeches. The breeches are held in place by suspenders and are tight around the tops of the calves just under the knee. Shoes are flat and are specially designed to support the foot from front to back when lunging and moving rapidly. The soles are not typically gripped to maximize the fencer`s ability to move fluidly over the mats. 

A mesh metal mask is also mandatory with the bib also very strong and made of a heavy duty plastic. In some types of competitions a newer visor type of face mesh can be used instead of the traditional metal mesh. The metal mesh mask is worn during practice and is typically not removed, just the face protector flipped up when the individual is not practicing, sparring or competing. 
Training And Classes There are some private classes for fencing available in most major urban areas, sometimes in conjunction with colleges, sporting clubs and private fencing groups. Since there is a definite style and flow of movement in a fencing match it is important to consider taking lessons to develop the form that is required. Learning things the wrong way can actually cause you more problems, especially if you ever want to reach the level of competition. 

Many classes that are offered for children and adults provide all equipment necessary, at least at the novice and first levels. Once individuals get into the sport buying your own equipment and even having specially made weapons is highly recommended for competitive levels. 

Within the United States there are three divisions of NCAA sanctioned fencing teams from a variety of Universities and colleges. Often these universities and colleges also offer training to the community or may be involved in working with youth training programs through schools or through summer camps and training opportunities. While typically focused on the eastern to central part of the country there are also programs in the southern and western states as well. 
Conclusion If you want to combine athletic ability with high levels of very artistic types of competition then fencing is a sport or hobby you should definitely consider. Although not as popular as it once was, fencing continues to be a great sport for teaching a wide variety of skills including balance, control, sportsmanship as well as individual skill development and teamwork. Popular in both the United Kingdom and Scotland, fencing continues to draw new people to the sport around the world. 

Getting started in fencing isn`t costly or time consuming, but it does require a commitment to learn and to focus in on all aspects of the sport. Working with an instructor in private lessons, joining a fencing club or group or taking a course is highly recommended right from the first move you attempt. While you can learn on your own from DVD`s, self-instruction videos and even online tutorials getting the correct form often requires someone to evaluate your position and moves and give you helpful, positive and encouraging feedback.",

Whether you were inspired by the great Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson, your enjoyment is guaranteed with boxing as a hobby. 
Getting started To get started with boxing as a hobby, the first thing you would be focusing on as a beginner is, conditioning, followed by boxing skills. Nutrition also plays a major role since you will need to build up a high level of fitness. Your trainer will help you develop a boxing routine based on your skill and fitness level. Here is an overview of each of these aspects. 

Conditioning In boxing, conditioning plays a critical role, since it is all about lasting in the ring and recovering quickly. As mentioned earlier, boxing gives you the ultimate body workout, covering everything you need including aerobic and anaerobic fitness, speed, agility, power, strength training and more, all in a systematically planned manner. 

Boxing skills To get to the stage of playing in the ring, whether it is for amateur or professional boxing, you have to develop boxing skills. This is done through practice drills that include various boxing moves. Then, you will learn how and when to use these moves effectively. 

Nutrition You need the right nutrition to ensure that you are in perfect physical shape to make good use of the skills you learn. Nutrition is like fuel which your body will take advantage of, in order to help you show results from your training. Remember, that eating more calories than you burn will make you put on weight. If you eat less, you lose weight. You will need to take the help of a dietician to help you plan the right amount of nutrients, vitamins, proteins, carbs, fat, etc. 

Boxing routine Your trainer will help you plan and implement a boxing routine that includes workouts, a proper nutrition plan, rest and self discipline. 
Beginners’ equipment to get started As a beginner, you need the right equipment to get started, so that you perform well, and safely. You can get started with the basic beginners’ equipment comprising: • Bag gloves – which will help you box with speed and skill. Boxing gloves are larger than bag mitts and come with thumb protection. These are useful in heavy workouts for toning and building muscles and sparring. 

• Hand wraps – to support your wrist and hand from excessive impact. Quick wraps are considered better than hand wraps. 

• Anklets – which support your ankle so that you are stable and protected from rolling. For extra support, you may need boxing boots 

• You will need a mouth guard to protect your teeth and jaw while sparring. When you clamp down on the mouth guard, your jaw gets immobilized so that you are protected from impact. It also helps you in developing your breathing techniques as it prevents you from breathing via the mouth and makes you use your nose. 

• Head gear and groin guards protect your head and groin when you spar. 

• A speed bag, which is an inflated ball suspended from a back board helps in building hand eye coordination to improve your blocking and parrying. 

• A heavy bag during training helps you develop punches and kicks while helping you condition for power, building your stamina and aerobic fitness. 

• With a floor to ceiling ball you can develop your hand eye coordination, balance, punching skills and peripheral vision since it is a moving target. 

• A skipping rope or jump rope is essential equipment as you can improve your footwork, shoulder strength and stamina. You start by bouncing lightly on the balls of your feet building up your speed and foot spacing, while breathing properly and rhythmically. 

• Medicine balls are used by boxers to build their core stability. 

• Clothes in the form of a singlet and shorts for proper heat transfer and easy movements. You’ll need a towel. You could probably wear track pants and a t shirt, but the right attire helps. 

• Water bottle for hydration. 
Learning to box Once you gear yourself, you will need to find a good trainer. As with any sport, professional training can be expensive and the fee varies depending on the trainer. For starters you can also get an introductory session with a trainer to get an idea of what the sport is all about. Based on how you feel, you can make the decision about whether you want to continue. 

You must remember that boxing is a sport that can be dangerous. It is important to check with your trainer to know whether he has adequate insurance and experience. You might want to find out whether the trainer has certification from a recognized boxing organization. Make sure the trainer can guide you properly in terms of nutrition and time management, equipment you need and the proper techniques. 

You can also talk to friends and family to find suitable trainers. If there are boxing gyms in your area, these can be useful in directing you towards a good trainer. 

When you start boxing, you will need to follow the right techniques and safety measures. You must use your boxing equipment properly. The boxing workouts will include pad work, punching bag work and sparring, footwork practice, skipping, cardio and strength training. Your training can also suggest resistance training, core strengthening and flexibility exercises. 
Basic Boxing techniques Stance, footwork and making the fist When you begin boxing training you begin by understanding the posture for your hand and wrist so that you make the fist in the right way to punch effectively, avoiding getting hurt. As far as the stance goes, you need to stand naturally with your lead foot pointing at your target and your back foot off at 45 degrees. You stand upright with your head tucked between the lead shoulders, with your chin down. Your stance must be feet and shoulder width apart with most of your weight on the front foot and the remaining on the back foot. The rear power hand is at the jaw line, and the front jabbing hand is at cheek height in front. Your body must be slightly forward, elbows in. 

If you happen to be right handed (orthodox), your left hand is the lead hand and right hand, the rear hand. If you happen to be a left handed boxer (southpaw), then your right hand is the lead hand and left hand the rear hand. 

Maintaining your balance for pad training Footwork is an important part of boxing; just as you need punching practice. Unless your footwork is right and puts you at the correct distance from your opponent, your punches will not land properly. You also need good footwork to evade your opponent’s punches. Footwork not only teaches you balance but also coordination while working your legs and core, giving you evasion and offensive movements. While practicing footwork, ensure that your body is centered and balanced consistently to help you maintain your fighting stance. You must focus on moving back and forth, left and right and pivoting around without crossing your feet. 
Boxing punches Here are some of the basic boxing punches you will learn initially 

In boxing, there are four basic punches. These are: • The jab • The cross • The hook • The uppercut 

You can consider the jab the most critical punch since it gives you substantial cover, leaving not much space for your opponent’s punch. With the jab, you also have the maximum reach without having to focus your weight on it. In terms of technique, the jab is a direct punch which you throw with your lead hand from your guard position, rotating your fist so that it is horizontal on impact. Your jab usually targets your opponent’s nose area. When the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder comes up to protect your chin, while the rear hand stays next to the face to protect the jaw. Once you connect with your target, your lead hand is withdrawn quickly to come back to the guard position in front of your face. 

Your jab is not a knockout punch. Rather, it is used to judge distances and explore your opponents’ defenses, irritate them and follow it up with the heavier and stronger punches. 

The cross can be a strong straight punch you throw across the body with the rear hand. This targets the front of your opponent’s face. The rear hand shoots from the chin, crossing the body and moving towards the target directly in a straight line. Your rear shoulder is pushed forward with the lead hand pulled back to protect your face and chin. To add to the power, your torso and hips are turned anti-clockwise as the cross is thrown with your weight concentrated on your front foot. By turning the body and moving your weight, your right cross gets even more effective and powerful compared to the jab. After you throw the punch, your hand comes back to the guard position. 

You can use the cross in the following ways: • To counter punch your opponent’s jab • Go for your opponent’s head or counter • To counter a cross aimed at the body • To set up a hook 

Your cross can follow a jab to form the classic one-two combination. When you do pad training, you must be careful about driving through with the punch as this can make it uncomfortable for a smaller pad holder. 

The Hook is thrown with the lead or rear hand and is a semi-circular punch. It aims at the jaw line at the side of the opponent’s head. This punch is thrown by rolling the upright fist from the vertical to horizontal position combining it with a small step and rotating the body in that direction, except the head. Your elbow is in line behind the fist to give your punch the power. 

Your other hand is positioned against your jaw to guard the chin. When you connect the hook, its circular path abruptly ends, and you pull back the punching hand into the guard position. You can also aim for the lower body with a hook, and this is called a body rip to differentiate it from the regular hook aimed at the head. 

The upper cut can be thrown from your left or right hand. It is a punch that rises vertically from the outside of your body to the center in an upward motion, reaching for your opponent’s chin. From the guard position, your torso moves to the right, with your rear hand dropping and knees bent a little. Maintaining this position, you would throw your rear hand upwards in a rising arc towards the part you are aiming for, with your knees pushing vertically and torso and hips shifting to look like the movement of the cross. When the punch connects, the elbow of the punching arm moves back in to the rib. 
Boxing combinations Now that you know the four basic punches in boxing, here’s a quick look at boxing combinations, which are basically combinations of the four punches. You can throw the four punches in rapid succession to form the combinations that will help you master throwing punches effectively as offence or defense moves. The combination drills will make your different boxing workouts more fun. The following combinations can be practiced on the boxing heavy bag: 

• The one two combo - This is the jab and cross combination and perhaps the most commonly used. • The one two three first combo - This combo combines the jab and cross, in the order of a jab, the right cross and a jab. • The one two three second combo - This combines the jab, right cross and left hook, using an effective technique. • The one two three third combo - This uses the uppercut, right cross and left hook where the uppercut connects with the body, while the right cross and left hook aim at the head. 

There are several boxing combinations in degrees of increasing complexity which you will learn after you master the basic punches and their combinations. Your trainer will also familiarize you with footwork and evasive moves that teach you to duck and combine your punches, as you build advanced skills. 
Tips Now that you are armed with all the information you need to get started with your hobby of boxing, here are some workout tips. You can develop a boxer’s body without going through the bruises. For your home boxing workout, grab your jump rope/skipping rope, weighted gloves, a timer, light dumbbells and enough space to do your push ups and crunches and get started. 

Here are the workout tips: 

• How much time you spend on your workouts depends on your commitment. There are workouts that can last fifteen minutes or forty five minutes. You need to adjust the intervals, beginning with thirty seconds, building it up to sixty seconds as you improve your strength agility and wind. Preferably, opt for a full body workout, switching between legs and arms. Pretend you are a real boxer when you do your workouts to get a real understanding of what that three minute round is all about, inside the boxing ring. 

• Ensure that you practice with weighted gloves, starting with smooth controlled punches, in the order of 6 to an imaginary opponent’s body and six to his head, alternating both for thirty seconds. You can add other punches and combinations you learn later. Your focus now is to keep your feet and gloves moving. Imitate all the movements boxers make, punch, retract, guard your face and chin and pretend to avoid counterpunches. 

• Practice with your skipping rope rapidly for thirty seconds. Begin with your feet together, elbows inwards, tight and bounce close to the ground. Gradually increase this to half a minute and then one minute. 

• Practice pushups for thirty seconds with your body straight from your shoulders to your ankles, lowering yourself till your upper arms are closer to the floor than your elbows. 

• Do abdominal crunches with feet on the floor and hands behind your head, shoulders off the ground, lower and repeat. Follow this up with a powerful variation where the upper body is flat, raising your knees up, lowering them and repeating. 

• Now it is time for weights. Do this every third day. Begin with five pound weights for biceps curls for thirty seconds, followed by military presses for thirty seconds. Combine these two for thirty seconds. Repeat these for four minutes. You can increase your weights gradually. You will begin to see results soon. If you are after conditioning, exercise for short durations of speed with sprinting and up hill work. 
Conclusion It is all about the physical work outs, speed, strength and agility, followed by dexterous punches and combinations of punches. Remember, do not pick a fight until you are fully conditioned. You can practice a lot on your own, but make sure you are in touch with a trainer or a boxing gym, at least to avoid making mistakes. Moreover, there’s more fun in your workouts when you do it alongside another amateur or professional boxer. Go for it! Punch that bag good.",
Juggling,"Juggling Information  Introduction Being able to juggle is one of those skills that seems to fascinate millions of people around the world. While most cultures will immediately think of juggling as the art of keeping objects in the air, there are many other forms of juggling. That most common one, however, is called toss juggling. 

Ask around and just about everyone will tell a tale of how they attempted to juggle for the first time in his or her life. It was most likely little more than a comedy routine that didn’t work out the way it was supposed to. In all odds, the person probably dropped more of the objects to the ground than they were able to keep up for more than one toss. 

The most common item that people juggle are balls. They can be tennis balls or smaller objects, such as the size of a hackey sack. And for most people who take up juggling in the beginning, three is usually the magic number. 

If you can juggle three objects in the air at the same time, then you are well on your way to becoming a bona-fide juggler. If you haven’t quite mastered this art of juggling, however, the tricks of the trade are really not all that complicated. It just takes some coordination, timing, and practice. Oh, yes, and a little bit of patience will go a long way toward successfully juggling. 
Learning To Juggle Here’s what beginners need to know to master a basic juggling pattern. First, find three items that are approximately the same size and weight. These could be balls, bean bags, oranges, apples or something else. These are called props in juggling jargon. 

Find a roomy place to practice your new hobby. Much space is needed, especially at first, because you’ll undoubtedly drop your props frequently. But your skills will improve with practice. 

Throw one prop back and forth between both hands at eye level. You’ll soon notice that one of your hands is more adept at tossing and catching. This is your dominant hand. The other is called your subordinate hand. 

Now hold a prop in each hand and practice tossing them back and forth between your subordinate and dominant hands. Just prior to catching the ball in your dominant hand, try tossing the other prop you’re holding back. You may have to alter your stance if you find yourself moving your feet to be able to catch the prop. 

Now hold one prop in your dominant hand and two props in your subordinate hand. Toss one of the props in your subordinate hand to your dominant hand. When you catch the returned prop, toss the remaining prop in your subordinate hand back. Keep practicing and you’ll eventually develop a juggling rhythm. 
Benefits of juggling Juggling is a fun hobby that can even earn you a bit of money if you choose to perform your new-found skills before an audience. But juggling offers other benefits, too. 

Juggling can help keep you physically fit and mentally alert. Juggling improves eye-hand coordination skills. Learning the art of juggling develops cerebral skills that you’ll use while writing, reading, or playing music and sports. 

Juggling also improves your eyes via exercise. Juggling makes your eyes hone in on a “target,” a prop, and smoothly follow that prop. Watching juggling props makes your eye muscles more flexible and enables your eyes to coordinate better. 
Where To Learn And Buy Props The best way to learn juggling is by watching a skilled juggler. Try to find a local juggler who is willing to teach you the art. Park districts sometimes offer juggling classes. Local circuses are another source for learning how to juggle. 

Many towns and cities have juggling clubs that will provide lessons for interested beginners. Juggling clubs can be found online or in materials at local libraries. Beginners can also learn to juggle by reading books on the subject. Many online sites teach juggling basics through animated diagrams or instructional videos. 

You’ll need props to begin your new hobby. Don’t buy juggling props at magic shops. The props sold there are usually of poor quality and are often unsuitable for serious juggling. 

Quality props are sold in juggling stores that are found in many cities. Check out the local phone directories to see if there’s a juggling shop near where you live. Many juggling stores also sell props over the Internet. There are online databases listing juggling stores and their locations. 
Making that First Toss Juggling requires dexterity. That means that if you’re clumsy with objects and have a hard time holding onto things, you are probably going to have significant trouble learning to juggle. Whether or not you have innate and uncanny abilities to grab onto and catch things as they fall, or you can mindlessly toss your house keys around and never let them hit the ground, it’s a good idea to start at the beginning. 

Juggling is an art form that offers people from all walks of life the opportunity to try and to see if they enjoy it and whether or not they will be any good at it. While juggling is not like playing an instrument –meaning, there aren’t nearly as many juggling instructors around the world as there are music teachers, this doesn’t mean that you can’t find one. 

If you know of anybody that teaches the art of juggling, then you can find out from them how much they charge and whether or not that is something you’re willing to do. 

If you prefer to start out on your own, then you might do well to pick up a basic book on juggling. It will show you the steps and the things that you can work on so that you improve your overall balance and dexterity over time. It is possible to improve dexterity with a little practice and some patience. 

First things, first, however. If you’re ready to learn how to juggle right now, then find a soft object, something that will fit in the palm of your hand comfortably, and something that has at least enough weight so that the air doesn’t affect the trajectory or path of the object as you toss it. 

You don’t need two or three of these objects right now. All you need is one. 

First step: toss and catch 

When you have this object, then simply toss it lightly in the air and catch it. Make sure that your eyes follow it up and back down into your palm. It may seem silly to do this, but what you’re doing is training your hands to catch something without having to see it directly into your palm. 

But you just said to watch it. 

Yes, but once you can do this without any issues, then it’s time to look forward, at a point somewhere in the distance. Not too far, mind you. Ideally you should focus on a point somewhere a few feet in front of your face. From here, you will learn to use your peripheral vision. 
Peripheral Vision Jugglers can’t see every single object that is in the air at the same. They have to rely on their peripheral vision which most people take for granted. Athletes in team sports such as soccer and football know a great deal about relying on peripheral vision, as do martial artists. 

Peripheral vision allows a person to see more than what the center of their eyes catch and focus on. It takes getting used to, so this single object toss is a great way to develop that knack for using peripheral vision. 

When you begin to get used to ‘seeing’ the object rise and fall and are able to catch it on a regular basis, then try to put a book or newspaper in front of you, in a position so that you can still see the object you’re tossing. Read the paper or book while tossing. This will really put your peripheral vision skills to the test. 

When you can read –and comprehend and remember what you read- and still successfully toss on object up and down, then begin to move it from one hand to the next. Toss the object back and forth until you are comfortable with relying on your peripheral vision. Then you’re ready to toss two objects in the air. 
Adding the Second Object Everyone wants to jump right in and juggle three or more objects into the air. That’s usually the recipe for failure. After you have the basics down of one toss and still using your peripheral vision, then add a second object. Take an object in each hand and toss it up and down. They should be tossed together to about the same height and caught at about the same time. 

This should take some time to get used to, but once you successfully complete this task, then toss the objects to different heights, so that you have to catch them at different times. 

After this is done successfully, you’re ready to begin juggling. Still with two objects, but this time you will toss one from its hand toward the other hand. With your receiving hand you will ‘pass’ or hand off the other object, which will be tossed into the air just as the first one was at the same moment that you catch the first one. 

All you’re doing here is creating a constant flow of two objects, both in the same direction. When you feel comfortable with that, then try the next two object exercise. 

The one-handed toss 

Take both objects in one hand. Now, toss the first straight up in the air while holding onto the second. When the first object reaches its apex, or its highest point, then toss the second object straight up in the air. The objects should take a slight arc, or oval direction, moving from a point closer to your body at the toss and then slightly farther away from your body for the catch. Your hand should move a few inches forward to catch and then a few inches back to toss. 

This will take a great deal of getting used to, and practice. 

It’s best to try this first with your dominant hand. Once you’re comfortable with that, then work on it with your weaker or less-dominant hand. Once you can successfully accomplish this juggling maneuver, believe it or not, you can juggle four objects at once. 
That Third Object When you add that third object to your juggling routine, you will be holding two in one hand and one in the other to start. With the hand that’s holding two objects, toss one into the air toward your other hand. When that first object is reaching its apex, then toss the second object with that receiving hand toward the first hand. When that one is at its apex, you will again toss the object with your first hand toward the second and thus repeating over and over. 

After the initial toss, no hand will need to have (or should have) two objects at the same time. In fact, there should only be one object in either hand while juggling three objects. 

Congratulations, you’re a juggler. 

Perhaps it would be a good idea to take a walk through history and understand where this entertaining art form came into exist and why it continues to thrill and mesmerize today. 
Various Juggling Props Jugglers ply their craft with numerous items, which are called props. Balls are the most common prop. Other commonly used props are bean bags, clubs and rings. Some people also juggle knives, fire torches, hats, cell phones or fruit. 

Juggling bowling balls or cannon balls is impressive to an audience due to the extreme weight of these props. Some jugglers have even been known to juggle odd or dangerous props, such as chainsaws.  
Bean Bags Balls are juggled with the same technique used for juggling bean bags. Bean bags are an ideal prop for beginning jugglers. The bean bags won’t bounce out of your hand when you try to catch them. Bean bags also won’t roll away should you drop them during practice. 

For dramatic impact, some bean bags are equipped with lights. This can be a single red LED light that glows or a microchip that flashes. These glow-in-the-dark bean bags are typically juggled during night-time street performances or on stage at clubs or raves.  
Rings Juggling rings, comprised of thin plastic, are typically 12 inches across. Rings are a good prop choice for beginning jugglers who have already learned to skillfully juggle balls. 

Rings tend to be lighter and thus are not as tiring to juggle. Due to their smaller cross-section, rings tend to crash into each other less often than balls. Rings can be a good investment for the fledgling juggler because they are reasonably priced and long-lasting. 

But rings also have some drawbacks. Wind can make them unpredictable if you’re juggling them outdoors. And jugglers tend to toss rings almost twice as high as balls. So it’s thus harder to keep your throws within a comfortable catching distance. Mistakes can be painful with juggling rings if you catch them wrong or if you trap your fingers between two rings. But beginners will make fewer and less painful mistakes with continued practice. 

Rings are typically juggled on stage because they are highly visible for the audience. Different colors on each side, or other decorations, can add dramatic impact to this spectacle. 

Some jugglers wield fat rings comprised of hollow plastic. These are about one-half inch thick. These fat rings are softer and thus less painful for beginning jugglers who make mistakes during practice.  
Clubs Juggling clubs resemble bowling pins. Juggling clubs are made from hollow plastic and come in many sizes and types. Many juggling clubs have a wooden dowel in the center to add some weight and strength. Some clubs have padded handles and many clubs have rubber pads on the ends. Juggling clubs can be decorated in many ways to add dramatic impact for performances. 

Painful collisions between your hands and the clubs will often result when you’re first learning to juggle clubs. But practice will lead to fewer mistakes and eventually to no mistakes at all. Learn to catch clubs in the soft part of your hands, rather than the bonier parts. 

Gloves are an option for preventing painful bruises when juggling clubs. Choose a fingerless variety of gloves. Biking gloves can be worn for juggling. Select breathable gloves that are light-weight and without much padding.  
Knives Knives are a dramatic option for jugglers who are street performers. But beginning jugglers should not try to juggle knives. You must at least master juggling clubs in a basic pattern before stepping up to knives. 

The technique for juggling knives mirrors that used for juggling clubs. But knives are a bit heavier, so there are some differences in handling these two different props. 

The specialized knives used for juggling are blunt so that you can catch the blade without inflicting too much damage. Even though juggling knives are blunt, they can still cause damage to the eyes if there’s a mishap. And while juggling knives are blunt, they don’t appear to be blunt. The false appearance of sharpness requires jugglers to overcome a natural psychological barrier when juggling knives. 

Start by throwing and catching one knife. Practice this maneuver with both your dominant and subordinate hands. Then move to practicing with two knives. Begin with a knife in each hand and throw left to right in a high arc. Then move up to juggling three knives. Start with two knives in your stronger throwing hand when juggling three knives. 

Don’t juggle knives near bystanders. Don’t sharpen your juggling knives because that will ruin their balance and increase the risk of injuries. Be sure to periodically tighten the screws on your juggling knives. Don’t polish the handles, but be sure to polish the blades occasionally to keep your juggling knives looking good. 

Choose a grassy or other soft location when practicing juggling knives. This gives the knives a soft spot to land if you mistakenly drop them. The blades will bend slightly when dropped, so be sure to bend them back following practice sessions. 

Store juggling knives in a soft bag that’s padded with sponge or newspapers to cushion and protect the blades.  
Fire Torches Juggling fire torches adds much drama and visual impact drama to a juggler’s performances, especially at night or dusk. But fire torches are definitely not a prop for beginners. 

Fire torches resemble juggling clubs. The bell end holds a flame-proof wick that is screwed into or bolted to a metal sheath. The torch is set alight by dunking the wick into fuel, which then burns without damaging the flame-proof wick. 

Do not use gasoline or petrol to fuel fire torches. Acceptable fuels for fire torches are kerosene, paraffin, fuel used for Coleman portable stoves, ethyl alcohol or ethanol, aviation fuel, charcoal lighter fuel or even extremely strong vodka. 
Tips For Beginning Jugglers Here’re some tips that will help beginning jugglers improve their fledgling skills: • Slow the pace at which you toss props into the air if the props are flying in all directions during practice. This allows you added time to control the direction of your toss. 

• If the prop repeatedly drops from your hand when you’re trying to catch it, do hand exercises with both hands. This will improve your motor skills and enable you to more quickly close your hand around the prop so that you don’t drop it. 

• Practice tossing three props in a similar arc using both your dominant hand and your subordinate hand. 

• Practice throwing props using both your dominant and your subordinate hands. First toss the prop leading with your dominant hand. After mastering that maneuver, switch to tossing the prop leading with your subordinate hand. 

• Practice juggling outdoors to give yourself more room for comfort and the mistakes that beginners inevitably make before becoming more skilled at their new hobby. Choose a site with plenty of space. A location with grass underfoot is ideal. Do not stand facing toward the sun while juggling. 

• Practice tossing the props at various heights. You’ll soon find a height that is most naturally suitable for you. 

• It’s important to learn to throw the props close to you. This means you toss the props up rather than out. Juggle something you like to eat, such as chocolates, grapes or marshmallows, to practice this important maneuver. Pretend that you’re tossing the marshmallow, or whatever treats you’re juggling, toward your mouth. Imagine this treat plopping into your mouth. This tasty trick will help you learn to toss props up instead of tossing them outwards. 

• Novice jugglers show a tendency to walk forward when practicing but this can be easily remedied. To learn to stand still while juggling, practice juggling while standing in front of a wall or a closet door. Practice juggling without hitting the wall or door with the props. This will soon help you learn to throw the props in front of you rather than throwing the props outwards. 
Frequently Asked Questions Can juggling help with other activities? 

Of course. Juggling teaches balance and concentration. It requires a certain level of patience and dedication to master and not everyone will be able to, or want, to follow through to the point where they can juggle successfully. However, those individuals who manage to learn to juggle three or more objects at once will tend to have more acute hand to eye coordination. 

Are there groups or organizations I can join? 

Look around the web or within your own community. Juggling may not be an activity that garners a great deal of media attention, but there are many people who love the art of juggling and some who continue to push the envelope of what can be juggled. 

I have a hard time juggling three objects. How do I move from two to three? 

Juggling three items at the same time is one of the toughest things for any new, aspiring juggler to manage. The larger the object that you’re trying to juggle, the harder it will be. First, determine if you’re juggling something that you can catch easily enough. 

Don’t try to juggling three bowling balls for the first time. Not only is this quite difficult, it can cause significant injury to fingers that could get caught between two balls as you shift them in your hand. 

Golf balls make great objects to begin with, but they can cause damage to household items, if you’re not careful. Moving from two to three objects requires a different motion. First, try to simply toss one ball from one hand and catch it in the other without looking directly at the ball (or object). Using your peripheral vision can help to smooth out any wrinkles in your juggling skills and make you better prepared to successfully juggle three objects. 

How can I get paid to juggle? 

If you are skilled at juggling and believe that you have a routine that’s entertaining and that people would enjoy seeing, then you can contact local promoters to see if they are in need of a new juggling act. If you’ve never performed before, but can get five objects in the air, for example, then you will need to develop an act. 

Standing in front of people and just tossing objects around isn’t enough; you need to be a performer and entertain while you juggle. Some people tell jokes. Others juggle dangerous objects. Still others make a comedy routine out of it. Find your niche, develop of strong routine, and before you know it, people will be calling you to join their show. 
Conclusion Juggling is one of the those timeless traditions and art forms that have appealed to adults and children alike. We see a person skillfully juggling and a apart of us simply wants to try it, to see if we could do it. People who can successfully juggle four, five, or even ten objects have polished their skills with many hours, and even years, of dedication and practice. However, the basic concept whether you’re tackling three, four, or more objects, is the same. 

Peripheral vision is a key to successful juggling and when you can master your use of your peripheral vision, you can master the age-old art of juggling.",
Snakes,"Snakes Information  Introduction Throughout North America, it has become quite common to find people that keep different snake species as pets. Twenty years ago, it was only the stereotypical “biker dude with a snake wrapped around his neck” that was known to keep snakes, but the hobby has grown so immensely over the past two decades that people of all ages and sexes are now keeping these wonderful animals as pets. The biggest question that is asked to people that keep snakes as pets is “why?”. Of course the purpose of this article is to answer that very question, but the short and painless answer, or Coles notes version, is that they are the easiest pet to take care of and possibly the most unique of all of herpetology, the study of reptiles. 

But if they are so easy to take care of, why is it that their popularity is now just becoming mainstream? The answer is that there has always been, and perhaps always will be, a negative stigma associated with snakes of all species. Most major religions see the snake as being the devil incarnate, like Christianity, or see them as being dark powerful entities, like in Voodoo cultures, and the evilness of snakes is constantly perpetrated by worldwide myths that show the snake to often be a trickster. The fact is that people associated all snakes with snakes involved in negative incidents, like large constrictors eating small other family pets, extremely venomous snakes killing humans, or even aggressive species attacking humans in the wild, but the stigma associated with snakes couldn’t be farther from the truth. The snakes commonly found in pet stores or available to the public from breeders are less likely to bite than most small animals like hamsters and mice. And for those who have strong allergies to pets, snakes are considered hypoallergenic because they have no hair or dander that most people suffer allergic attacks too. The fact is that snakes make fantastic pets, and once you have one, you will definitely be hooked in the hobby for the rest of your life. 
What is a snake? Snakes are elongate, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with many more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. 
Types of Snakes Of the fifteen families of snakes that are currently recognized, comprising 456 genera and over 2,900 species I have the impossible job of breaking down the nearly three thousand species into three nice, neat groups. Well, to be perfectly honest, the task was considerably easier than you would think because there are only so many available to the public through pet stores and private breeders. The two most popular types of snakes that people generally keep as pets are Colubrids and Constrictors. The main differences will be described below, but these snakes generally come from different area in the world, and they have distinct physical differences, which both factors lead to different housing requirements. The third type that I will cover is considerably rarer and is not recommended for beginners under any circumstances. Venomous snakes are available through specific breeders that deal with specific species of venomous snakes. These snakes are often quite colorful to see in person, and like Colubrids and Constrictors, require their own housing requirements. 

Colubrids are by far the most common type of snake available to hobbyists of all levels of experience. These are snakes that are members of the family Colubridae, which is a broad classification of snakes that includes about two thirds of all snake species on earth. Colubrid species are found on every continent, except Antarctica. The most common types of colubrids for hobbyists are cornsnakes, milksnakes, and kingsnakes, which all have a large variety of coloration for hobbyists to choose from and for the most part they are all good natured. Even more fascinating, a large number of these snakes are actually found within North America, and if you are lucky enough, you may be able to see them in the wild. They span from the Canadian Prairies, to the mountain ranges of Canada and the USA, and even the humid areas in the Southern United States. Because of their popularity and ease of care, there are numerous breeders throughout North America that specialize is producing fantastic captive breed snakes of different morphs, or different colorations and patterns, which means that there is no longer any need to take animals from the wild. 

Constrictors refer to snakes that kill their prey by wrapping their bodies around the prey and squeezing so tightly that it is impossible for their prey to breathe. When we speak of constrictors, we are speaking in general terms because the specific types of snakes we are talking about are Pythons and Boas. These snakes are often grouped together because they are generally larger snakes and because of their method of killing their prey. Although they are grouped together, they do have their own physical differences and they also span different locations of the globe. 

Where the boa comes from Mexico, Central and South America, Madagascar and on Reunion Island, the python comes from Africa, Asia, and Australia. It’s interesting that Colubrids make up two thirds of all snakes where pythons and Boas only account for 21 species in total. The other issue surrounding this group of snakes is that because of their larger size, there are several restrictions including bans throughout North America. This is largely due to the fear of the entire species because of a couple bad apples, namely the Burmese Python, which is good natures but huge reaching sizes of up to 20 feet, and the Reticulated Python, which reaches sizes that rival the Burmese but can also show aggression to humans. 

Venomous snakes are snakes that uses modified saliva, snake venom, usually delivered through highly specialized teeth such as hollow fangs, for the purpose of prey immobilization and self-defense. In contrast, non-venomous species either constrict their prey, or simply overpower it with their jaws. Venomous snakes include several families of snakes and do not form a single taxonomic group that accounts for one quarter of snake species throughout the world. This has been interpreted to mean that venom in snakes originated more than once as the result of convergent evolution. Evidence has recently been presented for the Toxicofera hypothesis however; venom was present (in small amounts) in the ancestor of all snakes (as well as several lizard families) as `toxic saliva` and evolved to extremes in those snake families normally classified as venomous by parallel evolution. The Toxicofera hypothesis further implies that `non venomous` snake lineages have either lost the ability to produce venom (but may still have lingering venom pseudogenes), or actually do produce venom in small quantities, likely sufficient to assist in small prey capture, but cause no harm to humans if bitten. For the purposes of this article, the more common snakes bred in captivity are generally vipers because of their bright coloration. The problem with this type of snake is obvious, but it is always worth saying that they are incredibly dangerous and they can cause fatalities to humans. You have to also understand that anti-venom works in most cases, but there is a limited supply that is usually not accessible in certain areas, and different snakes require different anti-venom. So the rarer of snake you have, the more rare it is to get anti-venom.   Interesting fact about snake anti-venom: Anti-venom is made with the help of horses! Horses have a natural tolerance towards snake venom, and when introduced slowly into their systems, their blood builds a natural immunity. The horse’s blood is then taken in order to make snake anti-venom for humans. 
Purchasing Your First Snake The first rule about purchasing your first snake is to buy a species that is interesting to you. Never be persuaded to purchase a snake that you don’t want because you are told it is an easier snake meant for a beginner. If it is a snake that you don’t really want, then it is a snake that you will grow tired of in the future. Regardless of what type of snake it is that you want, you have to ensure you do all the research about the snake prior to purchasing it so that you take proper care of the snake from day one. There is simply no sense in getting a snake that will grow to be 20 feet long if you are living in an apartment. The idea that a reptile will grow to the size of its enclosure is a myth, and the fact is that if they live in an enclosure too small, their growth will be stunted and they will suffer from health issues. 

One of the most debated issues in all of herpetology is whether to purchase from a private breeder or from a pet store. Here is an argument that is based on a few too many bad apples spoiling it for the bunch. Without pet stores, there simply would not be reptiles, snake, and amphibians in captivity as pets because it was various pet stores that sparked the interest in reptiles in the first place. But over the past twenty years, there have been numerous cases of reptiles being sold by people thinking only of profit as their reptiles suffered from neglect. Thankfully, there has been numerous reptile enthusiasts stepping forward to challenge pet stores that simply do not live up to the standards that reptile require, and there have also been numerous pet stores in North America that have been promoting proper reptile care. The downside to purchasing from a pet store is that you will be paying higher prices because the pet store purchases from breeders and then mark up the prices to make a profit. Sometimes you will find unique snakes in pet stores, but for the most time, they are usually the run of the mill whereas, if you purchase from a breeder, you may be able to get a more unique morph that most people have never seen before. 

As a general rule of thumb, always try to purchase the healthiest snake available. This is easily done by purchasing the largest snake in a group that is bright eyes and active. Larger snakes typically mean that they are being well fed and cared for. If a snake is skinning and not active, then it is best to leave it be. Although snakes are nocturnal, it is important that they are alert when uncovered or picked up. One of the most common reasons for buying a small sickly snake from either a breeder or pet store is because you want to save it and nurse it back to health. Although noble your intentions might be, a life time of health issues will not make you love your snake more, and health issues in snakes are incredibly difficult to treat especially if it is a young snake that has yet to build up a resistance to illnesses. A healthy snake can live many years, and if you put in the time that is necessary, you will be rewarded in the long run. 
Required Equipment All snakes regardless of species require three main things to ensure that they not only survive, but thrive in their new home. The first thing that all snakes require is an enclosure that is big enough for them to stretch out it, but also to mimic their natural ecosystem. If a snake primarily stays on the ground, or terrestrial, then it needs a lot of ground space, but if the snake spends most of its time in trees above the ground in the wild then it should have a tall cage with little ground space. Depending on the type of snake, there are numerous types of substrate available for your specific snake ranging from different types of sand to various wood mulches. You just have to remember to always avoid oak and cedar because they have oils that are toxic to most snake species. Most important of all, especially if you want to keep you snakes in the cage, you have to have a tight fitting lid that they can’t push up or squeeze through. The fact of the matter is, if they can escape, they will, and just because you can’t see them trying, they are trying as hard as they can to escape. 

The second thing to remember about snakes is that they are cold blooded, so they require an external heat source to keep their bodies warm. Without a heat range of 75 f to 80 f (For most Species), you snake will be stressed out and will not be able to digest its food properly. A lot of times when a snake refuses to eat, it is because their temperature is simply too low for their metabolism to function properly. This heat can be from an external reptile heat bulb to heat the cage from above, or you can choose to use a heat mat to heat the cage from below. It is important to heat only one half of the cage give the snake a chance to regulate its body temperature by being able to move from one side of the cage to another. As an add on to heating, most reptiles need daylight in one form or another in order to live long healthy lives. To accomplish this, there are numerous fluorescent lights on the market that mimic the natural like of the sun from different areas of the world for specifically desert, tropical, and sub-tropical reptiles. 

The last thing you have to remember is that snakes like to feel secure. They do this by curling up underneath things that they can push up against and feel safe. The easiest way to do this is to purchase reptile hides from a pet store that look like big hollow rocks that your snake can climb under. These are the easiest to use, most effective, and the safest. Some people choose to use real rocks, which are alright, but you have to ensure they cannot be pushed over because they can and will crush a small snake. And again, snakes like to regulate their temperatures, so it is important to have one hiding spot on the cool side of the cage, and a hiding spot on the hot side of the cage. 
Diet All snakes are strictly carnivorous, eating small animals including lizards, other snakes, small mammals, birds, eggs, fish, snails or insects. Because snakes cannot bite or tear their food to pieces, they must swallow prey whole. 

In captivity, the question of feeding is a highly debated topic. While a lot of people want to feed their snakes live prey items, there is a strong movement from private breeders to feed only frozen/thawed prey items. The problem with live prey is that they can bite the snake back, especially larger mice, rats, and gerbils that can cause significant health risks for the snake itself. The other issue with live prey is that some snakes get into a feeding pattern by eating the same thing over and over, and because large prey item are difficult to get, the snake is more likely to refuse to eat frozen/thawed. The benefit to frozen/thawed is that they are safe to feed all snakes, they do not lose any nutritional value, and you can purchase in bulk in order to save you money in the long run. The best part about feeding snake is that they only eat once a week, which means they only poop once a week. So in general, the maintenance is low and the cost of feeding is as low as twenty five cents for a baby snake and perhaps three dollars a week for an adult. It’s a simple fact that there is no animal that is easier and more affordable to feed than a snake. 
Conclusion Although they are one of the most misunderstood pet on the market today, the snake is one of the best, easiest, and most affordable pet you could ever purchase. The moment a snake is in your house, the hobby envelops you in a way you would never expect. I can probably state as a fact that all private breeders at one time or another were just like you or me, and picked up their first pet snake just because of their uniqueness, but the interest quickly turns into a passion. The simple fact that they do not bit, or are generally not aggressive in any way, makes them a fantastic people for people of all ages. Just when you think they have no personality, they will find a way to surprise you and make you rethink the way you look at snakes forever. And there is no time like the present to get into the hobby because due to the large number of breeders throughout North America, the general price of snakes has gone down significantly over the past twenty years. Now you can easily find beautiful snakes of all sorts of colors and patterns to suit your personality, and the best part is that they are all captive bred.",
Gardening,"Gardening Information  Gardening a Growing Hobby If the need to pickup a very environmentally-friendly and ‘green’ hobby has come to mind, then it must be gardening time. Gardening is the practice of growing plants either for ornamental or food. A gardening effort can involve a plot as small as a windowsill or as large as a few acres. Gardening as a hobby can be an effective tool for stress management as well as providing food for the family and beauty as well. Many gardeners who start out usually do so with a smaller scale as in the backyard. Here they feel more comfortable and can make the usual mistakes that most if not all successful gardeners will do from time to time. In the end, gardening is a thrilling hobby and one that can be practiced for a lifetime. 
Gardening Start-up Cost Gardening as a hobby is one of the least expensive ones to start off with of all the outdoor adventures. For starters, one only needs a patch of dirt, some water and a few seeds. Of course this is a very small plot for gardening as a hobby yet it is where most of the master gardeners got their starts. The minimal cost of gardening makes it a perfect selection as a hobby and one that will give years of enjoyment and beneficial grocery items. The initial cost of gardening revolves around seeds or sprouts, or from cuttings of exist in more mature plant. Many novice gardeners create their first gardening effort from scratch and use the seeds or tops of vegetables and fruits as beginning plantings. To understand gardening as a hobby it is important to realize that there are some minimal cost involved yet none that should break the bank. The average cost of a backyard garden for starters would be under $100, easily. The main important factor to recall about gardening as a hobby is that it is labor-intensive and this is where the fun begins. 

As mentioned earlier garden as a hobby is a minimal price and effort and here are the first starter tools that a novice gardener will need. 

• Hand Shovel • Spade • Small Rake • Watering Can • Seeds or Cuttings • Time • Plot of Soil • Compost Pile 

That’s the short list for any beginning gardening hobby and will provide everything that is needed for the novice gardening effort. There are many different types of gardening tools and manuals and all sorts of seeds and cuttings that can be employed. With an entire world of choices for things to grow personal choice will be the only real limitation to gardening as a hobby. Many individuals that start out in gardening end up selecting either one type of plants over another. For example, there are gardeners that strictly grow only ornamental beautiful flowers for their fragrance and beauty. There are others that only grow vegetable gardens and do so for a reduction of the family food budget bill each and every month. In the end, it is up to the individual gardener as to what will be grown in their garden plot. The main factor is that any garden takes some time and patience to grow. 
Compost The practice of composting has been around since the earliest of gardening and presently has seen a return in both usage and exploration. Almost anything that is organic can be returned to the state in which it came.",
Freelance Writing,"Freelance Writing Information  Introduction Freelance writing has been around for many years, and has enjoyed a recent resurgence in popularity as more people have begun use it as a primary or secondary form of income. 

Freelance writers work with clients, or “buyers”, on a contract basis. The client could be a newspaper, magazine, charity, small business, or individual. Freelance writing assignments commonly include informational articles, sales or marketing materials, books, pamphlets, and newsletters. 

The Internet has changed the face of freelance writing. Assignments are widely available, but the field is competitive. Common Internet assignments include blog posts, e-books, newsletters, advertisements, and content articles for web sites. 
History of Freelance Writing In decades past, freelance writers could expect to type out a full article “on spec”, meaning that they were only speculating that the newspaper or magazine they wrote the article for would use it. The article would then sit in an editor’s slush pile for weeks or months before it was given a full read-through. 

If the article was rejected, the writer would have to start the process over again with a different publication. If the article was accepted, the writer would have to wait months or even years before receiving a paycheck for their work. Research was exhaustive (and exhausting), and was done mostly in libraries. Wages varied greatly by publication. Some magazines, such as Good Housekeeping in the 1960’s, paid as much as $5 per word. 

More recently, freelance writers have become hotly sought after due to the explosion of content on the Internet. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor, approximately 10.3 million workers in the US (7.4% of the US workforce) are independent contractors. In the past three years, companies have increased their outsourcing by 22% on the Internet. 

This has had both good and bad effects on the freelance writing industry. Today’s freelancers can expect very few start-up costs, as most marketing can be done online for free. There are numerous Web sites and freelance marketplaces that put workers in touch with potential clients. The freelance community is open and honest about current rates and markets. Research can be swiftly carried out with the help of search engines and online encyclopedias. Best of all, freelance writers can expect to be paid for their services on a monthly or weekly basis via PayPal or direct deposit. 

But today’s freelance industry isn’t without its hardships. The global marketplace has driven wages down. While freelancers could expect to be paid more than $500 for a 500 word article in the past, today’s writers are offered anywhere from $5 to $100 for the same word count. The market is extremely competitive, with skilled writers from around the world bidding on projects. Low wages and stiff competition scare away many would-be freelance writers. 
The Benefits of Freelance Writing While a freelancer’s workload can fluctuate from month to month, boredom is seldom an issue. There is always something to do, even if the freelancer does not have an active project. Marketing, promotion, bidding and networking are crucial parts of a successful freelance career. Researching new markets, polishing up the portfolio, and creating new streams of income are also important. 

While this is a lot of responsibility to take on, many freelancers love the freedom of not being chained to a desk for 8 hours a day. Their work is often portable, allowing them to work from home, from a comfortable niche in a coffee shop, or even while traveling. 

Compared to starting up a traditional small business, starting a freelance business is very low cost. A freelancer’s greatest commodity is their writing skill. This skill can be displayed online for no start-up cost at all. Free blog software will give you everything you need to put together a professional-looking site to market your services. Free e-mail services and freelance marketplaces let you get and stay in touch with potential clients. 

Many freelancers save money on traditional work-related expenses like fuel costs, work clothes, and child care. They are more freely accessible to their family and friends, and no longer have to deal with the stress of a daily job commute. 

For better or for worse, when you freelance for a living, you are your own boss. Of course, you complete projects for paying clients, but you decide how you will spend your time. You manage your own workload and client interactions. Whether you succeed or fail, you have only yourself to thank. 
The Drawbacks of Freelance Writing The biggest drawback of freelance is the lack of an steady income / work. Also the lack of company benefits can be a big drawback to certain people. The importance of diversification cannot be overstated. In the current economy, newspapers and print publications are going out of business at an alarming rate. Many Web sites have followed suit. You do not want to put yourself in a situation where you depend on one single site or publication for all of your income. What if it goes bankrupt? 

Instead, submit your work to many different publications. Web writers should bid for projects at a number of freelance job sites, and monetize their own blogs and web sites to create new streams of income. 

It is important to note that being a freelancer is not suitable to all people. Being a freelancer requires discipline and self-motivation along with other easier to acquire skills. If the freelancer works at home they are prone to additional stresses, that if not managed properly, could prevent them from earning an income at their profession. 

Your clients need to know that you value their time and money, and that you will provide professional-grade work with a professional attitude. One sad fact of freelance writing, especially on the Internet, is that writers are a dime a dozen. Even very good writers must go above and beyond expectations in order to stand out from the crowd. 

If you feel that you are deficient in time-management skills, work at improving those skills before you leap into full-time freelance writing. You must be able to be consistently productive, manage your workload, and manage your stress level. Otherwise, your work quality and reputation will suffer, and you will be anxious and miserable more often than not. 

As a freelance writer, you are largely responsible for yourself. You market your services, make bids for projects, finish and submit your work, and request payment. You keep track of your financial records and client database. If scheduling conflicts arise in the middle of a project, you are responsible for telling the client and working out a revised deadline. 

Since most freelance writers operate as sole proprietors, the cost of marketing and supplying their business is usually an out of pocket expense. Some of these costs qualify as tax deductions. Always keep your receipts when you make a purchase or pay for a service that will be used for your freelance writing business. You might also find it beneficial to talk to a tax professional, since self-employed individuals must pay taxes on a different schedule than regular employees. 

Essentially, freelance writing is a good job if you’re comfortable with a certain level of risk, don’t mind doing things yourself, and have enough income or savings to get you through times when work is sparse. If you need a regular and reliable income and benefits, you might consider doing some freelance writing on the side, but keeping your day job until your writing business really takes off. 
Freelance Writing and the Internet The Internet has opened up many freelance opportunities, expanded available markets, and has contributed to service sector growth in many economies. Offshore outsourcing and crowdsourcing are heavily reliant on the Internet to provide economical access to remote workers, and frequently leverage technology to manage workflow to and from the employer. 

Much of the computer freelance work is being outsourced to poorer countries outside the United States and Europe. This has spurred conflict because American and European workers are not receiving the benefits. The compromise has led to student freelancers who now provide a steady source of cheap labor while keeping jobs American and European. 

The global marketplace is much maligned by freelancers who feel that their work is undervalued and underpaid. While it is true that most freelance writers cannot command the same prices they did 20 years ago, the Internet has provided countless job opportunities. It is no longer necessary to pound the pavement and mail articles to editors who may or may not want them. These days, freelance writers have a good idea of what sells and what doesn’t, and they have direct access to millions of paying clients all over the world. 

Changes to the publishing industry since the 1980s have resulted in an increase in copy editing of book and journal manuscripts and proofreading of typeset manuscripts being outsourced to freelance copy editors and proofreaders. The troubled economy has made it unprofitable for publications to keep an in-house staff of editors and proofreaders, so publishers often view freelance outsourcing as a cost-effective alternative. Many freelance writers supplement their income by providing these editing services in addition to writing. 
Using Freelance Marketplaces Freelance marketplaces (or outsourcing marketplaces) are websites that match buyers and sellers of internet-provided services. Buyers and sellers of these services each setup profiles on the marketplace website. Seller profiles provide a description of the range of services offered, sample materials, rates, and details about the provider. Buyer profiles include descriptions and specifications of the work sought. Buyers and sellers are able to rate each other and provide positive and negative references/feedback 

Some freelance marketplaces, like Elance, provide escrow services that hold the buyer’s funds until project completion. This service protects both the buyer and the seller, ensuring that the funds are available and that they are released in a timely manner once the project has been completed according to the buyer’s specifications. If the freelancer does not meet their obligations, the funds are returned to the buyer. 

Freelance marketplaces have their pros and cons. The primary benefit of using a freelance marketplace is that there are often hundreds or even thousands of jobs available. Clients create job listings and list the details of the project, the project deadline, and the characteristics they are looking for in a freelance writer. 

There is a record of all on-site communication between the freelancer and the client. This protects both parties if disputes arise. Also, most freelance marketplaces offer arbitration services when the client and the freelancer cannot resolve a dispute on their own. 

For these services, freelance marketplaces charge modest fees. Some require a monthly subscription, while others keep a percentage of the project price. Some sites do both. 

While writers should be wary of scams that require them to pay for the privilege of working, most freelance writers consider the price of a marketplace subscription to be a cost of doing business. The subscription fee actually saves them time and money because their profiles are listed on highly visible websites with millions of visitors. 

The global nature of freelance marketplaces can be problematic for freelance writers living in the US and the UK. International writers can usually provide their services for lower prices, and some clients will always award their projects to the lowest bidder. This has led to discontent among freelance writers, some of whom feel that the global marketplace is driving down wages. 

Western writers can overcome this hurdle by carving out a niche for themselves. Writers who have specialized knowledge in medical, technical, legal, or other professional fields can command higher prices. Native English speakers are sought after as well. Some writers emphasize the high quality of their work, or their rapid turnaround times, when bidding on projects. A long history of positive buyer feedback can also help a writer win projects for a reasonable price. 

To become successful on a freelance marketplace, it’s important to possess good interpersonal and communication skills. Communication is vitally important to prevent misunderstandings. You should also be aware of your strengths, and emphasize them in your profile and resume. 

You might be nervous the first time you bid on a project, but rest assured that even the most seasoned freelance veterans felt the same when they were starting out. There are some techniques you can use to improve your chances of winning the project. 

First, structure your bid in a way that grabs the buyer’s attention. Keep it concise; most buyers will sort through numerous bids before settling on one. Give them the maximum amount of information in the minimum number of words. 

Start with a friendly introduction. Then briefly explain why you are a good candidate for the project. For example, if the client needs a series of articles about landscaping, and you have personal experience in that area, tell them! If your portfolio includes an article about landscaping or a related topic, attach that article to your bid so that the client can easily decide if your writing style is compatible with their project. 

Finish up with a proposed schedule and a breakdown of your fees. Buyers like to know that you’ve fully read through their project description, and that you’ve put some thought into your bid amount. Invite them to ask questions, and provide additional writing samples if you have them. 

Always be courteous to the client. Just because they choose another freelancer today doesn’t mean they won’t consider you for a future project. They might even refer you to a friend or colleague. It pays to be polite. 

It also pays to do some research before you decide on a bid price. Look at the amounts other writers are charging for similar projects. You might have to bid lower at first until you establish a reputation as a trustworthy and skilled freelancer. Once you have successfully completed a few projects, you can raise your rates. 

Note that freelance marketplaces vary in quality. Sites like Elance and Guru have name recognition for a reason: they have many rules in place to protect buyers and sellers. Other freelance job sites might not provide escrow or arbitration. Always read the fine print (and worker reviews) before you sign up with a freelance marketplace. 
How to Become a Freelance Writer Freelance writing is a competitive field, but there is always room for new talent. After you make the decision to become a freelance writer, the next step is to brush up on your writing skills. You need to have a good command of grammar, spelling, and logical sentence structure. It helps to be able to write in a variety of tones, like conversational, persuasive, humorous, and formal. 

If you will be writing for the Internet, it is important to learn how to write for search engines as well as for a human audience. This type of writing is called “search engine optimization”, and incorporates keywords and phrases that will help search engines find and index the pages you’ve written. 

Experienced Internet writers have learned to use keywords and phrases in a way that looks natural to human eyes. Their words flow smoothly to capture the reader’s attention, and their choice of words attracts the attention of search engines. This is a valuable skill for Web writers. Mastering it will make you much more marketable to clients. 

Web writing differs from print writing in another important way: paragraph length. While readers might not mind reading a long paragraph in a book, they tend to better digest information on the Web when it is presented in smaller blocks of text. 

Fortunately, there are plenty of print and online tutorials which can help you get the hang of writing for the Web. Look them up at your local library, or do an Internet search for “writing for the web” or “writing for the Internet”. Read all you can, and then write some practice articles using the techniques you learned from the tutorials. 

After you’ve sharpened your skills (or developed new ones from scratch), it’s time to create a portfolio. A portfolio is a collection of written pieces that you can show to potential clients. The pieces should represent your very best work, and should cover a number of topics. Write 5 to 10 articles, approximately 500 words in length. Carefully check your spelling and grammar. Too many errors will make your work appear amateurish, and may cost you a job. 

Many freelance writers create a personal blog to use as their portfolio. Potential clients can simply visit the blog, read the posts, and decide if they like the blogger’s writing style. If you do not wish to create a blog, you can host your portfolio online through various freelance job sites. If you intend to submit your work to print publications, you’ll need to keep a hard copy of your articles to show around. 

Next, you’ll need to find work. This is often the most challenging step for new freelance writers, but it will become the most rewarding step as soon as you land a paying project. Newcomers usually find writing assignments through online publishing portals, freelance job sites, and print or online advertisements. 

Publishing portals are places where anyone can write articles about any topic, and make money through upfront and/or residual payments for those articles. Some of the best-known publishing portals are Associated Content, Demand Studios, and Suite 101. While the payments are typically quite small, sometimes just a few dollars per article, these sites have high search engine placement and can serve as highly visible platforms to host your portfolio. 

Online personals like Craig’s List are another source for freelance writing assignments. These sites give writers the opportunity to advertise their services for free, and many clients look through the listings to find a skilled service provider. Clients also post their projects on these sites. 

The primary drawback of sites like Craig’s List is the prevalence of scams. Unscrupulous people ask writers to demonstrate their skills by proofreading several pages, or by creating a writing sample specific to the project. Inexperienced writers often fall for these tricks, not realizing that the work they are submitting is the actual project, and not a test. The scammer, having received the project for free, never contacts the writer again. 

Never submit work unless you have a signed agreement from the client that outlines the scope and deadline of the project, what you are expected to provide, and the date and amount of payment for the completed work. If a client asks you to create a writing sample, move on to someone else. Honest clients won’t mind looking at previously-written samples of your work, especially if the samples were written about topics related to the prospective project. These rules apply whether you’re responding to an online ad or a printed one. 

Magazines are another source of work for freelancers. Most magazines list their article submission guidelines somewhere in the publication or on the magazine’s official web site. Do some research to come up with a dozen or so magazines featuring topics of interest to you. If you have expertise with animal training, write and submit a piece to a magazine for animal enthusiasts. If you are a fitness buff, write and submit an article to a health and fitness publication. There are print publications for every niche and genre, so don’t get discouraged if your first submission doesn’t pan out. Persistence is the key.

Wakeboarding,"Wakeboarding Information  Introduction A wakeboard skier works on many of the same principles as a water skier. They are both pulled behind a boat or conveyance. The speed needed will roughly be 18 to 24 miles per hour. And both require more than one person to even attempt the sport. 

There are a few differences between the two sports. A wakeboard consists of a single board and boot. The water skier on the other hand uses two skis. The wake boarder will also perform much more dynamic tricks which is typical of board based sports. 

The trick based mentality has a lot to do with the origins of the wakeboard. Many of the early pioneers of the sport were already proficient with stunts found in sports like snowboarding. This gave wakeboarding a strong influence to follow similar lines. 
Basics When beginning a sport there are several basics that are taught first. These basics not only get you started, but they often prove to be fundamentally necessary in the more advanced stages of the sport. The following are some of the most essential components to wakeboarding.  
Starting position On the back of a ski boat is a ski platform. This portion of the boat is designed to help skiers prepare themselves for getting into the water. 

Start by placing the board on the platform. The boots should be already attached to the board. Your boots should be equally spaced so that if you switch from the left to the right or vice versa in the water, you won’t be thrown off balance. 

Now step into the boots and make sure your boots are laced securely. A secure boot will prevent accidents and injuries. They also give great support so you don’t strain unnecessarily. 

Once the boot is on, sit back into the water while holding the tow handle. The tow handle should be horizontal and held up over the board. While holding the handle make sure that both your palms are facing down. 

Your knees should be completely bent so that you are rolled up like a ball. Your arms should go up and around your knees. Do not put your arms between your knees. Also it’s good not to have a severe bend in your arms. Once you’re in this position you’re ready for the boat to start.  
Getting Up on the Water When the boat starts, the momentum of the boat will help you roll your board under you. While this is happening you need to twist your body around the rib cage and face the boat sideways. Learning to stand up may take a bit of practice. 

Once up you now need to get into a proper wakeboarding stance. This involves your knees to be bent. Your knees should be over your toes while your hips should be over your heels. 

The top half of your body should be facing the boat. Your rib cage and not your hips should be twisted to accomplish this. The handle should be located around your lead hip. 

As for your arms, the back should go straight across your body. The lead arm should be bent enough to accommodate the back arm. These are the proper positions for maintaining yourself on the surface of the water.  
Learning to Edge Edging is the term used in wakeboarding to indicate the left and right motions you make behind the boat. It’s called edging because you traveling to one of two edges on the board. 

Since you are standing sideway on the board, two names are given to this maneuver based on how you are standing. The two directions are toe side and heel side. In this way, you can still have a clear reference even if you switch which way the board is facing. 

In order to move behind the boat, you’ll need to practice how you hold your body. For example to go heel side, you must act as if you are sitting down over your heels. This will pull you backwards allowing you to move in that direction. To go in the opposite direction you must lean over your toes. 

It is recommended tat you practice this for some time going between toe and heel directions. Remember, when you’re learning this stay between the wakes of the boat. If you are unprepared for it a wake can massively disrupt your balance. 

Once you feel you have enough practice with transitioning between these two directions, you can then attempt to go pass the wake. This comes in handy when the boat needs to turn. Every time this happens, the inside wake area loses forward momentum rapidly. Traveling past the outside wake will enable you to maintain that forward speed. 

When facing a wake make sure your knees are bent sufficiently. Whatever you do, do not use the handle to compensate for your balance. Your knees will act as shock absorbers enabling you to move through the roughest part of the wake. All this can be accomplished by utilizing the techniques for basic movement. 

Once you’re through a wake do not straighten or transition immediately. Instead continue in the direction your going until you are about ten feet beyond the wake. This will allow you to recover your balance sufficiently before returning inside the wake. 

The return process is much like the exiting process. All the strain and turbulence should be handled in your bent knees. Once you’re back in the wake you can transition to a neutral position or reverse directions. 

If you find you are having trouble controlling your board, it may be due to your body being out of balance. While moving your board should be on a flat plain with the water. In other words, you shouldn’t be leaning towards or away from the boat.  
Basic Turns When wakeboarding, it sometimes helps to change positions. This will prevent one side from getting cramped or strained. The two most basic turns are the switch and the 180 surface turn. 

The switch involves changing which foot is leading. The board will remain facing in the same direction. The majority of the turn should come from your rib cage region when turning. Make sure after this maneuver is done to regain a proper balanced stance. 

The more difficult trick is the 180. This involves rotating the board from front to back. This move does require some hip movement. 

For starters, place some of your weight on your heels. This will prevent the board from rolling and landing you in a face plant. 

The next step is to begin shifting your hips. This will initiate the turn. When shifting your upper body make sure the turn comes from the rib cage area. This maneuver will change your hip position and look cool in the process. 

There are still a wide variety of tricks that an instructor can help you learn. These were just a sample of what beginners can expect. Jumps, spins, and riding a wake, are more advanced examples that would be taught in later lessons. 
What you need The mandatory personnel involve the boarder and the driver. It is also recommended to have a spotter for better communication between the boarder and the driver. 

A life jacket is a key component to any water sport that takes place in deep water at high speeds. The jacket should be properly fitted and floats your body high in the water. 

A third piece of equipment is the wake boarders tow line. This line differs from a traditional water skiing tow line. A traditional water skiing tow line is made to stretch. If it didn’t there would be a lot more whipping type jerks on the line. In wakeboarding the tension in the line is crucial. So make sure you have a line specifically designed for wake boarding. 

Due to the high degree of stunts that are involved in wakeboarding, it’s recommended to have a professional instruct you. This sport is more intense than other water sports. 

A boat is another key element of wakeboarding. Some boats have been specially designed for the wake boarder. These boats will be discussed in greater detail in a later section. 

The wakeboard itself is the most unique piece of equipment needed. Even though wakeboards serve the same purpose, to let you glide on the surface of the water, they have a number of styles and designs. Many of these designs help the wake boarder accomplish certain things. For example some will allow faster movement while others aid in higher jumps. The specifics of boards will also be covered in a later section. 

Finally there is the boot. Just like a shoe, your boot should be customized to fit your foot snuggly and securely. This is what connects you to your board. A loose fitting boot will lead to injury and accidents. 

As with any sport, make sure that all your equipment is in good working condition. Your instructor will be able to guide you on tings to look for on this point. They will also be able to advise you on how to tell when a piece of equipment looks to need replacing. 
Conclusion This sport has caught the attention of younger generations. Because of its more flamboyant style older fans will probably have difficulty or cause injury because their body can’t hand it. 

This sport does require a great deal of balance and flexibility. For those who find the sport too difficult because of these factors, it is recommended to start with a less impact sport and then transition into wakeboarding. A good candidate for this is water skiing. 

Another limiting factor may be accessibility to water. This sport requires a decent amount of space. This involves staying away from boats and docks as well as swimmers. Much of this can be handled by the boat’s driver, but the space you need may still be hard to find. 

Wakeboarding can be done in lakes, rivers, and oceans. If you want a more competitive venue you may have to travel some distance to find where the professionals train and teach. This can be a thrilling sport and a good way to stay in shape.",
Cycling,"Cycling Information  Introduction To Cycling Cycling can be enjoyed by almost everyone, regardless of your age or your physical ability. You might enjoy a heart pumping downhill ride on a narrow dirt track. On the other hand, you may prefer to explore the open road. Either way, cycling offers entertainment, exercise, and an excellent way to just get around town. 

Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of a bicycle for transport, recreation, or sport. Not only is cycling highly efficient, cycling is generally low cost and no matter how you cycle, you will be exercising while you save money. In addition to the cost savings, cycling as a whole is easy to pick up. From learning to ride your bicycle to finding the equipment you need, this sport has a dedicated store in even the most average of cities. 
Racing and Competitions If you are considering bike racing and you are new to cycling, then you need to know where to begin. Here are some tips to help get you on the road: 

• In order to compete in bike racing successfully, you need to be in good shape. Most competitions require that riders be able to stay on their bike for as long as two or three hours of riding. If you really love to ride and have spent a great deal of time training, then chances are you are ready to take your bike riding to a competitive level. • Group rides are a great way to train for bike competitions. Your options for group rides include club rides, pick-up rides and shop-hosted rides, many offering rider groups of various levels. A beginner group with a leader to help with skills is a great way to get into group riding. If you join a club, you will enter the races under the club name, benefiting from options to buy team clothing. Pick-up rides are less structured, with some open to everyone and participation in others is by invitation only. • Having an experienced racer as a mentor is incredibly helpful for anyone interested in the sport. With someone taking you under his or her wing and showing you all the ropes, you will benefit from an amazing learning curve. • Watching the professionals is a fantastic way to familiarize yourself with bike racing. You can watch bike races such as the Tour de France on the Internet or on television. Following along with the commentators will help you learn racing tactics and skills. • Reading about bike racing is another great way to familiarize yourself with racing. VeloNews is an excellent bike racing resource, as is Thomas Prehn’s Racing Tactics for Cyclists. • USA Cycling is a non-profit organization that supports an Olympic movement for cycling in the United States. Through their website, you can find locals bike teams and clubs. You can also find information on race officials, mechanics and coaches. • As you prepare to become a racer, one thing that you must consider is the type of race you want to try. Many people prefer a circuit race, a road race or a time trial. According to where you live, your only option for a local race may be a criterium, which requires advanced skills and involves some bumping and close quarters. • Another thing that you need to know about bike racing is that the racers are divided into different racing categories. If you are new to bike racing, you will most likely begin with Citizen’s Races, which are divided by gender and sometime by age as well. These are events held for non-licensed racers. There are a number of categories in bike racing from Seniors and Couples racers to Cat I, which are the fastest and most experienced racers. • In order to become a successful bike racer, you must always be eager to improve. However, although you may want to train and train and train, it is just as important to take some time off to rest. Consider reducing your training every fourth week or so to allow your body time to recover. • Getting started in a new sport like bike racing may seem a little over whelming. All great racers had to start somewhere. Simple choose a race and go give it your best shot. Once the race is over, you will be able to work on improving fitness and nutrition, enhancing your skills and honing your race tactics. 
Bicycle Touring Here are some tips that you may find helpful if you decide to take up bike touring: 

• In order to save weight, carry a small bottle of concentrated dish detergent that you can use for all your soap needs, including washing your hair, hands, dishes, clothes etc. • If you need to clean yourself during a bike tour, you can effectively wash off completely, including your hair using just an outdoor fountain, sink, bike bottle or stream. If you have money to spare, a campground or hotel may be more up your alley. • To stand you bike upright if you do not have a kickstand just place the bike against the curb with your rear wheel touching the curb. Turn the front wheel a little inward, touching the curb. Lean your bike slightly away from the street and rotate the crank backward until the pedal flattens against the curb. If you bike is carrying a heavy load, use caution not to put too much weight on your pedal. • Adjusting your cycling cap to keep the flow of air out of your eyes will prevent insects from hitting your eyes and protect you from the headlights of cars when your ride at night. In addition, it will also keep the sunlight out of your eyes when you ride in the daytime. • When you go around downhill bends, apply your brakes lightly. This is similar to the effect you get when you gear down a car. You will be able to turn faster because some traction is maintained going around the bend. If you need to make an emergency stop, you will be able to brake faster. • Carry a toothpick in your bike tire repair kit. You can use it to make the hole so you do not lose sight of your leak. In addition, the toothpick works great to puncture the glue tube. • A handlebar bag works great for carrying small items that you need to access quickly. 
Surviving Long Bike Rides So, you like to ride your bike all the time, going maybe two to five miles a few times a week. Why not go for a longer ride? 

In order to train for a long bike ride, you need a way to keep up with your riding, such as a simple cyclometer. You should be able to find one at a reasonable price. Before your bike ride, map your route with a car, noting landmarks every two and a half and every five miles, then just every five miles for the first twenty-five miles. These landmarks should be places where you can stop for water or a small snack. You should not stop at a landmark for more than ten minutes, nor should you make stops in between your landmarks. Begin with a thorough inspection of your bike, making sure that it is properly adjusted and ready to go. Then put your helmet on and head out to your first two and a half-mile landmark. Once you get there, think about how you are feeling. Are you ready to keep going to the next landmark, or do you need to turn back? 

Every five days of your training period, increase your distance. Within a month, you should be able to reach a goal of around fifty miles or so. 

If you travel at beginner’s speed, then you will be riding at a speed of somewhere around eight to ten miles per hour. Therefore, a fifty-mile ride should take you about five or six hours to complete. 

Riders with more experience and multispeed bicycles may be to do a fifty-mile ride in under three hours. In fact, some seasoned riders can do a hundred mile ride in just over four hours. However, rides at this great of a distance should not be attempted unless have an interest in becoming a professional cyclist. 
History of Bicycles The history of both bicycles and cycling are both lengthy. However, we do know that with every new innovation, cycling grows in popularity. Throughout the 1800s, as cycling became more simple, more streamlined, and more affordable, the innovations came more quickly. The popularity of the bicycle with consumers drove innovation sky high. As a result, we have the modern bicycles we use today. 

Bicycle racing itself has a long history. However, the popularity of cycling events is less so now than ever before. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there were races held all over the world. Today, there are still many opportunities for racing but the crowds are smaller and the racing venues are disappearing rapidly. Events like the Tour de France draw international media and swarms of spectators. There are still several excellent classic races held across the country including the 51 year old Fitchburg Longsjo Classic and the 50 year old Nevada City Bicycle Classic. 
Cycling Benefits The list of health benefits associated with cycling is almost infinite. Cycling produces documented results in increased flexibility, stamina, strength, and concentration. You might just choose to cycle for the purpose of sightseeing or entertainment. The physical benefits that accompany your recreation are good enough to justify cycling daily. Overall, the health benefits associated with cycling make the argument for city support of cycling and the expansion of bike trails all the more powerful. 
Cycling Injuries With every sport, there comes the risk of injury. There are many injuries associated with cycling. Many of these injuries can be easily avoided by following safety precautions and maintaining a constant level of awareness. However, even expert cyclists make mistakes. Common injuries include road rash, bruising, cuts, scrapes, and bug bites. These injuries will heal. 

There are some cycling injuries that will not heal by themselves. These injuries can be prevented if proper cycling techniques are employed and the cyclist does not train too hard, too quickly. 
Where To Start: Choosing Your Equipment Almost all of the equipment you need to begin your cycling hobby can be purchased from one store. You may find big box stores, like EMS and North Face, that sell bicycles in your area. You can also look for small cycling shops in your area. The staff in these stores are highly trained. Not only can they help you outfit yourself for cycling, they can point you in the right direction of trails and resources in your area. 

Before you purchase a bicycle, think about the type of cycling you plan to do. Pick and choose from the myriad of options to find the combination of features that best suits you and your cycling goals. 

You might be tempted to buy everything available for your bicycle. In the beginning, you may not need a bicycle computer, GPS, and heavy winter gear. As your experience and skill level improve, you can add items to your gear collection.
The Bicycle If you plan on a combination of road and mountain biking, pick a hybrid. Road bikes are for the road and mountain bikes are for off-road use. 

The most important part of bicycle shopping is finding the right frame size. A frame that is too small will place unnecessary strain on your joints. A frame that is too large will decrease the level of control you have over your bike. If the frame is not properly fitted to your body, your center of gravity will be greatly compromised. 

When choosing your bicycle, pick the best combination of features for the type of cycling you plan to do. For example, don`t put off-road tires on a road bike.  
The Shoes Many road bikes along with mountain bikes include clipless pedals to which special shoes attach, via a cleat, permitting the rider to pull on the pedals as well as push. 

The right cycling shoes will support your foot on the pedal. This can reduce cramping and foot fatigue as you ride. The shoe you pick will depend on the type of pedal you plan to use with your bicycle.  
The Helmet Helmets offer essential protection while cycling. Modern designs are sleek and lightweight. There is no longer a question of style when choosing to wear a helmet. Helmets are proven to save lives and prevent life altering injuries from having their full effect. A good helmet will cost you at least US$50 and the best helmets can cost hundreds of dollars.
The Clothes Dress for the weather. Lightweight, breathable fabrics are excellent for keeping the body cool and dry in warm weather. Moisture-wicking, heat retaining fabrics like fleece are best for winter riding. Gloves, glasses, socks, and extra outer layers are important regardless of season. 

In general, fabrics suited for most outdoor sports will be appropriate for cycling. However, avoid loose fitting clothing as these clothes may get caught in your spokes, chain, or handlebars. 
Important Cycling Skills As you begin cycling, take your time. Until you are familiar with what your body is capable of, avoid bicycle overuse. Try short, easy rides to start. Gradually increase your distance and difficulty to develop your strength, stamina, and ability without causing injuries. 

Before You Ride Learn to adjust your bicycle to fit your body. You can adjust the saddle, the handlebars, and the location of the brake levers. 

Gauge your fitness level prior to beginning a new sport. If you have been largely inactive for several years, you may wish to begin your training indoors and progress to outdoor cycling as your fitness level increases.  
Basic Skills Braking Pay attention to your surroundings and prepare to stop if necessary. On flat surfaces, use your front brakes more. When braking on a downhill slope, use your back brakes more. On steep hills, use your back brakes to prevent flying forward. 

Changing Gears Again, preparation is key when changing gears. Try to switch to the gear you plan to use before you need it. When shifting, remember to keep pedaling to allow the chain to move to the correct gear. 

Pedal Properly Pedaling isn`t just pushing your pedals around and around. There is technique to proper pedaling. Instead of pushing down right away, push forward a little. Lower your heel as the pedal drops and pick it up again as the pedal nears the bottom of the turn. Pull the pedal back with your toes and then relax. Practicing efficient pedaling will reduce stress on your muscles and improve your cycling ability. Turn Corners Try to center yourself in the trail or road to take the straightest path possible around the corner. Once you are in the corner, stop pedaling. Keep your outside foot low and your inside foot high to stop your feet or your pedal from hitting anything. Straighten your bike and accelerate out of the corner. 
Safety and Legal Requirements The first rule of cycling is to pay attention. Road surfaces are irregular and an unexpected change could cause you to have an accident. Wet surfaces are slippery and dark areas reduce your ability to see hazards. 

If you are out of practice, take a cycling class or practice in a safe area until you are ready to ride in public. These classes are available through bicycle shops, cycling clubs, bicycle cooperatives and even some local emergency services. 

Always wear a helmet. You might think you look silly wearing a helmet, but your brain looks a lot less silly when inside your skull. If you are planning to ride with children, fire departments across the country provide thousands of children with free helmets every year. 

Traffic safety is also important. Pay attention, don`t make sudden moves, and always let pedestrians and motor vehicles know which direction you are planning to pedal. Maintaining control over your bike is essential in traffic. Always be prepared to brake and never assume that a vehicle is aware of your presence. 

Cycling is an exciting and challenging sport. You can make this sport as easy or as challenging as you desire. Across the United States and the world, there are trails that guide the beginner through gentle scenery and others that prove a little tricky for event the most expert rider. There is virtually no room for boredom as cycling offers endless challenges for every experience level.",
Conga - Bongo,"Conga - Bongo Information  Introduction Whether you have an interest in collecting or playing the conga, or the bongos, these rhythmic instruments are essential to some of the most influential music throughout the world. Considered tribal by some or spiritual by others, the bongos and the conga are an instrument that people from all walks of life can enjoy playing, listening to, or simply appreciating from an aesthetic standpoint. 

These percussive instruments are used in a variety of applications and have, for many years, been prominently featured in a variety of musical styles, from blues to jazz to rock and roll. The versatility is what makes the conga and the bongos such an interesting instrument. 

Rarely does one find an instrument that is capable of being played –and made to sound at least fairly decent to a layman’s ears- by a relative beginner, but the conga and bongos appeal to so many people for this very reason. Just sitting down (or standing up next to the conga), one can begin tapping away at the skin covering of the drum. Moving the hand around to different locations will produce different and unique sounds, from lower tones in the middle to higher tones at the edge. 

There are different techniques used to play the bongos and the conga, but the hands are the tool of choice for most professional players. Using open palms and partly closed fingers, as well as the side of the thumb will generate a host of percussive sounds that complement just about any musical style quite nicely. 

Conga and bongos are popular among college students as they add some texture to the lifestyle of living in dorms, and can be a centerpiece for parties. A social gathering conversation, so to speak. 

For those individuals who don’t have any musical talents whatsoever and can’t keep a beat no matter how hard they try, conga and the bongos can become an artistic statement within the home. Conga can be placed directly on the ground, though this isn’t recommended, as an end table style of décor or be used on a stand. Since the conga and bongos are made from various forms of wood, they can be designed in any color and can even be painted in portraits, landscapes, abstract images, and more. 

When you step into the world of the conga or the bongos (or both), you step into a wonderful world of music that connects people at a visceral level. The sound produced from conga and bongos reaches deep into the psyche and the soul and resonates there. There are few musical instruments that can truly be shared by just about everyone at any time and that makes the conga and bongos extremely unique. 
The Conga The conga, also know as a tumbadora, is a tall, narrow, single-headed Cuban drum with African precursor. Most congas / stand approximately 75 cm from the bottom of the shell to the head.
Playing techniques There are five basic strokes: 

• Open tone (or abierto): played with the four fingers near the rim of the head, making a clear resonant tone with a distinct pitch. • Muffled tone (or tapado): like the open tone, is made by striking the drum with four fingers, but keeping the fingers against the head to muffle the tone • Bass tone (or bajo de palma): played with the full palm on the head. It makes a low muted sound. • Slap (or seco): the most difficult technique makes a loud clear ""popping"" sound • Touch (or toque de punta): is produced by just touching the fingers or heel of the palm to the drum head. 
The Bongo Bongo or bongos are a Cuban percussion instrument with a pair of single-headed, open-ended drums attached to each other.
Playing technique Bongo drums produce relatively high-pitched sounds compared to conga drums, and should be held between the knees with the larger drum on the right when right-handed. 
Getting Started: What Comes First? If your interest in the conga or the bongos is to be able to play them, then there are some questions to ask yourself first. Do you wish to excel at this instrument? Do you have any previous musical experience? Or are you simply planning to dabble in it for a while and see what happens? 

Perhaps you’re a member of a performing group or band and want to add the element of the bongos or the conga to your routine, especially on a few songs. For the purposes of this How To article, it will be assumed that you are a musical novice and are looking to learn how to play the conga, or the bongos. 

You can certainly sign up for musical lessons and, depending on where you live, you may find some professional musicians who have experience enough with the instruments to be able to teach them. Most percussion musicians, from jazz musicians to orchestra percussion performers, have had at least some experience with the conga or the bongos. 

Music lessons can be quite expensive, especially for those individuals who have some significant musical experience, training, and education. This might not be reasonable, or even feasible to spend up to a hundred dollars or more per half hour lesson to learn the conga or the bongos. The best bet is to discover whether you have a hidden passion for music and more importantly, for the conga and/or the bongos. 

While you don’t need to have the instrument to begin learning, you can certainly use substitute objects in order to get the feel. As far as learning the techniques, there are many wonderful teaching methods available across the Internet. Videos and images are one way to learn the art of playing the conga or the bongos without requiring you to take lessons. 

If money is an issue, then conga is probably not the route to take in the beginning, as they are generally far more expensive than bongos. Conga can cost up to and even more than $1,000 US while a cheap set of bongos can cost well under $100 US. There are, of course, many used instruments for sale around the country, but it would be advisable to determine your true level of interest in the instrument before going out and spending a significant sum of money on one. 
What You Need: If Not the Instrument It may sound strange that you don’t really need a pair of conga or bongos in order to begin learning. This is unlike most other instruments that you will find throughout the world and that is one of the features that makes it so appealing to so many people. 

If you don’t have access to bongos or a conga and don’t have the money to spend right now on a set, then you can use a number of different items in its place. The most popular happens to be plastic buckets turned upside down. A bucket without a lip on the underside is ideal, though if you use one with a lip, or a ridge, then you will want to be careful not to injure your fingers on it by hitting too hard. 

Other items that people have commonly used as substitutes for bongos include pots and pans, especially large sauce pots and sauce pans, and even books. The idea isn’t necessarily the sound, but the rhythm of using your hands to create percussive sounds. 

Look around your house and you will likely find a number of items that are ideal for using as a substitute for bongos or the conga. All you really need to get started with the learning to play the bongos or the conga is a surface to hit against. 
Tips and Tricks Learning any musical instrument requires time, patience, and practice. It also requires a little thing called dedication. For those individuals who have no musical abilities or inclination, who can’t tap their foot to the rhythm of a song, it doesn’t mean that your musical life, or journey has come to an end. 

Rhythm can be taught and learned. There are simple strategies that you can use to help you develop rhythm and slowly ease into being able to keep tempo with music on the stereo and then eventually with other musicians. 

Use a metronome 

One of the most important facets to learning and improving in music is by the use of the metronome. Traditional metronomes use a pendulum swinging action to create a click. The tempo can be adjusted to fit any pace or style of play. Modern metronomes are often digital and can produce any type of sound, from simple digital clicks to beeps to instrument sounds, such as a snare drum. 

You can find inexpensive metronomes used or new at just about any musical instrument store. When you first start using your metronome, simply tap your foot or your hand (or both) to the rhythm of the beeps, or clicks. Every time the metronome clicks, you should tap your foot or hand. 

Start out slow and then work up through the different tempos. In time, you will be able to do this without thinking about it. When you feel comfortable, stop the metronome and attempt to keep a tempo on your own. This separation from the assistance of the metronome may require some practice. 

When you can keep time with your foot or hand without a metronome, then listen to your favorite music and follow along with the beat of those songs. Again, this may take some time and getting used to, so be patient. You may have to go back and forth with the metronome and the music until you ‘lock in’ to it. 

In time, anyone can manage this and become musically and tempo-rally adept. 

Take the conga or the bongos and play along with your favorite songs 

Once you have acquired some decent rhythm, then it’s time for you to play along to your favorite music. You do not need to own a set of conga or bongos to get used to playing with the music, as any of the aforementioned items will work nicely for this purpose. 

The idea here is to engage in real time performance. 

When you are able to do this, and the desire is still there, if you don’t already own bongos or conga, then it’s time to head out and find some. 
Buying the Right Conga or Bongos There will be many different brands and styles of conga and bongos to choose from. When it comes to bongos, it doesn’t have to be aesthetically pleasing because they can be stored out of sight if you have company coming over. However, conga, due to their size, should be something that is almost considered a piece of furniture that you will display in your home. 

You don’t want to have to stuff the conga in the closet when you have guests over, so pay attention to the appearance. Some used conga may have considerable wear on them and these may not be the right conga for you at this time. It pays sometimes to spend a little extra and get the right set for you and your home. Unless, of course, you plan on taking your act on the road.

Origami,"Origami Information  Definition and History Origami (ori meaning ""folding"" and kami being a translation of ""paper"") is a traditional Japanese folk art of paper folding. Its was created in the 17th century and has evolved into the modern art it is today. It consists of transforming a flat sheet of material (that is typically paper) into a sculpture. 
Technique The only material needed for origami is paper. It should be thin, able to hold a crease, and not tear easily when folded a number of times. Some origami paper is colored on one side, with white on the other. Paper should always be folded on a hard, flat surface, and the folds should be as straight and precise as possible, with all corners and edges meeting evenly. The standard folds are categorized into the following: - Valley Fold – The paper is folded downward, or toward you. When unfolding the paper, the crease should always be on the bottom, resembling a valley. 

- Mountain Fold – In this case, the paper is folded backwards, or away from you. When the paper is unfolded, the crease will be on the top, causing the paper to look like a mountain. 

- Crease – This is the line that remains as a result of a fold. 

- Top – The corner or edge of the paper that is pointed away from your body is considered to be the top. 

- Bottom – This is the corner or edge of the paper that is pointed toward your body. 

- Front – This is the side of the paper that is facing you as you work. 

- Back – The side of the paper that is facing the table is considered to be the back. 

- Right – The parts that are lying to the right of the middle of the line. 

- Outside – This is the back and the front of your work. 

- Inside – This is everything that is between the front and the back layers of paper. 

- Unfold – This is the process of opening up a previous fold. 

- Turning – This is when the paper is turned (while still flat on the table) so that the corners are aligned. 

- Turning the Model Over – The paper is turned over so that the front becomes the back. 

- Outside Reverse Fold – The front and back layers of paper are spread apart and wrapped around the outside of the model, causing the edges that were originally valley folds to become mountain folds. 

- Inside Reverse Fold – An edge that is a mountain fold is pushed down between the front and back layers of the paper. By doing this, the edge has become a valley fold.",
Snowboarding,"Snowboarding Information  Intro Snowboarding is an exciting winter sport and the best part is, you can be quite proficient in snowboarding in under a week! Most people who take up snowboarding as a sport and hobby cant help getting hooked to it and the best part of it is – you can choose how to enjoy it. You can either speed down the slopes for that high adrenalin rush, or just enjoy a leisurely ride to relax you! 

You probably heard about snowboarding through a friend or read about it – and the fact is that it can be a lot of fun. It is rare to find someone who has tried snowboarding and didn’t like it. Snowboarding has its origins in the US around the 1960’s. It has come a long way since then, in terms of equipment and styles. You will hear of two basic styles of snowboarding – and these are freestyle or free ride and alpine or carving and you’ll need different kinds of equipment for each. There are plenty of snowboarding competitions held each year and as many as eight million people enjoy snowboarding in the US. Since 1998, it is also an Olympics event. 
Equipment you need to get started Snowboarding is a hobby like no other, and you must actually experience it to enjoy it fully. So let us take a look at the gear you will need to get started. 

Obviously, you will need a board. You get three different kinds of boards and you can choose the one that suits your style of snowboarding. These are: 

• Free ride board, which is the most popular and ideal for all mountain, park and half pipe snowboarding. With this, you can have a great time carving, catching air and a variety of other riding aspects. These free ride boards are directional, so you can ride them in one direction. You can identify this by the difference in the tip from the tail, where the tail is narrow, short and flat compared to the board’s tip. You can also ride fakie on it. 

• Freestyle boards are wider and more stable compared to free ride boards. These are also shorter and lighter, making them easier to handle for the beginner. These are fine for performing tricks on the terrain parks and half pipes. 

• Race boards or alpine boards are carving snowboards that are narrower than other snowboards. They are meant for higher speeds and fast carved turns so that you can move really fast on hard snow while being stable. These are available as symmetrical and asymmetrical versions. These boards are also unidirectional. 

You will also come across split boards that are a combination of skiing and snowboarding. It looks just like a snowboard, but it is designed to split when you are moving, like skis. There is a connection between the two skis when you ride. 

Snowboard boots and bindings come next. You will use your boots and bindings to control your snowboard so you need to choose a good pair that will protect your feet and ankles as you whoosh around at high speed, carving turns, in addition to keeping your feet warm in the cold weather. Bindings help to fix your feet to the snowboard securely. Buy your bindings after you get your boots so that you get the perfect fit. You will also need to learn how to adjust your bindings. 

Helmets are an essential snowboarding equipment to keep your head safe if you happen to fall. When you snowboard off-piste on uneven rocky terrain helmets can save your life. So ensure that you get a helmet that fits well. 

You will need suitable snowboarding clothing. It is better to dress in layers when you go snowboarding. There are padded waterproof snowboard jackets and pants specially designed for this sport. These are made of breathable material since you will sweat. There are a number of stores where you can get the necessary gear to protect yourself particularly if you choose freestyle snowboarding. You will also need wrist guards and kneepads to prevent wrist injuries. Goggles can help protect you from snow blindness. Padded clothing guards your body parts like hips, knees, back, shoulders, etc. that are likely to take the impact when you go snowboarding. You will need good ski socks and warm waterproof gloves or mittens. 

One good option is to hire your snowboarding kit at snowboarding centers, so you might probably like to try that the first week before you invest in your own. Later it is not mandatory that you buy a brand new one. There are many rental shops that will sell stuff at amazing discounts, so if you keep track of this, you can get a great bargain. You might like to go along with a friend who knows about these things so that you don’t end up being taken for the wrong kind of ride. 

You can also consider packing food or snacks and a flask of hot coffee, as these can be pretty expensive if you go to a ski resort. 

Once you are equipped, you will be raring to set off on that exhilarating ride. The first thing you must decide on is your stance. The common stances are ‘goofy’ and ‘regular’. If you have your left foot forward, then this is the regular stance. The right foot forward is ‘goofy’ so you might want to find out which one is your style. 
Basic snowboarding styles You are likely to hit the slopes on your first day out. How do you plan to learn? You have the option of going in for professional instruction, and this is the best way to go since you will learn the basics properly. Some people prefer to learn from their friends who are experts at snowboarding. 

Your snowboarding will start with safety policies. Make sure that you always follow all the safety guidelines related to snowboarding meticulously as it can save your life. 

Initially you will learn stretching, how to fall and then move on to snowboarding with one foot. This is very useful as you progress to turning skills and getting off the board. You will also learn the specific lingo associated with snowboarding like side stepping, lift, linking turns, edge control, carving, off piste riding, racing, etc. 

Popular snowboarding styles include 

• Free riding or all mountain snowboarding which is good for beginners 

• Freestyle includes the tricks, jumps, rail slides, half pipes and switch riding 

• Free carving is about speed and the extreme carving turns and for advanced snowboarders 

• Split boarding that is just like skiing and snowboarding combined.

Beer Tasting,"Beer Tasting Information  Intro Beer tasting has become a very popular hobby. Similar to those who love wine, the beer enthusiast will learn, over time and tasting what to expect from different types of beer before it even goes into his mouth. In addition, beer tasters develop a palate that can distinguish subtle flavors and nuances between different beers – even of the same style. 

Beer tasting is not difficult to learn, and certainly need not be intimidating. In past years, finding beer tastings was somewhat difficult, but they are much more plentiful today. Even many wine shops are adding beer tastings to go along with their wine events. 

So, if you’re interested in getting started as a beer taster and enthusiast, this guide will hopefully give you some help. You’ll learn the different types of beer, as well as the proper etiquette of tasting beer and what to look for when you taste. You’ll even learn how to host a beer tasting in your own home. So………let’s drink up! 
The Different Styles of Beer There are primarily four styles of beer: ale, lager, lambic and hybrid. 
How to Taste Beer So, now you may be a little bit overwhelmed by the many different styles of beer, but this is where the fun begins. You’re going to a beer tasting. You have an idea of the characteristics of each type of beer you might taste. Here’s how to handle the actual tasting itself. 

First, there’s the pouring. At a “real” beer tasting, the beer will be poured for you. But, nonetheless, you need to know how to pour a beer correctly.  
Pouring The beer should run gently down the inside of the glass as you pour. Judge the speed of your pour by the head that is forming. You should have a head of about the width of two fingers when you’re finished pouring. Some beers contain visible yeast at the bottom of the bottle that is meant to be drunk with the beer. If this is the case, stop the pour with a bit of beer left in the bottle. Swirl the remaining liquid to lift the yeast sediment and pour it into your glass.  
Appearance Before you begin drinking, look at the beer. Note whether the head is dense or thin. Heads are sometimes described as rocky if they are especially dense with dips and peaks forming as some of the bubbles pop. The color of the head is also worth noting and can range from pure white on Pilsners to light or medium brown on some stouts and porters. 

Next, look at the beer itself. Is it cloudy or clear? What color is it? Try to judge in your head if it looks true to its style, based on the information you have about the style of beer you’re trying.  
Aroma A beer will typically either smell hoppy or malty. Lighter colored beers usually have a hoppy smell while darker beers usually smell more like malt. But dark beers often have a roasted, chocolate or coffee aroma, too. You should give a beer at least three sniffs before you taste.  
First Sip It’s important to note your first impression when tasting beer. There will be an initial sensation as the beer touches your tongue. Is it bitter? Sweet?  
Mouthfeel Feel the beer’s texture in your mouth. It might be silky, thick or thin. It may feel fizzy or flat.  
Strength Strength refers, of course, to the amount of alcohol in the beer. It is either measured specifically by the gravity of the beer or by determining the actual percentage of alcohol by volume. When you’re tasting, you are just getting a “feel” for whether it is a very strong beer.  
Finish As you hold the beer in your mouth and then swallow, you will note slightly different flavors, and you’ll note the flavor that lingers in your mouth after you swallow. Your mouth may have a bitter taste, or a malty sweetness. 

If you’re taking notes, write down all your impressions. If you really liked the beer, make a note of it for purchasing later. Compare your notes to the typical characteristics of the style of beer you tried, and see how it compares. Take a second sip of the beer to see if your second impression is the same as your first.  
Other tips on tasting Do not taste new beers with food until at least the second taste. The flavor affects your impression. Cleanse your palate with water between beers. Though many people have crackers or cheese between beers, even these can affect your impression. 

If you taste several beers, taste them in order of color, lightest to darkest, just like wine. 
Developing Your Palate as a Beer Taster Now it’s time to start developing a palate, and learning to detect the subtle differences from beer to beer. As a beginner, it’s likely that all pale ales, for example, taste exactly the same. Here are some ways to improve your palate. 1. Taste only one kind of beer for a night. All pale ales taste the same? Taste two or three, one after the other, with no other kind of beer for that session. Go back and forth between them, making sure to cleanse your palate in between. 2. Don’t smoke. Smokers have a much less discriminating palate for beer (and wine and food) than non-smokers. The smoking dulls your palate. Cut back on the salt, too. It also dulls your palate. 3. Eat varied foods. This sounds crazy, but it really helps. When you’re describing the taste of the beer, you’re going to need to describe it as reminding you of something. The more varied your diet, the more words in your descriptive vocabulary. For example, that oatmeal stout tastes like chocolate. But is it dark chocolate or milk chocolate? 4. Try all the styles. Don’t limit your tasting to pilsner or pale ale. Try them all. The more you try beer, the more you’ll pick up subtle differences. 
Host Your Own Beer Tasting A great way to spread your enthusiasm about your new hobby is to host a beer tasting in your home. It’s fun, and seems a lot more grown up than just having the guys over for a few cold ones, doesn’t it? 

Hosting a beer tasting is really pretty easy, especially now that you know exactly how to taste beer properly.
First, pick your beers If you’ve been tasting for a while, you may already know some beers that you’re ready to share with your friends. Or, you may want to taste new ones yourself. Either way is fine. You might also consider having a tasting theme, such as doing all German beers or Octoberfest Beers in the fall, or all wheat beers for a summertime tasting. 

You’ll need six to twelve beers at your tasting. Allow three ounces per person per taste. Of course, get extras for people to drink when the official tasting part is over. The best part of a tasting, after all, is having a full bottle of your favorite (or two).
Choose Your Guests Four to six guests is a good number for a beer tasting. Any more than six and it can get crowded at the tasting table, and some people will get bored if you aren’t moving on to the next pour fast enough.  
Set Up Your Tasting Spot You’ll need the following for your beer tasting • A table • A beer glass and water glass for each participant • A pitcher of water • A swill bucket • Pen and Paper for each participant – it’s helpful if you go ahead and list the beers you’ll be tasting on the sheet, in order, with room after each beer’s name for the taster’s notes. You might also list where you bought the beer and its price, in case your guests want to go and buy some for themselves.
Serving Food It’s a good idea to serve some food at your beer tasting. It will help soak up some of the alcohol, and it just makes for a better party. Try having one appetizer per beer or per two beers, with each appetizer being chosen for the fact that it pairs well with those one or two beers. 

In general, cheese, bread, fruits and deli meats all pair well with beer. But, if you can find a couple of food items that specifically complement at least one of the beers you’re tasting; so much the better.
Here’s How it Works • Each participant starts with a clean glass. You’ll pour about three ounces of beer into the glass. At this point, if you have compiled tasting notes on the beer; give your guests an overview. Remember to start the tasting with your lightest beer and work up to the darkest. • Allow them to sniff, taste, discuss and taste again. You always swallow beer at a tasting because you can’t taste the hop bitterness until the beer reaches the back of your tongue for swallowing. So, you won’t pass the swill bucket just yet. • Guests will want to take a sip or two of water from their water glasses before going on to the next beer. And, they may want to use some water from the pitcher to rinse their beer glasses, too. This is what the swill bucket is for. • If you’d like, pass the appetizer that you’ve chosen to go with a particular beer between their first and second tastes of it. They should get a clear impression of the taste of the beer alone before they taste it with food. • Have fun! A beer tasting isn’t designed to be a stuffy affair. It’s designed to be fun and educational. As long as you and your guests have a good time and drink some good beer, the tasting is a success. 
Resources When it comes to beer tasting, nothing takes the place of experience. However, there are plenty of good resources on beer that you should have at your fingertips. Here are some suggestions. 1. Have a good beer store. You’re not going to be able to get much variety by shopping for beer at the grocery. (Though it will likely have better prices on the beers it does carry.) You need to find a local store that carries a wide variety of beers and that gets in new varieties regularly. It may very well be that your best resource for beer is your local wine shop. Many wine shops have jumped on the beer bandwagon and offer tastings and selections of both. 2. Read. You need a few good beer books on hand to help increase your knowledge. Here are some good ones. • Tasting Beer: An Insider’s Guide to the World’s Greatest Drink by Randy Mosher • The Beer Lover’s Rating Guide- by Bob Klein – This is a great portable rating guide you can use to help you choose good beers. • The Beer Taster’s Log: A World Guide to More Than 6000 Beers – by James Robertson – This guide lists beers from all over the world. 3. Use the Internet. There are tons of great beer resources on the internet. Some of the best beer websites include: • Beertutor - A list of beers and their ratings and reviews • Malted Barley Appreciation Society Home Page – One of the best places for beer news. • Foam on the Range- Beer news, information and fun. • Rate Beer- An beer rating site. This site rates beers from all over the world. • Beer Hunter – Michael Jackson’s (the beer expert) web site. Lots of great information from one of the world’s foremost authorities on beer. Jackson has passed on, but his site lives on authored by other beer experts, but still retaining much of Jackson’s wisdom. 4. Get a Phone App – It might sound crazy, but having a beer app on your phone is a great way to help you buy properly, record tasting notes and increase knowledge. • For the Iphone, try Beer Match, which helps you pair beer and food and IBeers Pro, which lists and rates 2700 varieties of beers. • For the Android, try Beer Cloud Mobile, which helps you track down particular beers in your area stores and which helps you pair beer with food, and Beer Journal, which lets you record and edit breweries, as well as take notes on the beers you taste. 5. Join a beer club or get on a beer panel. Many specialty beer and wine stores offer beer clubs or tasting panels. With a beer club membership, you get one or two new beers each month to try, and often a discount on further purchases for that month. It’s a great way to expand your palate, as the beers are professionally chosen. Beer panels are simply tasting committees for beer shops that help them choose which new beers to add to their stock. 
Conclusion Beer tasting is such a fun hobby, and it’s gaining popularity every year. The drink that was once the “poor man’s wine” has fast become the trendiest drink around. And, with so many new beers arriving each year; it’s easy to see why.",
Birdwatching,"Birdwatching Information  Introduction If you are looking for a hobby that will get you outdoors, is environmentally friendly, and doesn’t take a big investment in instruction or equipment to get started, then bird watching may be for you. You can even start in your own backyard or local parks, and you don’t need to be super fit or do a lot of research and training to get started. Best of all, bird watching is one of the fastest growing hobbies, so it’s a great way to meet new friends. 
Where and when to bird watch Most birdwatchers will keep an eye on birds around them at all times but will make specific trips to observe birds fulltime. The most active times of the year for birding in temperate zones are during the spring or fall migrations when the greatest variety of birds may be seen. On these occasions, large numbers of birds travel north or south to wintering or nesting locations. Early mornings are typically better as the birds are more active and vocal making them easier to spot. 

Certain locations such as the local patch of forest, wetland and coast may be favored according to the location and season. Seawatching is a type of bird watching where observers based at a coastal watch point, such as a headland, watch birds flying over the sea. This is one form of pelagic birding, by which pelagic bird species are viewed. Another way birders view pelagic species is from seagoing vessels. 

Weather plays an important role in the occurrence of rare birds. In Britain, suitable wind conditions may lead to drift migration, and an influx of birds from the east. In North America, birds caught in the tail-end of a hurricane may be blown inland. 

And, of course, you can follow other bird watchers, or try to find out where birds have recently been seen. This is much easier to do today than in the past, where by the time news got around of an interesting sighting, the birds had often moved on. In the early 1950s the only way of communicating new bird sighting was through the postal system and it was generally too late for the recipients to act on the information. In 1953 James Ferguson-Lees began broadcasting rare bird news on the radio in Eric Simms` Countryside program but this did not catch on. In the 1960s people began using the telephone and some people became hubs for communication. In the 1970s some cafes, like the one in Cley, Norfolk run by Nancy Gull became centers for meeting and communication. This was replaced by telephone hotline services like ""Birdline"" and ""Bird Information Service"". 

With the advent of the World-Wide Web, birders have been using the internet to convey information; this can be via mailing lists, forums, bulletin-boards, web-based databases and other media. While most birding lists are geographic in scope, there are special-interest lists that cater to bird-identification, `twitchers`, seabirds and raptor enthusiasts to name but a few. Messages can range from the serious to trivial, notifying others of rarities, questioning the taxonomy or identification of a species, discussing field guides and other resources, asking for advice and guidance, or organizing groups to help save habitats. Occasional postings are mentioned in academic journals and therefore can be a valuable resource for professional and amateur birders alike. One of the oldest, Birdchat (based in the US) has probably got the most subscribers, followed by the English-language fork of Eurobirdnet, Birding-Aus from Australia, SABirdnet from South Africa. Orientalbirding, India. 

Several websites allow users to submit lists of birds seen, while others collate and produce seasonal statistics, distribution maps. 
Equipment To get started, the best investment you can make is a good pair of binoculars specifically designed for bird watching. Most specialty outdoor, hunting, or wild bird equipment suppliers will be able to help. Expect to pay around $100 for a good entry-level pair of bird watching binoculars. As you become more experienced, and develop specific areas of interest, or if you want to compete or photograph your birds, there’s a wide variety of equipment available to you. What you choose depends on your interests and your budget, but some of the main categories of bird watching supplies are listed below. 

Choose your field guides according to the types of birds you expect to see. A selection of small guides for your specific locations, even seasonal guides, is much more convenient to carry on bird watching expeditions than a large volume covering birds of many areas or even countries. There’s no need to carry a heavy guide full of information about birds you simply aren’t going to find in your area or at that time of year. 
Who can help Prominent national and continental organizations concerned with birding include the British Trust for Ornithology and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the United Kingdom, the National Audubon Society in the United States, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the American Birding Association in North America (USA and Canada). Many state-wide or local Audubon organizations are also quite active in the United States, as are many provincial and local organizations in Canada. BirdLife International is an important global alliance of bird conservation organizations. Many countries and smaller regions (states/provinces) have ""rarities committees"" to check, accept or reject reports of rare birds made by birders.",
DJ,"DJ Information  Intro Djing is a hobby that can smoothly transition into an exciting career if you really have the attitude and skill for it. To a large extent, Djing is to do with attitude, dynamism a love for music and being in touch with it continuously. But first let us understand exactly what a DJ does. To put it very simplistically, DJs or Disc Jockeys choose music and play them back to the audience, so that they can dance to it. But there is more to Djing than this. DJs blend songs through a process of ‘mixing’, which means they must be great at ‘song selection’. 
A DJ’s Basic Skills - Mixing And Song Selection DJs literally blend songs in such a way that they produce seamless music, preserving the energy on the dance flow. It involves a lot of creativity to do this. To be good at mixing, it takes technical skill that you can learn. The mixing is at its best only when the song selection is appropriate. DJs create what is called a mix set when they blend songs. The DJ bears in mind the specific mood of the event, mixing songs that transport the people through highs and lows - and eventually brings them back to earth. Of course, different DJ’s have different personalities and therefore different unique styles. 

We tend to think that Djing is almost always live, but it can also be on radio or recorded, which can be just as intense. In live performances, DJs often interact with the audience, choosing tracks that go with the mood of the moment. The DJ does not choose tracks at random – careful thought goes into selecting the songs particularly since they have to choose from thousands of new releases. 

So let us now look at what kind of DJ you would like to be. 
Kinds of DJs Though there really is no hard and fast rule, we can broadly divide DJs into the event DJs and the club DJs. Event DJs DJ at parties, moving around and have a lightly tougher job since they must tailor the music to please a diverse audience. No matter what kind of DJ, though, you need be aware of and have access to a practically limitless selection of music. One of the best way to get started to check out if Djing is for you is to find someone locally, perhaps a friend, so that you can practice on their equipment, before you decide to buy your own. Equipment for a DJ can cost a bit so we recommend that you first invest in CDs and records. 
Basic Equipment You Would Need To Get Started There are four must-haves when you are Djing, apart from music, of course. Most well known pubs and clubs already provide the equipment you need. But where this is not the case, you need an amplifier and speakers. There are speakers with built in amplifiers that eliminate the need for a separate amplifier. Next you’ll need a mixer. A mixer lets you keep the continuity in the music because if there is no mixer, you end up with long pauses between record/CD changes. Mixers let you get on with your beat mixing, scratch mixing, song blending, song swapping and so on, all while maintaining the rhythm. You will also need a source of audio in the form of two variable speed record decks or CD players. Technics is a brand that most DJs swear by because of its quality and dependability. Most DJs mix dance music by altering the speed to blend the beats. 

So you could say that a very basic set up for your Djing hobby could set you back $ 500 or so – though the sky is really the limit, depending on what you choose. Cheap equipment could often turn out to be of mediocre quality, so it is a good idea to think before you invest. 

Protect your equipment with a voltage regulating power splitter. 
Sourcing Your Music You will need to establish contact with a reliable record store that has up to date music in vinyl format, as this is the preferred form for DJs. Listen to the music before you buy it. Keep in touch with the latest in music – radio stations, buzz charts, magazines and so on. You can also buy music online. There are websites that let you listen to samples before you order. 
Djing Techniques DJs have a host of techniques that let them switch from one record to another without pause. One of these is beat mixing, where you slow down or speed up a record to match the beat of the next one. This is a very common technique. Scratch mixing is another technique by which the DJ pushes or pulls the record, where you hear that scratching sound. If you have heard DJs who play Rap, RnB and Hip Hop, you will be familiar with this technique. Another way to transition from one record to another is pitch mixing, also referred to as key or tone mixing. Invariably most dance music ends with pure beats without any other background stuff, so it is easy to just let the end blend with the beginning of another record. 

Incidentally, it can be a little tough to match beats with some older kinds of music as in soul or live music, mainly because the beat sounds are produced by the artist and can be a little off-rhythm. When the drumbeats are synchronized with a computer then you get perfect rhythm that makes it easy to match the beat. 
Some Tips Make sure you practice and polish your Djing skills before you actually do it in public. This will build your confidence and ensure that you have a great time entertaining your audience. If you decide to be a ‘mobile DJ, you must look good, as must your equipment. Apart from enhancing your rebooking value and bringing you the right kind of publicity, it makes you look professional. Get to know the kind of event you are going to be Djing at and dress accordingly. Be punctual – it is not fashionable to be late! 

Before you go on a gig, ensure that all your equipment is in working order. Also make sure that there is sufficient power supply. Do a trial run of the kind of music you intend to play. Finally, as with any skill, practice will make you perfect! There is good money in Djing and you really do not have to quit your job or studies as you can do it part time. As you get established, you can develop plenty of contacts through Djing forums. 

Well. That’s it for starters. At Discover A Hobby we have information and tips, instructional videos and excellent books on Djing that cover it in depth. Videos are a boon when you want to watch and learn the tricks and mixing to become that DJ everyone wants to hear! You will also find valuable links that can tell you all that you want to know about Djing. So go ahead and wrap them around your little finger – get those decks rolling and make them dance!",
Tea Drinking,"Tea Drinking Information  Introduction Tea drinking as a ceremonial activity has been in existence in Japan since the 9th century and in China before the 8th century. In these countries the preparation and consumption of tea is an art form, known as the Way of Tea, and highly respected as a ritual of peace and harmony. Other countries including India, Great Britain and parts of the Middle East are also very well known for their love of tea consumption and its role in social events and activities. Tea drinking as a hobby can include learning about the different cultures and how tea is used in those cultures as well as having the chance to try out teas from around the world. 
Tea Basics Tea, at least in traditional form, is a combination of the leaves, internodes and buds of the Camellia sinensis plant. Most tea varieties require a tropical or subtropical climate to grow, however some varieties can grow outside of these conditions. Tea plants have to grow for at least four years and some up to twelve before they are able to produce seeds, however harvesting of the leaves can occur after about the three year mark for most varieties. The slower growing the plant the more flavor is contained in the leaves and those varieties that are slow to mature are the most prized in traditional Asian tea preparation. 

There are several ways that the leaves and other parts of the plant can be prepared to produce a variety of different types of fragrant beverages. There are also herbal teas, which may include non tea plant ingredients that are consumed either in combination with tea or as a drink on their own. 

There are six different types of categories of teas that are made from different types of the Camellia sinensis plant. They include post fermented teas, black tea, oolong, green, yellow and white tea. The strength of the tea and the flavors contained in the beverage once steeped are largely a part of the type of processing combined with the variety of the tea. 

All tea is oxidized by enzymes to create fermentation in the leaves that produces the dark color and the flavors of the tea. Heating is used to stop the fermentation and preserve the tea leaves at the desired fermentation level. Drying is then completed either during or after heating to preserve the leaves and prevent the growth of fungi that will lead to contamination of the tea leaves. 

White tea is the least processed of all teas and is typically only made from the very young leaves of tea plants. These leaves are wilted but not allowed to start the oxidization process before they are dried. This keeps the leaves very mild in flavor and white in coloration. Yellow teas, which are not common outside of Asia are allowed to yellow but are not wilted or oxidized, which means they are dried almost immediately after harvesting. Green teas are also an unwilted an unoxidized type of tea but they can include many different varieties of tea plant. Oolong teas are wilted and bruised to increase the fermentation but they are only allowed to partially oxidize. The black teas, which are most common in western culture, is wilted and bruised or crushed and fully oxidized for a high tannin content and full flavor. Rarely consumed outside of Asia are post-fermented teas which are green teas that have been left to dry in the air for months to up to years after harvesting. This long fermentation period produces rich yet very smooth types of teas that may be stored for up to 50 years without any decrease in flavor and quality. 

Choosing a variety of teas to get started with a tea drinking hobby takes a bit of research and some careful consideration based on the types of teas you enjoy. Try finding an online or local tea shop that will provide information on the specific blends or types of teas that they sell. It is highly recommended that you start with small batches of each tea and gradually increase the amount that you order based on the types of teas you enjoy. Tea, like any type of ingredient, will lose flavor if kept for long periods of time. Smaller packaging with air tight containers in a cool, dark, dry place in the home is the best option for storage. Tea should never be stored in the fridge or freezer as this can dramatically affect the flavor of the tea. It also should not be stored in areas where there is a dramatic temperature change either becoming hot or cold. 

Teas can be consumed with a variety of additives including milk and sugar or honey, which are the most common in western cultures. It is important to note that green, yellow and white teas are rarely if ever consumed with any type of additive. Black teas, which are known as red teas in Asian cultures, may be consumed with small amounts of lemon or citrus, especially those popular in India and Great Britain. Earl Gray Tea and Masala Chia tea may also have bergamot added to the tea to infuse additional flavors. Masala Chia is a popular blend of tea and several spices including pepper, ginger, cloves, cinnamon and cardamom boiled with water, milk and sweetener. 

Generally those that are passionate about tea and tea drinking do not select commercially available tea brands. They tend to avoid teas sold in bags or as instant teas since theses are often the lower quality leaves. High quality loose teas are really not expensive, especially if you purchase online, and just a very small amount of tea is all that is needed to produce an outstandingly fragrant and flavorful beverage. 
Tea Supplies The supplies required to get started with tea drinking as a hobby will vary based on the types of tea you are interested and in the specific ceremony that you may wish to have. There are, in some areas, classes on both the Japanese and Chinese tea ceremonies and there are online videos, books and DVDs that outline the specific steps in an authentic ceremony. In these cultures becoming the host of a tea ceremony can takes years of practice and perfection and it is truly an art form and a living piece of cultural history. 

For those that want to enjoy teas from around the world and provide an opportunity for others to do the same the basic supplies needed for tea drinking are readily available. You will need to have an appropriately sized kettle for heating water. Some people use only distilled or purified water which is recommended over tap water. Tap water may contain chemicals and additives that can cause reactions with the flavors of the tea, or the additives can overpower the delicate notes of the tea flavors. If you live in an area where the tap water has an odor or taste, distilled or purified bottled water is highly recommended to give you the true tea flavor. 

Kettles can be electric or designed to be heated on the stove, either is appropriate for preparing most types of tea. For very traditional tea ceremonies a ceramic or clay tea pot heated over coals is used. Copper, cast iron, enamel and stainless steel are the most common on the stove types of models. Keep in mind that some of these types of kettles do need special care to prevent rusting and discoloration. Water should not be stored in the tea kettle in between use as sediments and deposits from the water can build up over time and add impurities to the boiling water. Water for tea should be heated to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and then cooled to the recommended temperature based on the type of tea you are brewing. Black teas should be brewed at 200 degrees while the more delicate green teas at 180 degrees Fahrenheit. 

A tea pot or a set of tea cups and infusers or strainers are most common for loose tea preparations. The infusers, sometimes known as tea balls, are packed with the loose tea leaves and added to the heated water in the cup to steep. It is important to remember that different teas require different steeping times and the strength of the tea should not be controlled by steeping longer or shorter, it is controlled by the amount of tea added to the ball or infuser. 

Tea pots for loose leaf tea may have strainers in the neck of the pot to prevent the leaves from being poured out with the tea. These are a good option but remember that the remaining tea will continue to steep in the leaves, resulting in a bitter second cup. A better option would be a larger tea ball or straining the tea into a second pot for only a short period of time. Tea is always best when freshly prepared and not allowed to sit for longer than the recommended steeping time. All teas will have various quantities or tea that are recommended for an eight ounce cup of water. For most teas the ratio will be one to two teaspoons of loose tea per eight ounce cup with steeping times from less than 30 seconds to up to 10 minutes. 

Tea cups are really a personal choice. Traditionally tea has been served in fine china cups for special ceremonies, including the British tradition of high tea, in most countries. The cups used in tea ceremonies are very specific in Japanese and Chinese cultures and are small bowels rather than cups as westerners understand the term. Mugs are typically not recommended for tea as they hold the heat into the water and can cause the tea to become stronger over the time it takes to consume the beverage. China cups allow the heat to naturally dissipate and prevent continued steeping in the container. 
Conclusion Tea drinking as a hobby is both healthy as well as delicious. It provides an opportunity to learn about different countries, different cultures and even different traditions. With online tea stores now offering a huge range of pure and blended teas in small sized containers it is also a very low cost hobby to start at any time. 

For more information on tea varieties, tea ceremonies and tea drinking traditions check out the internet, your public library or talk to individuals at your local tea store for ideas on teas to try out. Tea drinking is always a social event, so be sure to invite your friends and family to get involved in the hobby, you just never know what you will discover about your own tastes and what you like.",
Classical,"Classical Information  Intro People often think of the pleasant strains of instrumental music that reach their ears the moment ‘classical music’ is mentioned. The interesting thing is that classical music spans a period of over seven hundred years and has evolved into different styles of music. Of these, the ones most talked about, in the order of their evolution, are the mass, the madrigal, Gregorian chant, chamber music, choral works, the opera and the symphony. These styles developed through different periods in the development of music. 

It is thought that classical music saw its origins in the Middle Ages, developing through the Baroque, Classical, Romantic and Contemporary periods. During these periods, there were wonderful composers who gave the world fugues, sonatas and concerti. This not only established classical music, but also laid the foundation for different genres of music like jazz, pop, rock, etc. 

The classical music composed from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century in Europe, the UK and Russia was influenced by the Upper Classes. In the 16th century, since the church was dominant, it was church music. Around the same time, India saw the emergence of classical music in the courts of emperors. In the 17th century, however, there was a change and the first ever opera was composed in Venice. 

In the 20th century classical music was recognized both in the western and eastern world. Today everyone has access to classical music. Listening to classical music is a great experience. Moreover, there is a wealth of legendary musicians who literally transport you to another world with their compositions. 
How Did Classic Music Evolve? Singing is something that existed for centuries even before classical music was recognized. Here’s a brief look at its history:  
The Middle Ages – Before 1400 During the Middle Ages, a group of monks along with Pope Gregory I got the credit for the first classical music ever heard. These people actually wrote the music, producing the first sheet music. Pope Gregory allotted each singing note a letter: A, B, C, and D, which are used to this day to represent notes. Since then, E, F, G and half notes between these notes have been added. The monks began to write and sing songs based on these notes and this music came to be known as Gregorian chants. They were spiritual and serene. Some years later, a monk whose name was Guido of Arezzo came up with the musical notations do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti. Gregorian chant thus characterizes the medieval age with a religious leaning. Examples are Salve Regina, Gregorian chant sung by the Benedictine Monks of the Abbey St Maurice and Saint Maur, and Frescobaldi’s works.  
The Renaissance Period – 1400 to 1600 Then came the Renaissance Period, which brought the world the madrigals and operas. It was the age when music and art flourished. Madrigals were a type of vocal music formed of three or more voices and sounded very rhythmic. It was called madrigalism. The singers sang, expressing the mood of the song in their voices. The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi added music to madrigals and also invented the opera, which was more dramatic.  
The Baroque Era – 1600 – 1750 In the Baroque era, which was around the late 1600s, the so-called upper class families hired a composer to entertain them. It was during this time that Vivaldi, Bach and Handel existed; creating musical pieces that would be remembered forever. There were also church composers during this time. This period is considered the first of the four prominent periods in the history of classical music. Composers experimented with various styles, transcending beyond the rules of the Church. It was during this time that the piano was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori. Famous works in the Baroque era include Bach’s Well tempered clavier, a set of 24 preludes and fugues and Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons – with each season being a concerto for violin.  
The Classical Period – 1750 to 1820 The Classical period, during the mid 1700 to early 1800 saw some of the best composers in classical music history. Composers like Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Beethoven and Mendelssohn composed concertos, sonatas and symphonies. This period was characterized by more balance structure and harmony to the music. There was more of instrumental music than vocal, as more musical instruments were invented. A new musical form was the classical concerto where the orchestra accompanied a solo instrumentalist. There was also the symphony by Haydn, who composed more than a hundred of them. It was during this period that the sonata was also first composed, which introduced the melody and secondary themes. Mozart’s specialty was the opera and Beethoven’s was piano sonatas and symphonies.  
The Romantic Era - 1820 -1900 Around the mid 1800s, Beethoven ushered in the Romantic era and classical music became emotional and a form of free personal expression. This period saw the emergence of musicians like Berlioz, Chopin, Brahms, Liszt, and Strauss. Before the mid 1800s, Vienna Austria was considered the classical music capital, but subsequently, composers like Dvorak, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff worked from their country of residence, blending the local music into their compositions. Notable compositions of this period are Liszt’s virtuosic piano solo St. Francis of Paul Walking on the Waves and Mendelssohn`s First Violin Concerto.  
Impressionistic Period - early 1900 In this period, classical music evolved to become more visual, with composers like Debussy, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Ravel and Gershwin, who turned their music into visual masterpieces. Ravel’s Bolero centred around dance scenes using a single rhythmic theme. The harmonies and scales were vibrant. 

After the Impressionistic period which lasted for a few years around the 1900s, we now have the present day contemporary music. Although much of the earlier styles formed the basis for contemporary classical music, composers experimented, merging different genres of music. For example take Schoenberg`s 12-tone system. John Cage used nuts, screws etc. to tweak the sounds of piano strings. 

However, legends like Bach, Chopin, Beethoven, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Handel, Liszt, Strauss, Brahms, Debussy, Vivaldi, Stravinsky, and many, many more are still the names that come foremost to the mind while talking about classical music. Let us take a look at the different styles of classical music before we look at the musicians. 
Styles Of Classical Music Classical musicians followed a particular structure or style when they composed their music. Of these, the important ones are: 

• Symphony - A symphony is about an hour long and is made up of four movements. It requires a complete orchestra and is challenging to compose due to its complexity. 

• Sonata - Sonatas are like symphonies but can be played by a lesser number of players. 

• Sonatina - A sonatina is a shorter sonata with fewer movements. 

• Concerto - A concerto involves a solo player backed by an orchestra. 

• Dance – In classical music, dance music included the waltz, which was characterized by a steady rhythm. 

• Serenade – This was mainly background music often played on special occasions like dinner parties and events. Serenades are also an hour long and make for gentle and peaceful listening. 

• Theme and Variation – This is a melody at the beginning of the musical piece. It recurs throughout the song with some variations. For example, Pachelbel’s Canon in D. 

• Rhapsody – These do not have a specific structure and similarity to fantasias, but they have a unique rhythm and tune. 

• Tone Poem – Similar to rhapsodies, tone poems told a story. For example think of the Star Wars score by John Williams. 

• Overture – An overture or prelude is a short piece that evokes an emotion or mood. 

• Ballet – There is classical music set to ballet. Initially this was meant to be background music, but Tchaikovsky changed all that, literally revolutionizing this genre. 

Here are some terms to get familiar with while understanding classical music. These relate to the way the music sounds and is composed. First, a look at the way music sounds: 

• Atonal music sounds dissonant. This relates to music like jazz. 

• Crescendo relates to the gradual increase in the volume of the music being played. As it gets louder in degrees, it reaches a crescendo. The progression is steady. 

• Tempo relates to the music’s speed. For example, The Four Seasons by Vivaldi has different speeds. The conductor of the music normally decides this, although the composer could also specify the tempo. 

• Rubato is a variation in the tempo, where the speed is increased or decreased in one phrase. It later catches up with the tempo. 

• Cadence refers to a pause in the music, when the orchestra stops for a moment to indicate the end of a movement. It barely lasts for a few seconds. 

• Counterpoint is a combination of different melodies to form a harmonious whole and here, each singer picks up from a different point in the song. 

Now take a look at the terminology related to musical composition: 

• A Cadenza is a solo. Some musical movements end with it. As the orchestra ceases to play, the soloist continues to perform for a few minutes. 

• An Exposition is the first movement of the symphony, introducing the main themes. 

• Movements are the different sections in the entire piece and could be dissimilar to each other, yet connected. Some symphonies have four movements. Concertos have three movements. During a performance, there is a pause between movements. 

• Now that we have a good grip on the history, evolution and different aspects of classical music, it is time to look at some of the greatest composers of all time. 
Famous Composers Antonio Vivaldi 

Vivaldi has written over 700 musical pieces. A priest by profession, he later worked as a violin teacher. His specific style was concertos and one of his most famous works is The Four Seasons. 

Johann Sebastian Bach 

Bach’s specialty was playing the piano. He was especially known for his ability to blend different tunes into one song in the counterpoint style. His most famous work is Air on the G String. 

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 

Mozart was a child prodigy and a gifted musician. A musical genius, Mozart loved to compose complex scales and include it in his music. He probably has the largest number of compositions compared to other musicians. Some of his most famous works are The Magic Flute, The marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, etc. 

Ludwig Van Beethoven 

A brilliant composer and pianist, Beethoven was a sensitive musician. Even though he went deaf at the age of 31, Beethoven continued to compose some of the most beautiful classical music known to man. His music was emotional in keeping with his various moods. He has composed symphonies, concertos, overtures, chamber music and operas. In fact, Beethoven is referred to as one of the three Bs of classical music along with Bach and Brahms. 

Frederic Chopin 

Chopin revolutionized the belief that classical music is limited when played on the piano. He composed some wonderful music during his time. Some great examples of his work are Grand Valse Brilliante and the lively Fantaisie-Impromptu Opus 66 in C-sharp Minor. All of Chopin’s music was played on the piano and his music was heavy with romance and passion. 

Peter Tchaikovsky 

Tchaikovsky has the credit for bringing a major change to classical ballet music. His famous compositions, among others, were Nutcracker Suite and 1812 Overture. 

Igor Stravinsky 

Stravinsky’s music was unique and off beat with crescendos. His Rite of Spring is one of his most controversial works, yet one of his most admired. 

Other notable composers in the classical music area are Joseph Haydn, Schubert, Handel, Mendelssohn, Brahms, Liszt, Strauss, Berlioz, Dvorak, Rachmaninoff, Debussy, Gershwin, etc. 

Thus, classical music has been composed and experimented with across a variety of genres for over a thousand years. It has encompassed a range of instruments like the piano, violin and other stringed instruments, allowing music lovers all over the world enjoy concertos, sonatas and operas that shall live forever.",
Taekwondo,"Taekwondo Information  Introduction Over the course of the last fifty-five years, Taekwondo has come a long way from its beginnings in the Korean Army. It wasn’t long ago that Taekwondo was relatively unheard of in North America, perhaps due to the fact that it has yet to be featured in big budget Hollywood films like Kung-fu or Karate, but Taekwondo is now common in most cities across Canada and the United States of America. The reasons for its popularity are many, yet the most common reasons for its success are that it promotes a healthy active lifestyle, it’s accessible to all ages, and it is just exceedingly enjoyable. 

Throughout this article, you will learn the basics of Taekwondo, ranging from its different schools to its multiple features and ending in learning what to look for in a school and instructor. With so much to detail in one article, we must first jump into the past to give you a brief history of the development of one of the most accessible and popular martial arts of the twenty-first century. 
Features of Taekwondo The main feature of Taekwondo that makes it stand out from all other martial arts is its emphasis on kicking techniques, which is significantly different than other popular martial arts like Karate or Kung Fu. The idea behind this is relatively simple as the belief is that the leg is the longest and most powerful weapon a martial artist can wield. Due to its emphasis on kicking techniques, Taekwondo has evolved to the point where specific kicks are designed to overcome certain guards. For instance, the back kick is designed to defend the body and head while delivering a powerful kick backwards driving the heel of the foot into the opponent’s stomach whereas, the axe kick is designed to be lifted over an opponent’s head past their blind spot to be dropped on the top of their head. But, that is not to say that the hand techniques of Taekwondo aren’t just as devastating as their kicking techniques. Just like the kicking techniques, the hand techniques, like punches and knife hand strikes, are developed to strike with enough power and fines to significantly reduce retaliation. 
Rank System The first thing that is required to know about Taekwondo ranks is that Taekwondo as a whole is based in military tradition. As such, the ranking system is similar to military ranking by placing the higher ranks above the lower ranks in such a manner that respect is expected from the bottom up. The first lesson learned in Taekwondo is to respect your senior. In this way, black belts are referred to by last name only, or by sir or madam. At the beginning of each class, all the students bow to the head instructor or in some cases other highly ranked black belts. Even outside of class, it is expected to bow to your instructor and highly ranked black belts regardless of where you are. 

Taekwondo ranks are typically separated into ""junior"" and ""senior,"" or ""student"" and ""instructor,"" sections. The junior section typically consists of ten ranks where junior ranks are usually identified by belts of various colors, depending on the school, so these ranks are sometimes called ""color belts"". The senior section is typically made up of nine ranks. These ranks are called dan , also referred to as ""black belts"" or ""degrees"" (as in ""third dan"" or ""third-degree black belt"").To advance from one rank to the next, students typically complete promotion tests in which they demonstrate their proficiency in the various aspects of the art before a panel of judges or their teacher. In contrast, promotion from one dan to the next can take years. The general rule is that a black belt may advance from one rank to the next only after the number of years equivalent to the current rank. 
Competitions Throughout the world, there are many different schools of Taekwondo, but the two main organizations are known as the World Taekwondo Federations (WTF) and the International Taekwondo federation (ITF). I mention this only because in some instances there may be some slight rule differences, but for the most part, the rules for competition are quite similar. The only time one set of rules gets precedence over another is at the Olympics where the WTF sparring rules apply. 

Just as there are multiple sets of rules for the varying Taekwondo organizations throughout the world, there are also different contests held at each tournament. Typically, the two most common competitions are patterns and sparring, but it is not uncommon to see breaking or power breaking contests at Taekwondo tournaments as well. In Olympic Taekwondo competitions, only sparring is contested.  
Sparring Sparring is a full-contact event that takes place between two competitors in a ring measuring 8-9 (Depends on Organization) meters square. Matches typically consist of a two minute round and gold metal matches consist of two rounds with a minute break between rounds. Being full contact, competitors gains points by striking the opponent with a hand or foot technique. The competitors gain 2 points for a body kick, 3 points for a head kick, 1 point for a body punch and 2 points for a head punch. There are four corner judges that award points based on accurate hits for each competitor, and after the regulation time, a winner is decided based on the scores of the four judges. In the case of a tie, another round, often shorter than regulation, is fought, or in some organizations, sudden death rules apply to quickly decide a victor. 

One of the most common fears of parents and young students is that an injury could occur during sparring matches because of the full contact nature associated with the event. Of course nothing could be farther from the truth. Although competitions are full contact, the use of excessive force is not tolerated at most Taekwondo events. The purpose of sparring is to showcase the competitor’s speed, agility, and technique not to simply hurt one another. When lower ranks initially learn to spar, there is little to no contact until the students learn a greater control of their techniques. As students progress, more contact is allowed until black belt level is reached. At higher levels of competition, well disciplined students learn to take contact and perform counter attacks to score more points.  
Patterns Patterns, or forms, are a staple of nearly every type of martial art across the world. The pattern itself is simple a series of techniques, including hand strikes, kicks, and blocks, that are performed to test the student’s technique. The idea behind patterns is that the student is having an imaginary fight with one or more imaginary opponents. In Taekwondo, patterns begin simplistically at the white belt level and grow into complexity as the student moves through the ranks. Even the highest degree, or dan, or black belt knows specific patters associated with his or her level, but as one progresses through the ranks to black belt, the student is expected to learn new patters yet also retain the old patterns. It is not uncommon for students to be asked to perform additional patterns for tests other than the ones required to achieve the next level. It is also common to hold black belts tests where students are asked to perform all patterns up to their specific level. 

In competition, students are asked to perform either the patter of their choice or the pattern of the judge’s choice, and they are then judged on how well they performed their pattern. In some cases, the student is asked to perform their pattern alone where they are given points as to how well the pattern is performed, but the more common method is to have two students perform their pattern, often different patters altogether, at the same time and once both are done, the judges pick a winner who moves onto the next round to perform again. But what exactly do the judges look for? The most important aspect is perfection. The student must perform the pattern’s movements and techniques exactly as they were taught. A sure sign that the pattern was performed perfectly is that the student will finish on the exact same spot that they started on, which is the same for all patterns in Taekwondo. Other things judges look for are fines, power, flexibility, sine wave, and self confidence. From the second your name is called to perform to the moment you sit down, you are being judged.  
Team Sparring/Patterns One of the most exciting aspects of Taekwondo is the addition of team contests in most Taekwondo associations across the world. These types of competitions are usually held for international or world championships where a team of five men travel to compete as a team. So far, competitions are held without mixed men and women teams because sparring is not broken into ranks or weight categories. It is common to have an assortment of black belt ranks and weights competing against one another regardless of fights being favored to one competitor or another. Generally, the same rules apply as normal sparring, only the first team to win three matches is declared the winners. 

Team patterns are judged in the same manner as individual competitions, but are considered significantly harder because not only do the patterns have to be perfect, but they have to be performed in sync with the rest of the team. If one member is off, the match is over. In the case of team patterns, there is the opportunity for teams to make small changes to make the performance greater in the eyes of the judges. For instance, members can start the pattern at different times, speeds can be altered, and other such changes can be added so long as the pattern’s movements and techniques remain the same.  
Breaking One competition that often draws a large crowd is the breaking or power breaking competitions. The most common competition is the power breaking competition where students compete to break the most 1 inch think boards at one time. So if one person breaks five boards and another only breaks three boards, the competitor with the most broken boards wins. The most common techniques are kicking techniques, like sidekicks or jumping back kicks, which if performed perfectly produce a massive amount of force used to break multiple boards in one strike. 

Other breaking competitions often held are ones to judge distance where competitors use flying kicks to jump over obstacles to break a board on the other side. The winner is the competitor who flies the farthest while still breaking the board. The other variant of this completion are flying high kicks where competitors jump as high as they can in order to break a board, and like the flying kicks, the person who breaks a board at the greatest height is considered the winner. 
Equipment The first thing every new student to Taekwondo needs is a uniform to wear to class that is often worn through all ranks including black belt. One can simply find these easily on the internet, but it is nearly 100% of the time sold to the student by the Taekwondo instructor because the name of the school is often found somewhere on the uniform, and a badge of the Taekwondo organization, WTF, ITF, ect., is often sown into the chest of the uniform. The same goes for the color of belt that the student wears is provided by the instructor with the purchase of a uniform, and as students test for new ranks, new color belts are awarded. Essentially, this really is all one needs to learn and practice Taekwondo. Where it is normal to train bare foot, it is acceptable to train in light weight shoes specifically designed for martial arts. 

As far as sparring equipment is concerned, the basic necessities are padded gloves and foot covers. For male competitors, a groin cup is also a necessity, and for both sexes, a mouth guard is also always required. In competitions, head gear is often required by all students until one competes as a black belt, but even then, most associations are moving towards padded head gear for all competitors. Again, all of this gear can be purchased through the instructor for a reasonable cost, or you can go to most sporting good stores to purchase all of the above. Some people choose to buy their own head gear, but it is common for instructors to provide these for tournaments. Because of the amount of kicks associated with Taekwondo, padded chin guards are worm by a growing number of competitors, but are not required by any associations. 

Should you not be able to afford such equipment, most organizations will subsidize the cost of equipment for students who are willing to help with fundraising opportunities, but this is only available through a school to school basis. But on the whole, when compared to sports like hockey or football, the cost of equipment is significantly lower. 
Where to Train With the popularity of taekwondo growing each year, the numbers of schools are growing in union. It is almost impossible for one to live in a city or town that does not have a school of one or more different organizations. The most important aspects to choosing a school are the instructor and the school itself. 

It is not uncommon to see young black belts starting up new schools, but the best instructors are those who hold higher ranks. In general, a black belt that has a higher rank has more knowledge to pass on, and can therefore train you to a higher rank than someone who is only a first degree. Knowledge is important, but the instructor must also embody the tenants of taekwondo being curtsey, integrity, perseverance, self control, and indomitable spirit. The main thing to look for in a Taekwondo instructor is someone who has heart. If they promise you a black belt in 2-3 years, then they are more in the business for the money. Taekwondo, like all martial arts, take ample dedication, and your instructor should reflect that aspect. 

The moment one walks into a dojo, it should be apparent that it is a place you want to train in. Whether the training hall is new or just a school gym doesn’t really matter, but what is important is the presence of other black belts. You can tell an instructor and school are successful when there are a number of black belts that stay with the school once they have worked their way through the ranks. In theory, the more black belts in a class, the more opportunities there are for you to learn different aspects of the martial art from more than one angle. Black belts are the center of pride when it comes to Taekwondo schools because it is they who are the ones out traveling, often paying out of their pocket, across North America and the world to compete in various national, international, and world championships. Their success reflects positively on the instructor and school. 
Conclusion To join Taekwondo is a life changing experience that will positively change your entire life. Its entire foundation lies in the tenants of Taekwondo: curtsey, integrity, perseverance, self control, and indomitable spirit. The ITF student oath sums up the life changing experience with its last two oaths being ""I shall be a champion of justice and freedom"" and ""I shall build a better and more peaceful world”. Even more, Taekwondo builds self consciousness and self awareness by setting goals that allows students of all ages succeed to greater heights than they could ever imagine. Once the basics are firmly in place, the sky truly is the limit. It is not uncommon for an instructor to tell someone to hold a board above your head, and tell you if you want to pass your test, you will break the board with a sidekick by simply jumping in the spot. One learns pretty quickly that in Taekwondo, the impossible breaks as easy as a board.",
Manga,"Manga InformationINTRODUCTIONGetting into Manga is just like getting into any other book series. The only thing is that if you have never read a manga before, the number of choices can be quite overwhelming and if you do not know how to distinguish between the different types, you may end up choosing manga that you will not enjoy. Manga is divided into a number of different categories and even along the lines of what is considered to be “boy” and “girl” manga.TYPES OF MANGAAs stated in the introduction there are a number of different types of Manga. The type does not necessarily fall into categories like sci-fi or fantasy but rather the way the story is written. Shojo manga is considered to be manga written for women and it is often written by women. Shonen manga on the other hand is considered to be written for young men. There are also other types of manga that are considered to be for specific age groups of men. In the US however Manga has so far only become popular with the young crowd and therefore most stores only sell Shojo and Shonen manga.The easiest difference to remember between Shonen and Shojo manga is that Shonen manga is usually filled with mostly action and limited character and story development. There is usually little angst and drama beyond what is necessary to advance the plat. Shojo on the other hand is typically filled with complex plots and characters and plenty of angst and drama. In Shojo manga, the emphasis is rarely on the action but more on the drama and romance between the characters.There are also types of sexually explicit manga that is available for all sexes and sexual preferences, these are rarely sold in major bookstores but can be found at online book sellers.POPULARITY OF MANGA IN JAPANJapan is not only the place that the Manga originated but it is also the place that Manga reigns supreme. It is not strange to see men and women of all ages reading Manga. It is even common of large sections of magazines to be dedicated to serial mangas. But not only is it common to have manga published in book and magazine format but a whole new form of manga has also been developing in Japan.Some Manga series are so popular that fans will write their own manga stories based on the popular series. These fanstories are called dojinshi. They can expand on stories already written in manga, rewrite the stories in their own way, simply include popular characters or they can even be completely original. These stories are even published and accounted for a $27 billion industry in Japan. Manga is so popular in Japan that people refuse to believe that their favorite series is done that they will pay for stories written by others in order to keep it gong.Popular Manga SeriesSome series of manga are increasingly most popular than others and these manga can extend for 30 books or more. Perhaps one of the most popular mangas as at least among women is Pretty Sailor Soldier Sailor Moon. This manga was also an anime series and it was the popularity of the anime that caused the manga to rise to popularity in the United States.Another popular manga is Bleach which is currently one of the best selling mangas in Japan and around the world.Other popular mangas include Naruto and Full Metal Alchemist. The best-selling manga series in Japan to date is One Piece. The manga series has sold over 6 million copies since 2008. The manga features the story of pirates on the search for the elusive treasure that will make them kings among pirates.MANGA AND ANIMEQuite often people will use the terms manga and anime interchangeably. It is true that many manga have been made into anime and vice versa but the terms are completely different. Manga solely refers to the graphic novels that are published in book form (and read back to front) and anime refers to the animated cartoons.It is important to note that even though manga and anime may be inspired off one another they can be completely different. For example the Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon manga was written almost entirely for young girls, but the anime was created to have a much broader appeal.Many people will have different preferences between manga and anime with many believing that the manga is much better than the anime and vice versa. The difference is that typically the anime will focus on the action part of the story while the manga will usually focus more on the characters and the story.",
Bartending,"Bartending Information Introduction What exactly do you do when you have nothing and I mean nothing at all and all you have around you is some wine glasses and some bottles. If I were you, I would surely have flashbacks of the movie “Coyote Ugly” going on in my mind. When it comes to bar tending, you can be assured there will never be a dull moment in your life. That`s because bar tending is one of those few things that could be real fun and exciting which is all the more reason for being pursued as a hobby. I mean lets admit it, what can be more fun than always trying out new stuff with different kinds of drinks with the end result being having a good time. So yeah, bar tending could be a great hobby because well, come to think of it, it offers you with everything that hobbies are all made up. 

Lets face it though, its not one of those hobbies that you`d like your kids to take up at an early age. Besides, its not that its illegal or something like that. I mean c`mon, there are bar tending schools all over the country and they`re doing a pretty good job by providing bars with great bar tenders. So before you get all hyped up with pursuing this as your hobby, there are some things that you ought to know. Bar tending is a responsibility and it doesn`t just involve mixing different types of drinks, its also important to hear out the other patrons. Even the bar tending schools consider this to be important since the job of a bar tender is more like taking care of its patrons. 
Why Bartend First of all, you have got to remember that bar tending is not all that cheezy and low life job that you used to see in the old Western movies. On the contrary, it can be quite a reputable establishment these days around. So if you want to play smart, you should make the most of this hobby and turn it into something really big. Okay, we’re not talking about you opening up your own bar just because we told you to, but if you’re good enough, what the hell, why not right? You’d be surprised to know the various techniques that are involved by mixing drinks to make really good cocktails and other drinks. 

But you should also know that bar tending is not all about drinks, chatting over with a few friends and the good life. As a bar tender, you also have to keep a tab on the customers walking in and pay heed to their drinking habits. Training is the key to master the art of bar tending unless of course you want your drinks to taste like feet. Okay, we’ll be honest here, bar tending will not always mean that you’ll be in certain situations you might have seen in one of the most popular soaps “Cheers”. Nope, that isn’t going to happen. Attitude, patience and the proper bar tending skills are the three most important traits required to learn and live the bar tending life. Apart from these three traits, if you happen to possess people skills, it’ll be like a feather in your cap for your achievements. 
How to start So if you’re into bar tending as much as I thought you are, lets walk you through about mixing drinks. Creating drinks is something really artistic but at the same time, it depends upon the taste of the person mixing it. The most common lesson that you are bound to learn in any bar tending school will be shaking, pouring over a spoon, etc. These would be the simplest techniques when it comes to bar tending which is more than perfect if you tend to bar tend within the comforts of your own private bar at home. Now lets get on with some of the techniques shall we. 

Shaking is a good technique when it comes to preparing drinks that contains fruit juices, cream and even eggs for that matter. With these ingredients in the drink, it becomes obvious that the drink needs to be shaken. When shaking, you simply have to use the cocktail shaker which in turn helps you to mix the contents in the drink and at the same time serve it chilled which is exactly what your patrons are looking for in the first place. The best way to do this is by freezing the drink and then breaking it down with the contents in the cocktail shaker. You will know that the drink is ready to be served when you see some drops of water condensed on the surface of the shaker, This will ensure that the drink is chilled enough after which you have to finish off the deed by straining the drink. 

Okay now, most of the cocktail shakers come with a built in strainer. In order to strain, it is important that you should have used ice cubes and not crushed ice since its obvious that the crushed ice will clog your strainer. Besides, if ever the patron asks you to serve any drink with crushed ice, you should never strain it. How many times have you heard the phrase “shaken not stirred” by our very own James Bond? Stirring a drink would include stirring it in a mixing glass with either a glass or a small metal rod. Then of course, muddling is the best when you want to bring out the flavor in the drink especially if it consists of fruit juices, mint garnishes or something like that. The best way to do this is by crushing the content (ingredient) with the help of a muddler on the back of a bar spoon or pestle. 

Speaking of bar tending, how can we even forget about the ever so great flaming. As you might have already seen sometime, flaming is nothing but lighting a cocktail or any other alcohol which is typically done to bring out the flavor in the drink. But hey, since this method obviously involves playing with fire and that too in a literal sense, it is advised that you maintain some caution. We say this because there are some drinks that may have relatively more alcohol content in them which might as well result in the drink to ignite rather furiously. One word of caution here, never let anyone drink up a flaming drink, always extinguish it before serving. 
Conclusion

So now that you know what bar tending has to offer which is nothing but for you and to keep people happy, there is no reason to back away from this hobby. While practicing/training for it, who knows, you might even get used to flair bar tending which is bar tending taken to a whole new level.",
Model Diecast Cars,"Model Diecast Cars InformationINTRODUCTIONCollecting model cars provides a great outlet for automobile to own a variety of different models of their favorite cars. There are two different varieties of model cars: the die cast models and vehicle kits. The die cast models are of very high quality and more accurately depict the real thing. They are usually designed on a scale of 1:10, 1:12, 1:18, 1:24 and 1:43 to the real model. The die cast models usually average 10 to 12 inches in length thus making them the perfect size for your bookshelf or other display case. If you are able to secure current Limited Edition releases and some of the older vintage models, you are making a great investment as these models cars appreciate in value. This is a perfect way for a collector to make a little profit off a collection, but you have to be prepared to scope the market in order to know the best time to sell.GETTING STARTED COLLECTING MODEL CARSWhile it can be an expensive hobby, getting started collecting model cars is quite easy. If you are serious about becoming a collector of model die cast cars, you may wish to conduct some research in order to locate some of the online forums and message boards that are designed for those who are interested in asking questions and just generally discussing their hobby. Once you have enough information you can visit some of the online stores for great deals on models you are seeking as well as locating some helpful and informative books.Most people think of collecting as something children do, but no matter what your age may be, collecting model cars can be a fun and exciting hobby. There are even some people—male and female-- who make a business out of a hobby that was once dominated by males.One of the first things you need to do when you begin collecting model die cast cars is to make a decision about the scale you wish to seek: 1:8, 1:18, 1:24, 1:43 and 1:87 with the most popular for collector`s being the 1:43 scale. This scale offers a wide range of models either as die cast models or vehicle kits you can put together yourself. The majority of collectors enjoy collecting models of a particular brand, racing cars of just cars they love and previously owned.When you begin looking for your first model car, you will discover some of the most beautiful models are the classic cars that were built during the 1920s and 1930s especially the Rolls Royces and Bugattis. There are several miniature vintage cars available for sale if you conduct some research. While the hobby of model car collecting is fun and exciting on its own, it also opens another avenue: the potential for collectors to develop relationships with other collectors. The community is one of camaraderie amongst collectors who are more than willing to help other collectors find the rare model car they are seeking.THE BEGINNING OF MODEL CAR COLLECTINGThe origin of model car collecting goes back to the post World War II era and the Ace and Berkeley wooden model cars. Derk Brand in England is responsible for production of a 1932 Ford Roadster, the very first plastic model car kit. His later contributions included the production of model car kits for both the Gowland Brothers in England and Revell in the United States.As a result of this early interest in model cars, the majority of auto manufacturers provided their dealers with promotional models on a scale of 1:25. The trend escalated as children got to play with the promotional model cars and either traded them or engaged in collecting them as a hobby. The hobby of model car collecting really gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s when promotional cars actually became a profitable venture. This was during the same time that AMT, Revell, Jo-Han and Monnoram started producing model cars.CURRENT TRENDS IN MODEL CAR COLLECTINGThe model car kits that are available in today`s market are much more technologically advanced and include intricate photo etched details, adhesive chrome foil to show the chrome trim, wiring for the engine and aluminum billeted parts. The kit is designed so the collector can add details to the model car so it closely resembles an authentic car. These model cars are called Dinky cars and come equipped with die cast alloy bodies and rubber tires just like the kind you find on real cars. In order to make them appear even more authentic the model kits come with drivers and passengers. During the World War II era some manufacturers designed some unique military cars that were equipped with tanks, caterpillar tracks and rotating turrets.Model car collectors frequently auction off the rarer models some of which sell for thousands of dollars. In today`s market sellers of die cast model cars can obtain the maximum profit with the NASCAR diet cast models gaining the most popularity with model car collectors. It is important for those who are new to collecting to realize it will take some time before they will be able to accumulate the entire collection.Another thing for beginners and all collectors to remember is to only collect those items that you really want to own. It can be very expensive to engage in the hobby of collecting model die cast cars, so you only want to collect those models that you really love which is why most collectors do a great deal of shopping around before they invest money into a new item for their collection. By taking the time to shop around they can trade the cars they purchase easier or sell them at a higher profit than they would if they rushed into a transaction.Experts advise against staying with one specific type of die cast model. They feel having a diverse collection is more beneficial for those collectors who wish to make a profit off their hobby. While it may appear you are getting a bargain today, that very model may appreciate dramatically over the next few years.Purchasing older die cast car models is an excellent way to not only add a new model to your collection but also to earn you a substantial profit in the future. It doesn`t matter if the model looks outdated—there is always the possibility that there is a collector looking for that particular model in order to complete a collector or sell it to make a profit.WHERE TO FIND MODEL CARSIt may seem strange, but some of the best deals on die cast model cars are in flea markets, on eBay and other auctions sites and in forums dedicated to model car collecting. These resources can help you locate some of the pieces you may need for your own collection as well as help you develop contacts for any models you are seeking to resell. If you are not familiar with how the bid sites like eBay work, the short training lesson is you set a starting price for bids. Collectors will begin to place bids, and if the demand is high enough you can earn a pretty nice profit. Some people who sell on auction sites also choose to set a reserve price which means if there are not enough bids to meet that minimum price (the reserve price) the seller does not have to sell the item even to the highest bidder.While many people do choose to purchase die cast model cars in department and hobby shops, those models are not as well constructed as the ones you are likely to find in a collector`s shop. Collectors who are also interested in making a good profit with their hobby need to develop their negotiation skills so they know the best time to sell.Another thing that is important to know about model car collectors is they can become very focused when they are looking for a particular item to add to their collection. They will do whatever they need to do, and some will pay whatever the price is to find a model that is not readily available. It is understandable that a rare die cast model car can be quite expensive, but for those who are patient, it will eventually find its way into their prized collection.At one time collectors could only find collectable model cars at auctions, estate sales or flea markets, but the Internet has changed all that. By spending some time on the Internet it is possible to find even those very rare models that are otherwise almost impossible to find. Once you know what item you are seeking, you can go to some specific websites in order to quickly find what you what or obtain sources of supply. The longer you continue collecting, the larger your collection will become. Over time you can build up a collection that has the potential to be worth a fortune at some time in the future.ACCESSORIES FOR MODEL CARSMany serious collectors look to make entire playsets out of their model car collections. In order to accommodate these collectors many manufacturers offer items such as toy restaurants and filling stations. While these items do not come with the model cars, you can buy them separately if you feel inclined to do so. Another optional item is the toy raceway that is sold for die cast cars—these have become much more complicated in recent years and now involves loops and extremely complicated curves. Carrying cases are also available and are designed specifically with children in mind so the little ones can travel without having to leave their cars at home.Die cast metal cars that are assembled at the factory and build to scale are becoming more and more geared toward adult collectors instead of taking on the aura of a toy. These models are available in scales such as 1:12, 1:18, 1:24, 1:43 and 1:64 just to name a few. The smaller scales became popular first with the others gaining popularity after World War II and during the 1950s.",
Kite Flying Making,"Kite Flying Making Information  Introduction Making and flying kites is a hobby and a tradition practiced in many countries around the world. Kites can be used for research and science as well as just a wonderful way to enjoy the outdoors. Kite fanciers and flyers also gather regularly for different types of events that show new kite designs, kite models, technology and even test kite flyers ( also known as pilots) abilities and style. 

In the Middle East as well as in parts of the USA, kite fighting is a recognized type of competition. In these events two or more kite flyers attempt to bring down or control their opponent`s kites using a strict set of rules. These competitions are great to watch and show some extremely high levels of aerodynamics and control over the airborne kites. 

However, kite flying can also be done for the sheer enjoyment of controlling the kite. Kids, adults and even seniors can enjoy a wonderful breezy day by spending time outside flying their kites. To add to this creating your own uniquely designed kite either from scratch or by a kit is a wonderful way to learn about the various types and designs of kites and how they fly. Some kites are also designed to be flown indoors, providing opportunity for year round kite flying fun. 

Adding technology to kites has increased their educational and fun value as well. Small cameras can be attached to the kite to take amazing video or still pictures from the kite`s vantage over the neighborhood or area. Wider ranging shots are also available with the high altitude kites. 

Last but certainly not least kites are made and flown for a variety of different cultural events and celebrations. Wonderful dragon kites, beautiful Easter kites and even kites used to lift people into the air or move them across water are also routinely seen over the summer months or on special holidays. Researching about different kite designs and motifs is an excellent way to spend cold winter months in preparation for the spring kite flying weather. 
Materials and Methods Of Building Kites Historically kites have been developed from easily available materials within a particular country there are a wide range of options for building and designing a kite. Typically and traditionally the frame is of a lightweight wood or very durable yet flexible plastic, however not all kites have a frame and some are designed without a solid frame of any kind. Now more and more kites are built of very lightweight, highly durable polymers and polyesters, making kites much more long lived even with regular use outdoors. 

It is important to understand the definitions or terms used in kite building and kite flying. The following are the main components of kites, just keep in mind that not all kites have all the same components and the use of the various elements is largely dependant on the shape and design of the kite itself. 

- Spine – the vertical or long backbone type of stick used in any types of kites such as diamond shaped or square shapes 

- Spar – the shorter cross pieces of wood or plastic that either are horizontal or slanted into the spine 

- Frame – the combination of the spine and the spars, or the shaped pieces in box types of kites 

- Bridle – the strings that attach to the spine and the spars or along the frame and then connect to the flying line 

- Flying line – the thin rope of string that provides contact with the reel in your hand to control the movement of the kite in the air 

- Cover – the paper, cloth or plastic that covers the frame to provide wind resistance to allow the kite to fly 

- Tail – may or may not be present and hangs down from the frame or spine to provide additional balance. Kites often don`t need tails but they are used to add color and movement to the kite while in the air 

A simple diamond kite can be constructed using easy to find household and garden items. You will need bamboo doweling, often used as garden stakes, or flat, lightweight straight sticks that are approximately 100 cm and 85 cm in length. 

The longest stick is placed flat on a surface and the shorter stick is placed perpendicular to form a cross shape. The shorter stick (the spar) can be closer to the top of the long stick (the spine) or it can be more towards the middle. It is important to make sure the spar is equally balanced on both sides of the spine to keep the frame of the kite symmetrical. 

Use dab of good quality glue to keep the spine and spar in place. Use butcher cord or a very thin gardening twine to wrap the joint and keep both sticks firmly in place. Cut a notch in the end of each end of the spine and spar deep enough to allow you to stretch the twine or cord around to form the edges of the kite wings. 

Starting at the top of the spin wrap the twine, make a loop out of the top and back down into the groove, then continue to one side of the spar, inserting the string through the notch. At the bottom of the spine repeat the looping process, then take the string around to the other spar and back up to the top of the spine. Wrap the string and tie securely, you should now have the full frame completed. 

Place the frame on a large piece of butcher paper or moderately heavy plastic. Cut a diamond shape that is at least 3 cm larger than the string frame. Decorate the outside of the paper or fabric using markers, paint or crayons, then fold the extra edge over the string and glue into place. 

Allow the kite to dry overnight and then measure a piece of twine that is 120cm in length. Fold in half and tie a small loop knot in the middle, which is where the flying line will attach. Tie each end to the loop at the ends of the spine and attach the flying line. Add a tail that is made of a length of twine with small ribbons tied on every 10-15cm. You can also use streamers or longer strips of plastic with or without the cross bows. 

Another type of kite that is fun and simple to make is very traditional in Bermuda. Using a spoke like frame of thin, lightweight sticks these kites are nailed together at the center of the wheel, then string is used to create concentric circles. Colored tissue paper is glued to the string and the spokes to create hexagonal patterns of various colors. A longer stick is then attached to the center and string and tissue connects the tip of the stick to the body of the kite, forming an elongated triangle. 

The tail is attached to the kite and is required in order for the kite to stay balanced and fly correctly without spinning and crashing. 

Box kites are constructed with four parallel struts, which are similar to four spines forming the corners of each of the boxes. Diagonal spars are then placed at the top and bottom of the struts or spines to keep everything square and equidistant. Wide fabric, usually nylon or paper, is then wrapped around the top third and the bottom third of the frame, leaving the middle third open. The bridle is attached to the middle of the kite and tails are attached to the bottom of the box. Multi-unit box kites are known as cellular kites and can have a variety of sizes, tails and sails to help with stability and balance while in the air. 

These kites are more challenging to construct since balance and dimensions are absolutely essential to creating a kite that can become airborne and stay balanced in the sky. Patterns are available online or in kite making books that provide the specific measurements of the struts and spars as well as the covered and open areas of the kite. Surprisingly these box kites are extremely effective fliers and are good in heavier winds that may be too much for the lighter and more traditional diamond shaped kites. 

Trying out new types of designs and modifying existing plans is all part of the fun of building and flying your own kites. For the more elaborate types of kites such as the box kites and multi-unit kites kits are available from craft stores and hobby websites that provide you with the frames and materials necessary. Of course you can also buy kites already constructed, but most individuals that enjoy this hobby love the creative side of kite construction and decoration, not just the experience of flying the kite. 
Competitions and Events Around The World Within the USA sport kite competitions and events have become extremely popular. These events, often hosted and presented by the American Kitefliers Association, provide kite flyers, also known as pilots, the ability to try out their stunt flying skills. Unlike simpler kites the sport kites are multi-line kites that compete in aerial ballet, compulsory figures and kite flying to music. Teams of pilots compete in highly imaginative kite maneuvers, similar to what you may expect to see of planes flying in formation at an air show. 

Unlike standard kites the sport kite is designed to withstand winds of up to 30 miles per hour. They are also very lightweight and some can even be flown indoors. The materials used in these kites are very high tech ranging from ripstop polyester and carbon fiber tuber for the frames. Depending on the size and style of kite these sports kites can a be a great way to learn how to very accurately control the movement of the kite using both flying lines. Very elaborate four flying line options are also available but are considerably more challenging and difficult to fly and control. 

Large types of kites can also be used for kite surfing, kite landboarding and kite buggying as well as snow kiting. In these activities large kites that are typically frameless bow type kites, made from the very durable ripstop polyester fabric, are used to generate the power to pull a human on some type of wheeled frame or a flat board. The kites are controlled by flying lines at either end of the bow, allowing for turns and speed control depending on the position of the hands and the pull up or down on the flying line. The flying lines are much heavier than with a traditional kite and typically attaché to a control bar that the pilot uses to manage the speed and direction of the kite. These kites can be up to 21 square meters in size, some in recent competitions even topped those dimensions. 

This type of kiting does require some additional safety equipment. Helmets and protective gear are highly recommended at all times and are mandatory in competitions. In addition each individual sport that uses kite power has different safety requirements such as lifejackets, safety hook knives to cut the lines should the pilot loose control or even an impact vest that adds additional protection to the chest and torso area of the rider. 
Conclusion Flying a kite is a great activity for the whole family. Not only can everyone get involved in building and decorating the kite, but they can also learn to fly and control the kite. Multi-kite or sub-kite units can be flown by more than one person, a terrific way to learn teamwork and coordination. 

Safety is an important consideration for kite flying. An open field, park or beach free from any power lines or towers is absolutely essential. Avoiding crowded areas where kites can be a hazard to other visitors is also a very important consideration especially if you are kite fighting or trying out new types of kites that you may not be familiar with controlling. A kite that crashes to the ground can be dangerous to anyone watching or in the general area so always keep a close eye on your surroundings before putting your kite into the air.",
Airplane Flight,"Airplane Flight Information  Intro If you have ever fantasized about flying a plane, soaring through the skies, the good news is you can turn this fantasy into reality. Airplane flight is a hobby that a lot of people are taking up these days- thanks to the numerous flight schools that offer a variety of excellent courses in flying, whether you are looking for a career as a pilot, or whether you are just looking at flying for fun. 

Flying can be an exciting hobby and it gives you a totally new perspective on life. It is challenging as well as rewarding, and it is an experience that you will always enjoy. Flying is also a unique hobby because not everyone has the will, aptitude or attitude to pursue it. But for those who are passionate about it, with the right resources and information, there is great scope. 

In the US, a commercial pilot can earn a living by flying an aircraft. But before actually considering flying as a career or hobby, it is important to meet certain eligibility criteria of the Federal Aviation Administration or FAA. You must have the ability to understand, speak, read and write English, in addition to holding a private pilot or higher certificate issued by the FAA. There are also knowledge tests and practical flying tests to pass through first. You would also need to meet requirements related to the commercial pilots license that relates to type of plane and the commercial class rating being applied for. 
So, How To Get Started? Learning to fly is the first step because there is no way you can just get into an aircraft and take off without the requisite knowledge and the license. You can become eligible for a pilot’s license via these options: 

• Attend classes at an FAA approved school 

• Through home study 

• A combination of both You will need to find out the specific minimum requirements for the kind of license you plan to apply for. If you are looking for a student permit, then the minimum age could be 14 years. A pilot permit needs you to be 17 years old to fly a gyroplane. For recreational and ultra light aircraft, you need to be 16 years old. 

Although, flying, as a hobby is easily accessible, there is some expense involved in terms of flying lessons and renting aircrafts when you want to fly. Those who can afford their own aircraft will also need to take into account maintenance and repair costs. 
Learning To Fly We can generally categorize the process of learning to fly into two parts: 

• Ground school covers the training that you need in theory that can be applied at the time of flying the aircraft. You will have to go through courses in the basics of navigation, aerodynamics, etc. This knowledge is then tested and graded. You will need to pass this test. 

• Flight school comes next. Here, it is vital to get a good instructor. You will probably cover your ground school and flight school in 60 - 80 hours. Here is how you go about it, step by step: 

1. You will start with the pre-solo lessons where you will learn the basic info on how to fly a plane. You will learn to inspect a plane before a flight, how to taxi into the runway, how to take off and land on your own. After you become proficient at this, you will go on to flying solo. Here you will learn to identify the changing weather patterns so that you know how to judge good flying conditions and develop the ability to know about the airport traffic operation. You also learn how the aircraft works, its various parts, etc. 

2. Now, it is time to learn the various maneuvers with the aircraft like climbing, rolling, etc. You will really have fun flying cross-country. You might be accompanied by your flight instructor the first few times, until you are confident enough to go on your own. This brings you to the stage where you can seek private pilot certification. This involves a practical test, after which, you must go through the FAA exam. 

3. Next comes the license part. Just like our regular car driving licenses, there are different levels of pilot’s licenses- starting from student licenses, non-pro and professional licenses. You can get a student license fairly easily as it is similar to a learner’s license. The private pilot’s license allows you to fly a personal aircraft. 
How Can You Become A Commercial Pilot Before you apply for a commercial pilot’s license, you would need to attend ground and flight school. First, you would need to get your private pilot license, after which you can apply for the commercial license. Flight schools that offer training for private licenses can also train you for the commercial pilot licenses. This would mostly cover the small propeller driven aircrafts, followed by specialized training for jets and large commercial airliners that cover the passenger aircraft and air cargo aircrafts too. Invariably, even though you’ve got your commercial license, some of the major airlines would want you to go through their own flight school. 
Joining The US Air Force It is obvious from the above that you can enjoy flying both as a hobby and an exciting career. But there is yet another way to get your pilot’s license without spending a dime! And that is by joining the Air Force, of course! Here you can get trained for free – in fact, you would even get paid as you go through the flight school. The catch, if you consider it as one, is that you will be with the Air Force for a stipulated number of years. When you leave, though, you will have a license, the necessary training and experience on the aircraft that you were trained on. If you wish to pursue a career as a commercial pilot after you leave the Air Force, you might need to get some additional aircraft specific training. As we mentioned earlier, the major airlines will put you through their own training and as their employee, you will be paid for this. Naturally, your military experience will be an advantage when you apply with a big airline company for a job. 
More Scope You could also spread your wings a little farther if you would like to go abroad. Many developing countries have a demand for airline services, for both passenger and cargo. In addition to this, there are wealthy people who travel only in their private aircrafts and jets. With your commercial license and experience, you stand a pretty good chance of getting a job as you train further. 

That said, airplane flight – whether as a hobby or a career – is a great responsibility for the pilot – in terms of the aircraft and the passengers who fly with you. That is why it is so crucial that you train yourself really well before you take off. 

The information given above is only to get you started. For more information and tips to help you take up airplane flight as a hobby, stay at Discover A Hobby and watch the following instructional in-depth videos and excellent books on flying. Enjoy the videos as you see professional pilots in action. You will also find valuable links that can tell you all that you want to know about airplane flight. So, get the information, and take off!",
Novel Writing,"Novel Writing Information  Introduction Novel writing has fascinated people for centuries, telling stories, sharing experiences, and providing hope, fear, and love to millions of avid readers. Long before the advent of the television and the current age of mutli-media, novels were the primary form of entertainment for a majority of individuals. 

Writing down stories is often challenging for most writers, and novels pose the greatest challenge due to their depth, length, and sheer chemistry of prose, style, voice, and characters than build from one chapter to the next. Thousands of people wake up every morning with the desire to write a novel. They have an idea they want to share. Having this desire and seeing it through from the first page to the last, however, can seem daunting. 

Most would-be novelists lose their way somewhere along the path. For those lost souls, it doesn’t have to end in a Greek tragedy. 
Equipment Needed to Write a Novel What makes novel writing such an inspiration for so many people is that it requires very little in the way of material things. Most modern novelists use a computer and a word-processing software program, such as Microsoft Word to create their tomes. Most agents and editors currently accept submissions using Word only, though many still accept hard copy as well. 

Some writers feel an inherent connection to the pen and paper and write manually. Some even use traditional typewriters. If the goal is publication on some level, then writing the novel on a computer or other word processing program is the safest option. 

If a person doesn’t own a computer and has no interest in one, there are relatively inexpensive processing programs that are designed specifically for the person of writing. One can also purchase a flash-drive (also known commonly as a thumb drive) for a computer and use a computer and basic word processing program on a local public library computer. 

Far too many novels become derailed before they even have an opportunity to evolve with excuses, and not having the right equipment is one of those excuses. More on these next. 

If a person has the desire, writing a novel is possible. The equipment, really, is secondary. 
How to Start: Part 1 – The Excuses Writing a novel requires dedication and perseverance. Having a solid idea is one thing, but without the desire and determination, no idea is going to be enough to carry a novel through from beginning to end. Writing is a solitary art and requires the author to disconnect from the rest of the world, and family, for the time that he or she is working on the novel. 

Often, in the beginning of the promise, it is exciting and refreshing, but in time, it can become to feel like work. Unpaid work. This is where the excuses surface. The first step in writing a novel is to eliminate any and all excuses from one’s vocabulary. Temptations will alight at every corner, and some will be enough to stop the novel before it’s even begun. 

Set a schedule 

Life in modern times is hectic. It can be overwhelming at times. From work to family life, charity work to obligations, it can be difficult to find the time to devote to a novel. Set a schedule as though it’s for a job that pays every week. Don’t be late for your scheduled writing time and don’t cut out early. 

Write for you 

When writing a novel, it can be easy to feel as though your idea is the best thing since Catcher in the Rye or Gone With the Wind, and that you are going to become the next Stephen King. If you plan on writing for fame and fortune, the process is going to become overwhelming and those long hours staring at a blank page will draw out like a long winter night with the power out. Then writing will truly begin to feel like work. And it shouldn’t. 

Expect challenges 

The first pages may flow as smooth as silk, but this certainly won’t be the case for the entire novel, unless you are gifted and blessed. Writing is going to feel like work. Expect this in the beginning because if you don’t, then it will be tempting and appealing and almost seem justifiable to put off the writing work one day. 

Then that one day will lead to two and the two will roll into a week. Before you know it, a month or a year will have passed and that idea will feel stale and the idea of finishing that novel will seem like a childhood pipe dream. 

Excuses will kill a novel before it has a chance to breathe and grow. Don’t let any excuses infiltrate the process. When you are aware of them, address them, and focus on them in the beginning, then you can head them off at the pass when you are into the heart of your novel. 
How to Start: Part 2 – Reading Writers write. A lot. They also read. Voraciously. By reading, both wonderful novels and terrible ones, a writer absorbs different styles, begins to learn about character, voice, tempo, rhythm, and all of the elements that make fiction work as an art form. There is no excuse for a writer to not read. None whatsoever. 

If there is a television program that you absolutely can’t live without, but it invades the little time you have to devote to writing your novel, then you have another built-in excuse not to finish it. 

It’s not only important to read other novels, but also instructional books on how to write a novel, how to develop character, and all of the other aspects of good novel writing. By reading these types of books, one can garner a great deal of information on the basics. 

Is it helpful to enroll in writing courses? Absolutely. Is it necessary in order to write a novel? No, but the level of writing that one produces will often be correlated to the amount of time and effort that he or she devotes to the study of the craft. As with any artistic endeavor, there are certainly going to be inept writers who find massive success and significantly talented and accomplished writers who are relegated to the annals of writing obscurity. 

By reading everyday, whether it’s a newspaper, novel, memoir, or instructional book, for example, a writer builds his or her skills naturally. 
The Process Writing a novel is generally the same as writing anything else, such as a short story, but it is done on a much larger scale. A novel may have dozens of characters, multiple plot lines, and numerous scenes, all moving toward one ultimate conclusion. A novel can also focus on few characters and one or two settings, but will also encompass a wide berth of tension. 

When setting out to write a novel, an idea is generally the spark that ignites its birth. Some writing instructors will teach that the idea should be evolved and explored before the first sentence is written. Others will promote the notion that a novel should be a free-formed expression, that the characters and the settings begin to evolve and light the way toward the conclusion, much as real-life is encountered. No one field of thought is right, nor is one better than the other. Experiment with your own approach to writing a novel, but if you have written short stories in the past for example, then you already have your method of writing determined. 

The difference of drafts 

Write your first draft with your heart. Write your second draft with your head. This is one of the age-old and tried and true bits of advice that is passed onto novelists for generations. 

Novel writing is a process of drafts. No novel was ever created in its final form on the first draft. Too many inexperienced novelists spend an enormous amount of time and energy writing, editing, and then writing and editing their first draft of their novel and end up stuck in one place. This is the best way to derail a novel in progress. 

Write the first draft of the novel without worrying about how it sounds. Put the idea down on paper, moving from one sentence to the next. Never, ever go back and read a sentence you wrote with the intention of editing. Don’t worry about how it scans, forget about typos or misspellings or grammatical faux-pas. That’s the work of the second draft. 

When you commit to the first draft without worrying about editing, then the idea is giving free reign to run amuck and explore all of its glorious possibilities. Will anyone see your completed first draft? That’s entirely up to you, but ideally no one should be invited into this little world that you have created while it’s still coming to life. Any comment or question a person may have when reading the first draft could influence the idea, push it in another direction, which could ultimately destroy the novel in the end. 

People often ask how many drafts they should expect to write before the novel is complete. There is no easy answer to that question, but a minimum of three usually works for most writers. Some novelists have been known to generate ten, fifteen, or more drafts of their work, though these subsequent drafts are more like edits, fine-tuning characters, prose, and other dynamics. 

Once the first draft is complete, then it’s time to celebrate. Place the novel in a drawer for some time. A few weeks, at least. Go out and celebrate this accomplishment and it is a significant accomplishment because, while many people talk about writing a novel, few actually finish one. 

Once your novel has had time to ferment in the drawer, when the characters are no longer fresh in your mind and the story begins to raise some questions for you, then it’s time to bring it back out into the light of day. That’s when it’s time to re-read it through, from start to finish and make notes along the way. 

Then you’re ready to tackle the second draft. 
Frequently Asked Questions When writing a novel, there are generally a thousand questions that come across the author’s mind. New writers will have far more questions than answers. Some of the most common questions are as follows: 

How long is a novel? 

There is some debate on length of a novel, but generally speaking, a novel consists of over 40,000 words. Anything less than that would fall into the characterization of a novella. Most modern novels range from between 60,000 and 100,000 words. For first time authors, anything over 100,000 words will make publication through traditional means much more difficult. 

One shouldn’t begin to write a novel with a word count in mind. It should flow as naturally as possible and on the second draft, any issues or concerns with length can be addressed and changes made at that time. 

What if my idea has already been written? 

Just about every idea that will be thought of has already been written. It doesn’t matter. Each person’s approach will be unique and that is what is important. Make sure that you don’t plagiarize, copy characters without permission of the original author, or steal passages from another author. 

If you feel that your idea is too similar to another recent novel, or a classic, then allow the idea to ferment in your mind for some time. Odds are you will catch a new angle on and old idea and that will make it truly unique. 

What are my publication options? 

Publication in the modern age is wide open, depending on what your goals are. If you wish to become the next New York Times Bestselling author, then you will need to write incredibly well, and go through the traditional publishing houses, which can take years following the completion of the novel to bring it to print. 

If you only want to write something for posterity, meaning you wish your friends and family to have a copy and don’t care too much about becoming the next Stephen King, then there are dozens of self-publishing and print-on-demand services that you can use to get your book into bound printed form. 
Conclusion Novel writing is a long and sometimes arduous process, but like so many wonderful forms of art, it can be incredibly rewarding. Novel writing can answer important questions of one’s own life, help them delve into the secrets of their happiness, or sadness, and can open up doors to a future they may never have seen otherwise. 

Writing and writing well are two completely different things, but one always comes first. Write and write now.",
Acting,"Acting Information  Introduction Who hasn’t stood in front of the mirror in their bathroom, looked at their reflection, and then broken into some manner of acting? Whether reciting a Shakespearean verse, a line from their favorite movie, or simply performing an improvisation routine for their own enjoyment, people have long pretended to be actors within the confines and comfort of their own home. Most typically, this occurs either in the bathroom or the bedroom, where they have some privacy, where other members of the household can’t see them, hear them, or make fun of them. 

Acting has been the focus of many philosophical discussions about its origins as well as its purpose. For some, acting is nothing more than entertainment, allowing an audience to escape their daily lives for a little while, to shake of the stress of work, family, neighbors, and everything else that seems to encompass most of our lives on a regular basis. Acting, whether it is through plays, movies, comedy skits, or straight improvisation, may help the audience to simply connect with each other, as a meeting place or social function. Acting is then merely the glue that brings and binds all of these people together, and offers them some common ground to talk about once the performance has ended. 

For others, acting is a way to bring about social or moral injustice to light, to spread gospel of religion, politics, or personal beliefs. While many actors do not actually write the content that they perform, acting in itself could every well be a pulpit from which writers spread their beliefs to others. 

In our modern society, acting has taken on much more significance than it has at any other time throughout our history. Actors of television programs, movies, or Broadway shows, for example, are revered, held high on a pedestal of respect. These celebrities inspire millions more people around the world to want to live that lifestyle, to seek the fame and fortune that comes from being a part of a major production. But at the same time, these actors, whether they are performing on the big screen, the small screen, or on stage, often do a disservice to the entire notion of acting. 

There are those actors who excel and become starlets of popular fame due to their inherent or trained talents, yet there are too many that only gain popularity for their off-screen, or off-stage behaviors. Acting offers people much more than a few hours of entertainment and can offer the actor himself or herself the opportunity to explore his or her inner self, to share something innate with others. 

Most actors perform in local presentations, and their names are known to only a few people within their community. They don’t act for money, fame, or fortune. They don’t act for accolades. They act for the enjoyment it brings them, for the ability to reach deep within their own life and experiences to share them with others. Acting can help one overcome shyness, past trauma, or release energy that builds up inside. 

Acting has come a long way throughout the centuries, but at its core, it is the same today as it was thousands of years ago in Greek tragedies. 
Getting Started in Acting Anyone can become an actor. There are few things in this world that can be open to anyone and everyone. People of any age can begin to act. Acting isn’t like taking to sports where a person needs to train from an early age, generally in childhood, to become a professional or take part in competitive games and competitions. Acting is open to all individuals, regardless of any handicaps or shortcomings. 

Elderly men and women often take to acting later in life in an effort to fill a void within their own life that retirement has left them with, or to attempt to connect with others within their community. People who can’t walk, those born with mental deficiencies, the sick and infirm, and the healthy and virulent are more than capable of acting, given the right support and training. 

In fact, anyone can act, with or without any proper training. The level of performance will generally be affected by the training or lack thereof that one receives. It can be compared to those individuals who enjoy singing. Anyone who can speak can open their mouths and sing, though many would argue that there are certain people who have no inherent musical ability and are generally tone-deaf (meaning that they can’t hit the right notes, no matter what they try to do). Acting is similar to singing in this aspect. 

If you can stand up and recite lines from a play or movie, then you can act. Actually, there are some actors who never utter a word of dialogue, so if a person can inflect with movement, even the most subtle hand gestures, can be an actor. 

Christopher Reeve gained fame and popularity for his role as Superman in the nineteen-seventies and nineteen-eighties movie franchise. He was professionally trained and received critical acclaim for his acting throughout the years. Yet when he was thrown from a horse and suffered a broken neck and was paralyzed from the neck down, many considered his acting career to be over. In fact, Christopher Reeve proved these people wrong and showed the world that one doesn’t need to be able to move in order to act. 

When you want to begin your own acting career, or you know somebody who wants to start acting, then the first best step would be to find an acting coach. There shouldn’t be any reason to spend a considerable amount of money paying for the earliest acting lessons. Many community theaters will have the resources to help you find the right person to help you with your journey into acting. There are those actors who will charge several hundred dollars per session, but this should only be reserved for professionals seeking a serious career in acting. 

Contact your local community theater and find out if there are volunteers, other actors who perform regularly for the company, who might be willing to offer some guidance and instruction. In most communities, there are several people who will offer their services for free because of their love and passion for this art form.  
Set up a video camera The next thing that you can do is to set up a video camera on a tripod, pick up a few familiar scripts –plays or movie scripts that you are familiar with- and act out certain scenes in front of the camera. Then go back and watch your performance. Judge it fairly and try to determine whether your performance came across as you had hoped or if it fell somewhat short of your expectations. This is a great way to see your mannerisms, eye contact, and inflection of your voice. 

Many people act and think that their performance was stellar, but what they don’t see is the subtle nuances that can affect any performance. What one might deem as being ideal, upon review of the video recording, could come across as something much less than that. Please note, at this point, that any judgment about one’s performance, regardless of whether it’s the first time or the one-hundredth time acting, is that the video is there to offer you clear insight into the performance and shouldn’t be used as a judge to make you give up.  
Find other actors in the region Just as with music, we enjoy performing with other people who share our similar passions. Community theater offers many individuals the opportunity to perform full-length plays and productions for the community, whether charging for tickets or offering free performances, but many new actors don’t find themselves comfortable with this venture. Getting together with other actors, regardless of level, who want to perform, rehearse, and improve, is important in the process. 

Again, you can call local community theaters for lists of people that may be interested in forming an acting group, or a repertoire, or you can log on to the Internet to find these groups that may already exist. There are more websites every week that connect people within their region to others who share their interest. Keep looking and contact these groups when you find them. Some may advertise professionalism, but this doesn’t necessarily mean high-quality actors, but more of a mindset. They will want people who are serious about acting and are willing to work on their craft to improve continuously.  
Watch the best performances If you’re into movies, then rent or purchase movies that won awards for performances, such as best actor, best actress, and best supporting roles. Watch the movies and study the performances of these actors who won the awards. Go out to see plays that have won awards as well. These may cost some money, but they are learning experiences. 

Ask you fellow local actors who the top actors within your region are and what performances they are taking part in, and then go and watch them act. 
Want To Take It Further? So, feeling inspired after watching some of those Academy Award winners? Feel pretty good about practicing the craft? Deciding to take a hobby into a profession, particularly acting, is serious business because the rate of success is very low. Every year, hundreds of hopeful people travel to Hollywood and New York, hoping to make it big, but almost all of them end up going back into obscurity. Ever watched “American Idol”? They search through thousands of people, to find one person to be the winner, and even then, only a couple of the winners have achieved stardom. Sometimes, dreams stay exactly that- dreams. 

Show business is exactly that- a business. While the ability to act may or may not be important, the thing that creates success is marketing. A hopeful actor needs to remember that even though they have succeeded in perfecting their range from the Lady Macbeth monologue to being able to rival the best improv troupe, talent isn’t everything. Flipping through a few television shows proves that. A great head shot, an impressive resume, a good agent, and having marketable skills are just as important. Don’t worry about that casting couch- a reputable agent does not use one. 

Speaking of agents- a reputable agent will never ask for money up front. If the agent who has approached you is asking for money- run in the other direction! 
Tips And Tricks Butterflies are normal! All actors experience them. Nervousness will get the adrenaline flowing and will help the actor be more alert and able to give a better performance. Use the nervousness; don’t try to block it out. 

Don’t break character while onstage! Everyone forgets their lines. However, if the actor does not break character, they will be able to recover and the audience will never notice. Try to keep the scene going and the other actors onstage will help get the scene back to where it is supposed to be. 
Tips For That Important Audition An actor would do well to always be prepared at audition. They should make sure they have the required material by studying the audition notice. Bring the required amount of audition material- don’t show up with one monologue if the notice asks for two. Match the material to the type play. For example, if auditioning for Equus, don’t prepare to audition with the “Springtime for Hitler” scene from The Producers. 

This may seem obvious, but actors should make sure they are right for the part being called for. Tyler Perry is not looking for a 5’2” blonde 30 year old woman to play Madea. Follow the guidelines and be as organized as possible. 

Be reliable. Show up at least ten or fifteen minutes early for audition. Don’t talk to everyone- spend the time waiting preparing for the audition. This will show the casting director that the actor is serious about getting the part. Also, bring a head shot and a resume, if one is available. 

Remember, an audition is a lot like a job interview, so behave accordingly. Don’t use profane language, don’t chew gum, and don’t talk too much. Dress nicely- business casual usually works well. By business casual, we mean slacks or a skirt and a nice shirt or blouse. If the part is for an easily recognizable character, such as Dracula- don’t come in dressed in a costume. It’s not a Halloween party- the actor is trying to put their best foot forward and the best way is not copying someone else’s look. The casting director will be more prone to be amused than to think the actor is trying to be serious. 

The actor should make certain that they are very familiar with their audition piece so that they are able to perform their lines instead of just speak them. This way, they can show the casting director the person in the play, not the person on stage. 

Don’t apologize or ask to try again. It is natural for an actor to immediately become his or her own worst critic. Keep these thoughts to yourself. Thank the casting director for their time and walk off stage. If they are right for the part, then the casting director will call. If not, then there are lots of other parts out there! 
Film Versus Stage Acting While most people in modern society are familiar with film actors, there is a major difference between acting for a camera and acting for the stage. On film, there is lighting, angles, and microphones that all come into play. Every nuance, facial gesture, or vocal inflection becomes magnified on film and is therefore important to focus on the minor details. 

On stage, projection, facing the audience, and body mannerisms are the focal energy of a performance. It is common in the performing arts that award-winning stage actors have trouble adjusting to film productions and that highly acclaimed film actors fall far short of their prowess when put on the stage. It is considered a more appropriate path for actors to study for the stage and then move to film than the other way around, but if your interest is in performing and not on fame or fortune, then it shouldn’t matter where you start. 

Being that film productions tend to be more expensive than stage productions, it is much easier to find small roles in local community theater than finding acting spots on television programs or commercials. 

The actor needs to be aware that camera acting and stage acting are two different things. Basically, stage acting is exaggerated and camera acting is just acting normal- normal tone of voice, normal movements and so on. Some obvious differences between film and stage acting need very little elaboration.   1. Volume: When acting on stage, the volume is all about projection. The actor must use correct diction and voice projection so that even people sitting in the last row in the balcony can hear them. Not so with camera acting. There is a microphone close by at all times, so the actor can just speak, so acting in front of a camera is basically normal. (Unless it’s a soap opera we’re talking about). 

2. Movement: When acting on stage, moving around is expected, but on camera moving around can mean walking off camera. The director will have the actor “hit their mark” and stay there so that the scene stays in frame. Notice how people in real life act when they are talking. Do they move their arms around or pace? No. Watch a few television shows and notice how sometimes the camera will cut to a “shoulder shot” when the actor is gesturing too much. On camera, an actor should restrict his or her movements to one per act. This way, the actor has to think about their movements and make them count so that they add to the story being told, not take away from it. 

3. Size: On stage, the actor’s face will rarely be seen close up. The on-stage actor will be required to use their bodies to communicate emotion. On camera, it can fill the whole frame, so that every movement, every twitch is seen. Camera acting calls for more subtlety than stage acting. For example, a surprising revelation on stage may include a loud gasp, the raising of the hands, a step back, the arching of the back to communicate to the audience- wow! That really took me off my feet! On camera, the same emotion can be communicated by raising the eyebrows and dropping the jaw. Don’t underestimate the power of the audience. If the actor has done their job properly, the audience is emotionally involved with the character. Listening to the main character’s beloved say- “I don’t want you anymore” will bring about an automatic reaction in the audience. The actor doesn’t have to overreact- the audience knows they are hurt- work with that empathy to create a great on-stage or on-camera performance. 
Conclusion Acting is a fantastic way for anyone to perform and entertain, whether it’s for their local community through community theater or even in the confines and comfort of their own home for family and friends, or stepping out onto the major stage or a television show or even a major motion picture. People from all walks of life, with any handicaps or limitations can act. 

Acting helps us to connect with one another in a way that is far different than conversation. Acting portrays ideas and good acting helps an audience to connect with a character and believe in his or her plight, to empathize and feel something for somebody else. While too many people in our modern society focus on acting as a million dollar, celebrity lifestyle and opportunity, most actors live and breathe within the comfort of local theaters. If you’re interested in acting, then you’re about to take your first steps into a greater world of wonder and entertainment. 
Frequently Asked Questions I have never taken any acting classes, but people tell me all the time I should act. Are they right? While no one can speak about your talents or abilities, acting is that one art form that is not relegated to the privileged few. If your friends or family members encourage you to pursue a life in acting, or even a hobby with acting, then you must ask yourself if it’s something that you enjoy. If not, then there’s no point in pursuing it. Regardless of innate talent or natural ability, if you don’t enjoy something, you won’t stick with it. 

Are there acting classes or courses that I can attend? Absolutely. Whether you’re interest in the cream of the crop, such as Julliard’s Performing Arts school in New York City, or local classes from your community college, there are plenty of opportunities to stretch your abilities and talents and learn from qualified teachers.   What kind of money can I expect to make from acting? Anywhere from none to millions. It all depends on your talent, skills, personal ambition, and sometimes a bit of luck. Most actors perform on community stages and have no desire to make any serious money. These actors are considered part-time or volunteer actors and only perform for the enjoyment it brings them. If you have higher ambitions, then it’s important to find a manager or representation firm to help you navigate the world of entertainment.",
Fishkeeping,"Fishkeeping Information  Introduction to Fishkeeping Throughout the world, one of the most popular hobbies is setting up aquariums to hold tropical fish. Unlike snakes and lizards that have a negative stigmas associated with them, fish have always been viewed as things of beauty. Perhaps the best thing about keeping fish is that they are relatively easy pets to keep, they are considerably cheaper than most pets, and there is an enormous quantity of different fish to choose from. Not only is there an endless supply of species, there are also many different fish from different types of bodies of water around the world. This article will touch on the most available and popular fish found in homes, that being fresh water fish from around the world, but we also have to talk a little bit about salt water fish as well. With such a large array of fish in the world, it is easy to run into problems by mixing various species of fish together with often disastrous results. The key to success with tropical fish, a lesson that is transferable to all pets, is that you can never do enough research about an animal. The more you know about something, the happier you and your new pet will be. What you will find truly interesting, is that the hobby has been around for centuries, and a little trip through history can teach us a great deal. 
Setting up your Aquarium The first thing you must have is an actual aquarium. Any pet store in North America will typically have a large supply of different shapes and sizes of aquariums. With so many to choose from, I always revert to the golden rule of purchasing an aquarium. Always choose the largest aquarium that you can physically fit in your home and that you can financially afford. There is no sense blowing your budget on a fancy 100 gallon bowed front aquarium that you can’t fit into your apartment, but the rule is to purchase a big tank because there is a higher level of error that is allowed in bigger fish tanks. For example, an ammonia spike in a 10 gallon fish aquarium will instantly kill everything, whereas the same spike in a 100 gallon tank won’t be notices at all. The size I generally prefer on a personal level is the 29 gallon tank because it is a decent size but not too big. Shape generally is not a bog concern, but you have to understand that most fish swim in the mid to low range of an aquarium, so tall tanks will generally be empty on the top half and lower tanks will look nice and full. The one thing that is often forgotten about fish is that they too have day and night cycles that require a light to be present on top of the aquarium. It’s something so simple, but if forgotten, can stress your fish out to the point of getting sick of actually dying. There are various lights that tend to mimic certain types of light. For the most part it is irrelevant to the fish as long as they have light, but if you plan of having live plants, then you will need to purchase a bright fluorescent that will aid in the plants’ growth. 

If there is anything more important than the aquarium itself, it would be the aquarium filter. There are numerous filters on the market right at any given time. There are many great filters, and there are probably twice as many terrible filters. People generally buy the terrible ones because they are dirt cheap, both financially and constructed cheap. There are two types of filters which are equally great for aquariums. Canister filters are the best by far because they circulate the aquarium water the most, hold the most filter media, and sit below the aquarium out of sight. The only issue with this kind is that they are more expensive, but they are generally used for larger aquariums. My favorite type of filter is the Hang on the Back filter that literally hangs on the back of your aquarium in order to filter the water. To ensure you have a good quality filter, you should always use filters that have separate filter media instead of the cheap models that have an all in one filter media. This will become more apparent when we talk about the nitrogen cycle and maintaining your aquarium. The different type of filter media are the sponge, which is a dense foam material that collects solid waste, charcoal, same thing that is in your Brita filter that removes odors and color, and Zeolite, which removes ammonia from the water. Other media can be used such as peat, which softens the water for some species of fish, and Biomax, which is a brand name porous material that grows beneficial bacteria. 

The last thing you have to do before you can set up your aquarium is decide what type of fish you are going to keep. For anything other than cold water fish, basically goldfish, you will have to purchase a heater. Since fish in pet stores are tropical, they require their water to be heated to approximately 75 to 80 Fahrenheit in order for the fish to have a proper metabolism and to ensure a stress free life. Just like filters, there are numerous good quality and cheap models available from pet stores and online that will do the job. I shouldn’t have to say it again, but never buy the cheap models. Always buy fully submersible filters because you can then mount them horizontally across the back of your aquarium to insure the tank gets heated evenly. The cheap model hangs on the back of your aquarium, and works fin, but it has a water level on it that must always stay in the water. Problems arise when water evaporated leaving the heated part of the heater exposed, which usually causes the heater to break and possibly electrocute you and the fish. Never cheap out when it comes to your pets! 
The Nitrogen Cycle The nitrogen cycle is a necessity to know if you plan on having success with the hobby of tropical water fish keeping. What it basically does, is show you how and why you have to do regular maintenance on you aquarium to ensure you always have top notch water quality. The basic idea is this: 

The second you add fish to the water, they eat and poop. Fish poop and uneaten food breaks down to cause ammonia to build up in your aquarium. To prevent the ammonia from killing your fish, nitrifying bacteria breaks the ammonia down into the less harmful nitrites. Since they too are dangerous if left unchecked, they too are broken down by nitrifying bacteria into the far less harmful nitrates. These of course are removes when you perform your 20% weekly water change. 
Types of Aquarium Fish Of the perhaps hundreds of thousands of fish throughout the world, there are thousands available for you own personal aquarium. There are many ways to break the thousands into groups, but without writing a series of encyclopedias, there is no way one can write about all the different types of freshwater, cold water, and marine fish available to the hobbyist. The main groups of fish that you may find in a pet store are the live bearers, which are a hearty fish that as the name implies gives birth to live young, schooling fish, basically the minnows of tropical fish species that always stick together in large groups, and cichlids, which are a large group of aggressive fish spanning multiple lakes throughout the world. Of course Marine Fish are more popular than they have ever been featuring brilliant colors and unique shapes and sizes. An unusual type of fish from fresh water lakes near the ocean is the Brackish water fish, which prefers about 50% of the salt as Marine aquariums. And of course no pet store would ever think of not selling the forever popular Cold water fish, the gold fish. 
Purchasing Your First Fish The first rule about purchasing your first fish is to buy a species that is interesting to you. Never be persuaded to purchase fish that you don’t want because you are told it is an easier fish species meant for a beginner. If it is a tropical fish that you don’t really want, then it is a pet that you will grow tired of in the future. Regardless of what type it is that you want, you have to ensure you do all the research about it prior to purchasing it so that you take proper care of the fish from day one. There is simply no sense in getting a freshwater fish that will grow to be 4 feet long that requires a swimming pool to live in. The idea that a fish will grow to the size of its enclosure is a myth, and the fact is that if they live in an enclosure too small their growth will be stunted and they will suffer from health issues. 

One of the most debated issues in fish keeping is whether to purchase from a private breeder or from a pet store. Here is an argument that is based on a few too many bad apples spoiling it for the bunch. Without pet stores, there simply would not be reptiles, snake, and fish in captivity as pets because it was various pet stores that sparked the interest in fish in the first place. But over the past twenty years, there have been numerous cases of poor quality fish being sold by people thinking only of profit as their fish suffer from neglect. Thankfully, there has been numerous enthusiasts stepping forward to challenge pet stores to live up to the higher standards people expect from pet stores, and there have also been numerous pet stores in North America that have been promoting proper care of fish species. Unlike reptiles where there is a downside to purchasing from a pet store because the pet store purchases from breeders and then mark up the prices to make a profit, the prices are generally so low that price is of no concern. Sometimes you will find unique fish in pet stores, but if you purchase from a breeder, you may be able to get a more unique morph that most people have never seen before plus the benefit of talking to someone with years of experience in the same hobby as you. 

As a general rule of thumb, always try to purchase the healthiest fish available. This is easily done by purchasing the largest in a group that has bright eyes and is active. Larger animals typically mean that they are being well fed and cared for. If a fish is skinny and not active, then it is best to leave it be. You also have to be concerned with fish diseases when purchasing fish. The most common are fish lice, which is a parasite that attaches itself to the fish similar to the way a tick attaches itself to other living things, fish fungus is a disease of the fins that has a fungus that eats away at the fish’s fins, and the most common of all is ich. Ich is a microscopic parasite that is always in water, but only attaches itself to a fish if they get stressed out and drops its protecting slime coat. This is easy to see because after ich is attached to the fish it has a protective white shell, so your fish basically gets tons of white spots. A healthy animal can live many years, and if you put in the time that is necessary, you will be rewarded in the long run. 

The other thing that is crucial to success in the hobby is ensuring you do not over stock your aquarium. As a general rule of thumb, you should only put one inch of fish in an aquarium for every gallon of water. So in theory, if you have a 10 gallon tank, you are able to stock it safely with 10 inches of fish. To add to this, you also have to think about the adult size of your fish. It may just be a one inch Oscar South American Cichlid now, but in awhile it is going to be a 10 inch Oscar South American Cichlid. If that is the case, you are allowed to have one Oscar in a ten gallon tank. Should you overstock your tank, you will eventually have a very high level of ammonia and nitrate that can cause all your fish to die. That is of course unless you want to do a water change every single day. 
Conclusion Setting up an aquarium to keep different species of fish is one of the easiest and most rewarding experiences you will ever do. Although the equipment to start can be on the pricey side when you factor in an aquarium, filtration, heating, lighting, and decorations, the fish themselves can be fairly inexpensive if you are planning on purchasing freshwater fish. Even Marine fish are considerably more inexpensive compared to ten years ago, but with marine fish, it is almost guaranteed that you will be getting a wild caught fish, where as freshwater fish are typically captive bred in aquariums. The only problem with keeping fish as a hobby is that it is very addicting because you can only have so many fish in your aquarium, but there are numerous amazing fish available at any given time. For this reason, it is not unusual for people to set up multiple aquariums to have the different types of fish that is of interest to them. It is just such a great hobby because it is just so accessible for people of all ages. But like all hobbies, it takes a lot of time, patience, and research, but eventually all your hard work will pay off.",
Golf,"Golf Information  Golf – an introduction Ask any golf player, and he or she will tell you that golf is a game that everyone ought to play. You may take action on this interest as a hobby and soon find that you want to play like a pro. The game of golf can be quite addictive and transform your weekends and holidays into fun-filled breaks. The rules are strict but simple and once you learn the basics and develop skills, it is practice that will take you ahead. When you step on that attractive expanse of green, you need to know which club to use and have the ability to hit the ball. Getting started with golf is not difficult and it depends on how much time you intend putting aside, and your budget. Whatever your goals, golf is a wonderful sport and a great pastime for men, women and children. It helps you stay fit. More important, you are out in that fresh air and you can opt to play individually or in groups. It also brings you new friends, enhancing your life socially. Even if it is challenging, sometimes annoying when you take time to master a shot, you will soon find that it is easy to get hooked to golf. 
Getting started Let’s begin with a quick recap of what you need to know. Golf is a game that is played on a private or public golf course with eighteen or nine holes. These courses are usually divided into the front nine holes and the back nine holes. 

Your aim would be to hit the golf ball into the hole with the minimum number of strokes, as you swing at the ball. You start by teeing off at the tee, progressing to the fairway and then the green. You are likely to find water, sand and foliage on the way. A scorecard keeps track of your scores. The player who has the least number of strokes at the end of eighteen holes is the winner of the game. Here’s a quick look at golf –related terminology you need to know as a beginner: 

o Each game of golf is called a round. 

o “Par” is the number of strokes any average player would play to reach the ball into the hole. 

o If you take the ball into the hole in one stroke less than par, it is called a birdie. 

o Two strokes less is an eagle 

o Three strokes less is a double eagle. 

o If you hit the ball in the hole with one stroke, it is a hole in one. 

o If you take the ball into the hole one-stroke over par, it is a bogey, 

o Two strokes over par is a double bogey. 

Golf is not a game that you can master overnight. Also, it can be an expensive hobby. But don’t spend a lot of money before you have practiced at least a little. As a beginner, it is best to be thrifty. While manufacturers such as Dunlop, Knight, Wilson, etc. are well known for their quality golf sets at around $150 or less, there are retailers such as Wal-Mart, K-Mart, etc. who sell bargain sets. 

It is also a good idea to check out garage or yard sales. Many professional golf players buy new sets every year so don’t be surprised if you actually end up with a great deal on a quality set. 
What you need to get started with golf To play, you need the following equipment to get started: 

o Golf clubs 

• This includes irons, woods and a putter. Woods can be numbered 1, 2, 3, up to 12. These are used to hit the ball to the farthest distance which could be about three hundred yards. 

• Irons are numbered one through nine and include a pitching wedge and sand wedge. Irons are used for making medium distance shots to up to 200 yards. 

• The putter is used to play on the green to tap the golf ball into the hole. 

o Golf balls 

o Optional - Golf shoes, gloves, umbrella, towel and cart. Golf has a strict set of rules governed by the US Golf Association (USGA) which includes scoring, penalties, etc. There is also a special set of rules called golf etiquette which you must become familiar with to avoid offending players on the course. Here’s a quick round-up of basic golf etiquette: 

Related to course maintenance: 

• Replace divots 

• Repair pitch marks 

• Rake sand bunkers 

• Do not put trolleys or bags on the green 

• Lay flag down gently 

• Follow paths   Courtesy to others: 

• Be still and quiet around players taking their shot 

• Do not obstruct other players 

• Let other players play through - don`t hold up other groups 

• Attend flag for partner if requested 

• Mark card off the green 
How to learn golf Ideally, it is best to get private lessons from a professional golf player or coach. If there’s a local golf course near where you live, this may not be difficult. Begin by setting up a lesson before you actually go out on the course since it can annoy regular players to see a beginner holding up their game! 

If you are not ready to spend a lot, yet want to get started soon, consider a golf academy. There are golf schools that have lodging packages for short term courses if you are prepared to travel. The best thing, of course, is weekly lessons with your local golf professional player whose charges vary according to the course they are affiliated with and time available with them. You may be able to get golf sessions for under $30 per lesson that could last thirty minutes to an hour. You can learn the fundamentals of golf from books and watch instructional videos. Visit your local library and bookstore for books and videos related to golf. You will find books about the top players, the history of the game, etc. in the sports section. Try and find books that have plenty of illustrations and photos since that will show you how the game, the players, the skills and stance look, making it easier to understand. You can learn the finer points of intricate moves like the swing, various drills that you can practice on your own at a driving range or even in your own backyard. 

Golf videos are a wonderful way to learn as these are often made around professional golfers or well known coaches. 

The internet has plenty of information and instruction, including tips on playing golf. Sign up with forums and discussion boards and browse the coach’s pages for how to articles. Most of these sites are full of useful information and guides that will help improve your game. It can also be fun interacting with others who are learning the game just like you. 
Practice is the key Ultimately, it is practice that will actually help you become proficient. So you have to get out there to a golf course or driving range and practice your swings. The more your practice, the better you will get. Here are some basic tips you must remember when you practice: 

• Set yourself a target. You already know that your aim is to take the golf ball as close to the hole as you can, but that doesn’t mean just swinging and hoping it happens. You have to find the target first by gauging the distance from you to the hole. You then need to find a mark ahead of the ball in line with your target and then swing to hit the ball. 

• After you plan your swing, grip your golf club and practice a few swings. Ensure that your grip is comfortable so that your arms easily swing. Your dominant hand must be directly below the other hand. 

• Your stance is the next thing. Stand just under arms length from the tee, face the ball and your target with your feet together. Then, shift your feet a little so that your left foot is just ahead of your right foot and about shoulder width apart. 

• Now, it is time to swing. Start by taking the club forward and ahead of the ball. Then pull it back until it is parallel to the ground. As you swing, the club must track the same path. Your swing must be one complete flowing movement without pause. When you swing, your head should be down, watching your club strike the ball. After you hit the ball, continue to swing till the club hits your back as you raise your head and watch where the ball goes. 

After you have practiced the above a few times, apply all the tips you have learned from your coach, the books and videos and keep practicing. 

Where can you practice? 

You can practice at the driving range where there are practice putting greens. Here, you can hit as many balls as you want. Some ranges have practice chipping areas and sand bunkers. 

Alternately, you can also practice your swing in your backyard with waffle golf balls. Your living room is a good place for putting practice. Once you are ready to play, par 3 courses are ideal for beginners. These have nine holes as short par 3s. There are executive courses that are shorter than the regular eighteen-hole courses. If you feel like trying the 18-hole courses, choose one that is not too long and is easy, without too much sand and water. 
Beginners’ tips The game of golf needs a lot of concentration and patience if you want to be a good player. While studying the techniques used by pros, you need to find the one that works best for you. Thus, develop your own skills and work hard. Here are some tips that will help you become better at the game:   • You will find that golf lets you use your entire body, including your feet, hips, torso and arms to execute your golf swing. You also need to develop the right stance for your shot. Thus, practice your posture and keep your head up, with your knees bent and arms relaxed to make your swing a smooth and fluid movement. 

• Take care to watch your grip. If you hold your club very tight or too loose, it can affect your drive and your swing. Rather than use your palms, use your fingers. 

• What you need to realize is the game of golf does not entirely depend on your personal skills. There are other factors like the direction and speed of the wind, the grass and the moisture in the atmosphere. You need to observe and get familiar with the course to get ahead in the game. Combining your skills and the other factors will enable you improve your game. 

• As with any sport, you need to find time to practice on a regular basis. When you practice consistently, it helps you develop muscle memory and pace your energy in the right manner. For beginners, especially, it is best to play in a practice course or driving range. Even if you begin playing the game, it is important to continue to practice and work on your swing. This will help improve your swing through frequent practice. 

• In addition to your swing, you should also practice to improve your drive and putt as this will take you from being an amateur player to a pro. 
Conclusion The vital thing about any hobby is enjoying it and having fun and golf is no different. Amid all the hard work, don’t forget to enjoy yourself in the process. It can be easy to get frustrated sometimes and difficult to grasp a technique. Be patient and persistent and before you know it, you will be well on your way to being an accomplished golf player.",
Motorcycle - Touring,"Introduction to General MotorcyclingThe open road calls to you. The roar of an engine piques your interest and as it approaches, you already know what it is. The V-twin engine rumbles the ground around your feet and you watch the two wheel beast cruise on by. The feeling of freedom that motorcycle riding offers people is unmatched in today’s world of metal boxes all squeezing down the road just to reach a destination.A motorcycle ride isn’t about getting somewhere. It’s about the ride; it’s about the experience. Imagine sitting on a machine, cruising down the winding road, feeling the dips and curves, hugging the road as the wind blows past your body, as the sound of thunder roars beneath you, and all of your cares and concerns float away.That’s the experience of riding a motorcycle. Yet there is so much misinformation about motorcycle riding that is being spread through the media, through frustrated neighbors, and in entertainment that some believe that riding a motorcycle will mean that their life expectancy will be shortened, or that they must fit a certain stereotype in order to even think about it.The truth is that a motorcycle rider is much more exposed on the motorcycle than a person is in a car. Should a motorcycle be involved in an accident, then the risk of injury and death will certainly increase. But there are precautions that one can take that will greatly reduce these risks.Also, riding a big Harley or a sports bike doesn’t mean that one has to be a large bearded and tattooed gang member, or a young kid who believes he is invincible. Motorcycle riders come in all shapes and sizes, from every demographic and socioeconomic class. Stock traders and doctors join the ranks of riders everywhere, especially on the weekends. These weekend ‘warriors’ leave behind the troubles of the week, of family, and of bills, whenever the straddle the engine and roll on out of the driveway.America, the birthplace of the motorcycle, is the home of freedom and that is never more meaningful than when traveling down the road on a motorcycle. Learning to ride can be frightening at first, but it can also be the most rewarding experience one could imagine. Hopping on the bike on the spur of the moment to simply get away for an hour or two offers something that a car, not even a convertible, can.For those who have never experienced the thrill of motorcycle riding, they simply don’t know what they’re missing. For those who have, then they know quite well. Types of Motorcycles There are generally three types of motorcycles to choose from. The first is the street bike. These include cruisers, sports bikes, mopeds, and scooters. While mopeds and scooters are often not generally categorized as motorcycles, many state and countries have the same license requirements for them as they have for motorcycles.There are also some significant restrictions placed on mopeds and scooters, such as not being permitted on highways and interstates, for example, due to the size of the engine and their limited mobility and power.Off-road motorcycles include dirt racing bikes, also known as motocross, and in most states, these bikes are not considered legal for road use. Some states do permit these bikes on the road, however, as long as they have proper lighting and engine size. The latter of these are known as dual-purpose bikes.Each motorcycle type requires the rider to exhibit and use different sets up skills, hold a different posture, and treat the conditions differently. How to Learn to Ride a Motorcycle There are many mistakes that people make when learning how to ride a motorcycle. For anyone who has ever ridden a bicycle, it may seem as though it’s quite simple, actually. The truth is that the fundamentals of riding a motorcycle, such as balance and turning, may be the same as used while riding a bicycle, the two are quite different.The first thing to keep in mind when learning how to ride a motorcycle is that you will be riding with traffic. In other words, when riding a bicycle, you keep to the right and cars will be expected to pass on the left when it’s safe to do so. Also, as a bicyclist, you would have the right-of-way over a car. However, when riding a motorcycle, you will travel just as a car would and give the right-of-way to pedestrians and bicyclists, as you would if you were in a car.That makes learning to ride a motorcycle important to be done in a safe location, away from traffic and out of the danger zones of the open road. First Steps As with learning any new activity, there will be some level of discomfort as you take your first steps. It is highly recommended that you attend a motorcycle riding safety course, such as MSF, before getting on a bike for the first time. These courses take beginner riders through the fundamentals of riding from the very beginning –from understanding the controls to operating the clutch and the throttle. These courses are not designed for any specific age group but are ideal for all ages, as well as highly recommended.Learning to ride a motorcycle is easiest with a smaller bike to begin. A ‘250’ size engine, or even a ‘500’ size is ideal for most people. These motorcycles are generally smaller, lower to the ground, and weigh a lot less than their major brothers and sisters of the street bike brand. By starting out on a small bike, it makes balancing and controlling the bike much easier.A more powerful bike is less forgiving in the throttle and the clutch, which means that an inexperienced rider can find themselves in trouble as soon as they release the brake, give the throttle a slight turn, and release the clutch.If you don’t have access to a smaller bike, the rider safety courses that are available throughout the country will be a safer start. Follow the Law Most states, and countries, require a motorcycle rider to have a permit before they can even think about heading out onto the open road. Depending on the location of the rider, the permit may require them to be followed by a licensed, experienced motorcycle rider traveling in a car. The reason for this is that should something go wrong, or should the novice rider find themselves in a difficult situation, the experienced rider can take over.Most permits require the individual to take a written test. This test will encompass the rules of the road as well as the rules and maneuvering strategies that a motorcyclist should follow while in traffic and real-world situations. By studying the manual that most DMV departments supply for studying for this test, a novice rider will learn a great deal that they can apply when first straddling the bike. Don’t Rush and Don’t Be Pressured It can be easy to feel rushed when learning to ride a motorcycle, especially when friends are impatiently waiting for you to join them on the open road. However, the most important thing to keep in mind is safety. Do not, for any reason, allow yourself to be pressured into leaving the comfort or the safety of an isolated training ground, such as an empty parking lot.People who head out onto the road before they feel comfortable are much more likely to become involved in an accident. In those cases, it would be an accident that was avoidable. For some people, it takes months of practice before they are ready to head out into the wild jungle of traffic. However long it takes is what you should require of yourself. Tips and Tricks By stating ‘tricks’, this doesn’t mean popping wheelies or jumping over cars. Instead, tricks mean methods that can keep you safe when riding.When first learning to ride a motorcycle, it’s important to understand its weight. Sit on the bike while it is parked on a level surface, and not running. Have a friend straddle the front wheel and hold the handlebars. Lean the bike to one side, feeling the weight and then bring it back upright. Do the same on the other side.The friend is only there to ensure that the bike doesn’t tip over onto the ground. This exercise will help you understand how it feels when it begins to lean to far to one side when stopped. Many people lose their balance once they come to a stop because they are gripping the brake too hard and stopping too short. This will help you avoid that fate. Use Your FeetWhen learning to ride, it’s perfectly acceptable to allow your feet to help balance the bike when starting off from a stopped position. Don’t allow the feet to drag, but rather keep them out to the sides or slightly ahead of your forward position. When you feel the bike rolling and balancing with momentum, then get your feet up.Do not, for any reason, use this technique when coming to a stop. The foot can get caught and dragged back under the muffler of foot pegs, causing serious injury. Feather the Rear BrakeWhen taking slow, tight turns, you want to make sure that you use the friction zone of the clutch to control your speed. Using the rear brake while using the throttle and clutch control can help maintain balance on the bike. Since the power of the bike comes from the rear wheel, adding the brake at the same will cause two opposing forces to fight against one another and the bike will want to be upright. Frequently Asked Questions for All Motorcycles What about safety? What kind of equipment should I use?Safety when riding a motorcycle should always come first. There are many states that don’t require helmets when riding a motorcycle, but this is not recommended, even if the law allows it. Wearing a helmet should be a must for all motorcycle riders. A full-face helmet is also recommended, since 64% of serious head injuries occur to the part of the head and face that half-helmets don’t cover.A thick leather riding jacket, and chaps, go a long way to protecting a rider in the event of a crash. Gloves are a must as they shield the hands from flying debris on the road. Where can I learn? Do I need a bike to learn?Most rider safety courses supply the motorcycle for you. There is likely a rider safety course in your area. It is highly recommended that you take part in one of these course before heading out on the road for the first time on your own motorcycle. General Motorcycle Conclusion Riding a motorcycle does something to the spirit. It unleashes stress and rejuvenates the soul. There are inherent risks in riding a motorcycle that are different than riding in a car. However, many of those risks can be controlled through proper training and conscientiousness.Having the right safety equipment, taking a rider safety course, and not being pressured into heading out into traffic until you are comfortable and ready are some of the steps one can take to increase the odds that they will have a long and healthy riding life.",
Cigar Smoking and Rolling,"Cigar Smoking and Rolling Information  Introduction There is a long history of cigar smoking around the world. Traditionally associated with wealth and power, cigars have come and gone in favor over the years. Currently cigar rolling and cigar smoking is very much in style with both men and women rolling cigars for their own consumption and having cigar tasting parties and gatherings. Cigar bars are very popular in major metropolitan areas and allow customers to try cigars from around the world. 

Cigars have also been used traditionally for a variety of celebrations. This is likely due to their relatively high cost and scarcity throughout history. Cigars are used to celebrate the birth of a child, at a wedding or a major accomplishment or a graduation. In addition cigars are also associated with fine dining, wealth and social status. Although very traditionally only enjoyed by men, the modern hobby of cigar smoking and cigar making is enjoyed by men and women alike. 

Small and large cigar making companies now import and export all over the world, although the United States still has a ban on cigars from Cuba. Many cigars are made completely by hand and cigars can range in price from just a few dollars each right through the incredible cost of $750 per cigar. The world`s most expensive cigar is Gurkha`s His Majesty`s Reserve, and is dipped in Louis XIII Cognac, one of the rarest and best cognac`s available. There are only a maximum of 100 boxes of these cigars produced per year, leading to an incredible demand for these very unusual cigars. 

While you may not be interested in producing the most expensive cigar, rolling your own cigars is a true art and skill. It takes many years of practice to learn to bundle the filler and wrap the cigar so it is uniform, has a good flavor throughout and burns evenly and clean. If you can find an experienced cigar roller to mentor or study under it is highly recommended, however you can also practice on your own to develop the skills necessary to produce a great cigar. 
Equipment and Supplies The equipment required for the making of cigars is relatively inexpensive and easily available through cigar shops and tobacco retailers. The most important supplies are the types of tobacco themselves since these will form the taste of the cigars. Poor quality tobacco leaves will result in poor quality cigars, regardless of the skill of the roller. 

Clean linen or cotton towels and a spritz bottle filled with distilled water will be essential to keep the tobacco leaves, particularly the wrappers, soft and pliable until use. Use only distilled water in the spray bottle and mist but don`t soak the towels around the leaves prior to use. 

In addition to the tobacco leaves for the filler, binder leaves, which hold the filler in place, are also important. These leaves have to be slightly more elastic to provide the tight hold between the filler and the final wrapper. The wrapper, the external layer of the cigar, is the most important and needs to be free from any tears or holes but also a very high quality tobacco. In most cigars the wrapper provides almost as much of the flavor of the cigar as the filler, so choosing a good taste match with the interior filler is essential. 

A cutter, which is similar to a tube shaped paper cutter, provides a very quick and precise way to create the foot of the cigar. You can use a very sharp knife but this can lead to pressing down or squeezing the end of the cigar, resulting in poor lighting and burning. A simple cutter is highly recommended with the blade maintained in top condition and sharpness for the most effective and clean cut possible. 

Molds can be used to help to shape the cigars after rolling. These molds also help to compact the filler slightly, but it is the consistency of the rolling that is critical. Molds can hold larger or smaller numbers of cigars. If you don`t want to use a mold you can use a simple drying rack. It is important to allow the cigars to dry since they will be moist after rolling. If you don`t allow them to air dry they can begin to grow bacteria and actually spoil. In very humid climates or during the most humid months you may need to dry the cigars in the oven on a very low, just barely warm temperature to provide the curing time. Most cigars will be in the mold or the drying rack for up to a week depending on the humidity in the air and the ambient temperature. 
Cigar Smoking Cigar smoking is considered a well honored practice and has a routine involved in the enjoyment of the cigar. This starts with the smoker rolling the cigar under the nose and inhaling the smell of the tobacco. He or she is also testing for consistency through the cigar to provide for an even burn. 

After rolling the cigar gently and inhaling the scent, the cigar is then cut. Typically most cigars will come with one end blunt cut and the other end left wrapped in a cap, which protects the curved end. The cut is made above the top of the cap and needs to be straight and clean without dragging on the interior filler leaves. It is important to realize with hand rolled cigars that more than one filler can be used to give different flavors and strengths of tobacco as the cigar is smoked. This is always designed with the intent to be smoked from the flat cut end to the capped end, so having the cigar in the right orientation is essential to get the full effect. 

Lighting is also a tradition. The foot, or the blunt cut part of the cigar, also the end farthest from the band, is light slowly and with an even flame. The cigar can be rolled either clockwise or counterclockwise to ensure the entire end is uniformly lit and provides an even burn. It is essential to avoid using any type of lighter other than butane since they can actually cause a taste to the tobacco. Wooden matches that are not treated with sulfur are another option but paper matches should be avoided because they do have chemicals that will alter the taste. Small, thin strips of cedar are often included in cigar tubes for lighting purposes. Any type of lighter can be used to ignite the cedar strip, then this is used to light the cigar. There is no transfer of chemicals or odors, making a perfect option that adds to the routine. 

Smoking a cigar is much different than smoking a cigarette. The smoke is not taken deep into the lungs; rather it is held in the mouth and exhaled partially through the nose and mouth to allow the full flavor of the tobacco to develop. It is important to realize that, like cigarette smoke, there is a risk of cancer in smoking cigars even without inhalation. Because of the type of processing of the tobacco leaves there is actually more nicotine absorbed by the body in cigar smoking as compared to smoking cigarettes. 

Finally the humidity at which the cigar is stored will have a great impact ton the taste and flavor as well as the clean burn of the cigar. Ideally the cigars should be stored in a humidor at about 64 degrees and 68-74 percent humidity. Home humidors are available at most cigar stores and are also available online that maintain just the correct humidity level. Humidors have to be filled only with distilled water or propylene glycol, depending on the model, and need to be cleaned regularly to prevent bacteria build-up. Typically the humidifiers within the humidors should be replaced every two to four years to prevent any possibility of bacteria developing on the cigars. If you make your own cigars a humidor will be essential after the initial curing period. Dry cigars burn very quickly and produce a very bitter taste. Wet cigars burn unevenly or not at all and the smoldering of the filler produces an acid like taste that is very distinct and unpleasant. 
Conclusion Cigar smoking and cigar rolling are hobbies that are enjoyed around the world by a wide range of both men and women. Rolling cigars takes time, practice and patience as well as a eye for detail and an willingness to learn time honored techniques. However, once mastered, those that know how to roll cigars correctly can produce a very high quality smoke at far less than the cost of buying cigars. Having the correct storage equipment both for the raw tobacco as well as for the finished cigars is perhaps the greatest cost, but with careful maintenance this equipment will last a significant amount of time. 

Cigar smoking, like all types of tobacco use, does have significant health risks. Understanding these risks is important before deciding if this is a hobby you wish to pursue. Smoking cigars only in designated smoking areas or within your own home or property is also critical as many cities and urban areas now have strict regulations on tobacco use on public property. 

Getting involved in a cigar club or in a social group that enjoys cigars, cigar rolling or cigar tasting can be a wonderful way to gain both experience and general knowledge. There are online groups and in person groups that meet, taste and evaluate cigars and provide ratings and rankings for the various cigar types. Becoming either a cigar producer at these events or as a tasting judge is a perfect way to expand your understanding of cigars and cigar production. Working with someone in the organization that has a lot of experience with cigars is a very good option when you are just starting out.",
Beer Brewing,"Beer Brewing Information  Introduction – Why Brew Beer? Brewing your own beer is by no means a new hobby, but more of a lost art. To put this in perspective, consider that George Washington is often credited for inventing Porter, and it is quite well documented that he enjoyed his share of what we’d now consider microbrews. In the 1920’s, though, the United States went through prohibition and took a giant leap backwards in respect to small breweries. The few large breweries that survived dominated the market with a mass produced product that was to previous beers what plain white bread was to traditional bakeries. In 1979 President Carter signed the law that once again allowed home brewing, though there are still restrictions, especially at the state level. (Perhaps he was making up for his brother’s “Billy Beer?”) In any case, home brewing has been a thriving and growing hobby for over thirty years. 

But why would you want to brew your own beer? Thirty years ago, if you wanted anything other than an American lager, you’d pretty much have to go with an import, often stale and overpriced. But with the advent of micro breweries, you can find some amazing quality beers that are often made locally. As far as cost, once you’ve collected the basic equipment, the cost of brewing any given beer is about the same as buying an equivalent microbrew. 

So why would you put hours of work into making your own beer if you’re not saving money or getting better beer then you can buy? It’s a matter of personal pride, being able to say “I brew the beer I drink.” Or perhaps it’s the ability to experiment--“what does x taste like?” And frankly, it’s just plain fun. Another advantage is that most home brew is “live ale”, i.e., it contains active yeast. Live ales are still very hard to find, even in microbrews, and many people consider them significantly better than other beers. 
How it Works The basic process of home brewing isn’t much different from commercial brewing. Wort is produced by combining malt and hops. Then yeast is added and the wort ferments into beer. Advanced home brewers use techniques almost identical to commercial breweries, while basic home brewers use short cuts to simplify the process. 
Malts and Mashing Most home brewers get started using malt extract and partial mashes. Full mash (or all grain) brewing requires additional time and equipment, though the results are worth it. 

To explain extracts and mashes, we need to understand what malt really is. If you take a grain like barley, grind it up, put it in water, and then add yeast, you’ll eventually get rotten water. The yeast cannot live off the starch in the grain seeds. When grain is soaked for a short time in water, however, it begins to grow, releasing enzymes that convert the starches in the grain into sugars that the plant can use to grow. Once the grain starts to sprout, it’s dried out again, but its enzymes remain intact. This is malted grain. 

The next step is to extract the enzymes and sugars from the malted grain. The grain is ground and added to water and then held at a certain temperature for about an hour so. This allows the enzymes to do their work, and the sugars can be extracted. This process is called mashing. 

Once the mash is done, the grain is rinsed and the fermentable sugars and water form the basis of the wort. This is the stage where the water is extracted and malt extract is produced for basic home brewers. It’s also the stuff you add to chocolate and milk for malts! In partial mash brewing, most of the fermentables come from malt extract, but some specialty grains (i.e., malted grains) are mashed and added to the wort, primarily for flavoring. 
The Boil In any case, the malt and water mixture is then boiled, typically for an hour. Hops are added both early in the boil and near the end of the boil. The hops that are added early on are known as bittering hops. 

Bittering hops help preserve the beer and add the bitter taste. Near the end of the boil, aromatic hops are added to affect the taste and smell of the beer. 
Fermenting The wort produced in the boil is then cooled and yeast is added. The actual fermentation takes typically one to two weeks. The beer is then transferred to bottles or other containers. Most home brews are kept live; that is, they contain active yeast that naturally carbonates the beer, while most commercial breweries filter out the yeast and are artificially carbonate. 
Basic Home Brewing The first thing you should do is make a trip to your local home brewing store. Just check the yellow pages under home brewing or wine making supplies. If there isn’t a local shop, there are a number of internet brewing supply stores that will be happy to help – many of them have helpful information on their web sites and most will be happy to work with you over the phone. Midwest Brewing Supply even sends you a DVD with your order! Most brewing supply stores will have pre-configured equipment kits with everything you need to get started as well as recipe kits that contain all the instructions and ingredients you’ll need to make one batch of beer. Some stores even allow you to brew on premises, using their equipment. This can be an informative, no-mess way to begin your hobby. 
Basic Equipment Various stores include differing equipment in their kits, and you may need to borrow certain items. This is a list of the most essential items you will need for your first batch of beer: • Brew pot – A 4-gallon or larger pot of some kind, stainless is preferred. • Something to stir with – Keep in mind the size of your brew pot. • Fermenter – Usually a 6.5 gallon plastic bucket with a tight sealing lid that is cut to make room for an air lock. Get this from the home brew store – it needs to be food grade and cannot be scratched. Some of them have built-in spigots – they’re fine. Having a couple of these, or one of these plus a carboy, will help out greatly. • An airlock and stop – Again, get these from the home brew store and make sure they fit your fermenter. • Thermometer – the home brew store will carry adhesive thermometers that attach to the side of your fermenter. They are inexpensive and very handy. • Siphon, siphon tubing, and a shutoff clamp – There are multiple styles of siphons. If you’re using a fermenter with a spigot, you may just need the tube. • Bottles – You can clean and reuse any empty “pop off” beer bottles, or you can buy them at the store. Often you can get larger bottles at the store, or get flip top bottles (like Grolsch). Keep in mind you cannot use twist off bottles. • Bottle caps – these often come with the ingredient kit. • Capper – unless you’re using alternate bottles, or kegging (not recommended for your first batch) you’ll need a capper. 
Other Supplies • Strainer or grain/hop bags – You’ll need these if you’re doing more than the most basic brewing. • No-rinse sanitizer – Some books and web sites mention diluted bleach solutions; do yourself a favor and get some Star San or Easy Clean No-Rinse. • PBW or P-Bright for cleaning. • Bottle brush/Carboy brush. • Glass carboy with stopper and air lock – Most people prefer using these over the plastic buckets, especially for advanced brewing. • Hydrometer – You’ll need this if you want to determine the alcohol content or do any advanced brewing. • Funnel – 8” or so. 
Step by Step Instructions Most ingredient kits come with their own instructions specific to the type of beer and the actual ingredients in that kit. 

Step 1 – Check the Ingredients Make sure you have everything you need. Once you start brewing you can’t just stop and pick it up the next day. 

Step 2 – Clean and Sanitize The goal if cleaning is pretty simple; it gets all your equipment as clean as possible. There are two very important differences on how to clean, though. First, don’t use soap. Soap tends to leave a film that can ruin the head on your beer. Your home brew store should stock special cleaners, probably PBW or P-Brite. Second, don’t use abrasive pads. Abrasive pads, or any abrasive, can leave scratches that can hold bacteria. This is especially true when using plastic bucket fermenters. Everything that the wort (the unfermented beer) is going to touch needs to be sanitized. The best and simplest method is to use no-rinse sanitizers, such as Start San or One-Step. To use these, you simply mix them with water (the amount will be indicated), then soak all your small parts/equipment and liberally apply the mixture to everything else. If you are using a plastic brew bucket for a fermenter, you can have a spare bucket on hand and fill the one you’ll be using with the sanitizer mixture and soak all your small equipment it. When you are ready to move the wort to the fermenter, just move the equipment to the second bucket and pour the sanitizer in afterwards. Keep in mind, “no-rinse” means exactly that, the ingredients in these sanitizers will not affect your beer. The equipment should still be wet with sanitizer when you use it. 

Step 3 – Steeping the Grain Many ingredient kits include crushed grains that need to be steeped in water to extract the malt. The most basic kits tend to have the specialty grains already processed into the malt extract, so just ignore this step if it doesn’t apply. Hopefully the grain was crushed at the store. If not, you can use a rolling pin to crush the grain before steeping. Add the crushed grains into the grain bag, then put the grain bag, along with about 2 gallons of water into your brew pot. Bring the temperature to about 160°F for about 30 minutes. Use a candy thermometer if you have one; otherwise watch for steam without a boil. Remove from heat and let the grain steep for another 10 minutes or so while it cools. Then remove the grain bag. Dump out the grains; depending on the type of bag you may be able to rinse and reuse it. 

Step 4 - The Boil At this point, you are ready to add the malt extract. This can be either a powder or a thick liquid. Simply add it to the water and stir. Try to get it to mix fully with the water before you put it back on the burner. At this point, turn the heat up and bring the mixture to a boil. At some point during the boil, the brew pot is likely to boil over. This is a pain to clean up and it effectively dilutes your beer, so keep a close eye on the brew pot and be ready to turn down the heat and stir. As soon as the mixture starts to boil, you should add your bittering hops, preferably in a hops bag (or hops sock). These hops, as the name indicates, are what gives the beer its bitterness and helps to preserve it. Mark the time or start a timer, then keep stirring and watching the pot. You will boil the mixture for one hour, and near the end you’ll need to add the aromatic hops. The timing of adding the aromatic hops depends on the type of beer and the type of hop. Some types of beer require that different aromatic hops be added at different times during the boil. Generally, aromatic hops are added about 50 minutes into the boil, or about 10 minutes before the end. Your kit should have specific instructions. Note – the pot will almost always boil high shortly after adding the aromatics. Watch for this, too! 

Step 5 – Cooling and Aerating the Wort First of all, congratulations – you now have wort! Wort (pronounced “wert”) is the product that is physically fermented into beer. All equipment used from this point forward should be sanitized. 

First though, you need to get it your pot cooled off as fast as feasible. The longer the brew stays warm the more likely it is to get contaminated. The best choice is to use a wort cooler, but it’s not generally something you’ll have for your first batch. The simplest method is to set your brew pot in a sink full of cold water or ice. If your brew pot has a top, keep it on except while stirring. Stir with a sanitized spoon every 15 minutes. You can also use ice as part of your top off water (in the next step). The goal here is to get the temperature of the wort under 80°F. 

Once the wort is cool enough, transfer it into the primary fermenter and top it off with enough water (or ice) to bring up to 5 gallons. If you’re not using bags for your grains or hops, you’ll want to use the strainer at this point. After the wort from the brew pot has been strained, run your top of water through the strainer containing the grains and/or hops. This process is called sparging and will help collect and keep fermentables from sticking to the solids. Finally, you need to aerate the wort. You can do this by stirring, pouring back and forth between sanitized containers. The yeast needs oxygen to grow and ferment. If you have a hydrometer, this is the time to get your “original” reading. 

Step 6 – Pitch the Yeast Your kit may have come with dry or liquid yeast, but in any case there should be directions on the yeast packet (or tube, or pouch). Follow the directions that come with the yeast and add it to the cooled wort as soon as possible (recheck your temperature first). Seal your fermenter with the sanitized airlock (you’ll need to add a bit of water to your airlock, by the way). Talk to your home brew store about how to use the type you have. Then store your fermenter in a cool, dark area, preferably 60-70°F. 

Within two or three days, your airlock should be bubbling, and the wort should be covered with foam. Depending on the instructions and the type of beer, you may want to transfer to a secondary fermenter after the first few days. For a basic first batch, just leaving it in for two weeks is a safe rule of thumb. 

Step 7 – Bottling You should preferably have a second brew bucket or other container available to transfer the beer to before bottling. Start by sanitizing the bottling bucket, tubing, siphon, and all your bottles and caps. If you’re using standard 12-oz. bottles you’ll need about 2-½ cases (54 bottles) for one batch of beer. If your dishwasher has a sanitize cycle or a heated dry cycle you can use that--just don’t use soap or sanitizer in the dishwasher. Everything else should be sanitized with no-rinse sanitizer. 

Next you’ll need the primer – boil one cup of water and ¾ cup of corn sugar (which should be part of your ingredients) for about 5 minutes, then add this to you sanitized bottling bucket. This sugar will cause the beer to ferment just a little bit more, which will provide the carbonation and the head of the beer. Siphon the beer from your fermenter to the bottling bucket, letting it mix with the primer. 

Now siphon the beer from the bottling bucket and fill each bottle, don’t overfill. Leave at least an inch of air at the top of each bottle. There are various methods to transfer the beer--siphoning, a spigot at the bottom of the bottling bucket, or specialized bottle fillers, but in most cases you’ll have plastic tubing going into the bottle. Try to get the tubing near the bottom of the bottle, fill from the bottom not the neck. Also, use a tubing clamp near the bottle end of the tube to minimize lost beer and cleanup. This is also a good time to grab another hydrometer reading. Comparing this to the original (and following a formula based on the type of hydrometer you have) will give you the alcohol content. 

Finally – cap the bottles and store your beer – once again in a cool dark place, 60–70°F is optimal. Then wait patiently for about two weeks for most basic beers. 

And that’s it! Enjoy your beer! 
More Info
Ingredients and terms Malt Malt is made from grains such as barley, wheat, rye, oats, and sorghum that have been soaked in water, germinated, and kilned (dried). The process releases enzymes that will release the sugars to be extracted during the mash. Common malts include 2-row, 6-row, caramel, crystal, Munich, chocolate, and black patent. Malts can be named after their grain, their origin, or their appearance and taste. The type of malt in a beer affects both its flavor and its color. Not surprisingly, the color of the malt is reflected in the color of the beer. Darker beers are made with a darker roast of malt, which affects the flavor but not the alcohol content of the beer. Beers made with large amount of light malts will be light in color but high in alcohol content. 

Malt Extract 

Malt extract is made by drawing the sugar solution off of malted barley, pasteurized and dehydrated in vacuum chambers to minimize carmelization. Hop extract is often added to this, as well. Malt extract is commonly sold by color (light, amber, or dark) and as Dry Malt Extract (DME) or Liquid Malt Extract (LME). Many basic brewing kits consist of pre-hopped LME. 

Hops 

Nothing to do with rabbits, hops are a perennial climbing vine that can be grown pretty much anywhere. The ripe female flower is the only part used. If the flower is fertilized, it will produce seeds which reduce the bittering effect of the hops. There are over one hundred varieties of hops being cultivated, including Cascade, Centennial, Cluster, Fuggles, Galena, Goldings, Hallertauer, Kent, Nugget, Northern Brewer, Saaz, and Willamette. Each type of hop has its own characteristics and can produce markedly different tasting beers. Hops have been used in beer since ancient Egypt (7000-1000 BC) and were cultivated in Germany as early as 300 AD. It was only since the Middle Ages, though, that hops became the dominant bittering agent in beer. Prior to that, horehound, dandelion, and numerous other herbs and flowers were used to offset the sweetness of the malt in beer. It is likely that the switch to hops was a due to a combination of the flavors and aromas when added later in the brewing process, the preservative effect, and the resistance to bacterial infections that cause souring. 

Bittering hops are added early in the boil of the beer, and the amount and type of hops determines the bitterness. The alpha acids contained in hops are responsible for both the bitterness and the preservative properties of the hops. 

Aromatic hops are added to near the end of the boil and contribute to both the smell and the ‘hoppy’ flavor. Dry hopped beer uses hops that are added after the beer has been fermented. 

Most American lagers have little, if any, hop flavor, while India Pale Ales (IPAs) are known for their high bitterness and hoppy flavor. IPAs were originally brewed for shipment from England to India, and the higher levels of bitterness aided in the preservation of the beer during the trip. The home brewer can generally find hops in loose or pellet form. Loose hops are the unprocessed hop petals, while pellets are compacted for easier shipping. 

Yeast Yes, it’s a variety of the same stuff you make bread and wine with, though those varieties probably wouldn’t make very good beer. Most brewer supply stores will stock a variety of liquid and dry yeast matched to the type of beer you are brewing. 

Ales, Lagers, and Lambics While there are many different styles and varieties of beer, they all fall under one of two main categories, Ales and Lagers, the difference being the yeast and the temperature of fermentation. 

Ale yeast ferments between 59- 68°F and normally form a foam on the surface of the yeast. They are sometimes called “top-fermenting” because of this, but there are varieties of ale yeast that settle to the bottom. 

Lagers were originally fermented in caves in Bavaria at temperatures of about 50°F. Lagers are then stored at near freezing temperatures for about thirty days to let the beer mellow. Most American and German beers, including dark German beers, are lagers. American lagers are based on a light lager called Pilsner, after its origin in Pilsen, Czech Republic. 

Lambics have become more popular in the U.S. lately. Lambics are primarily brewed in Belgium (and often called Belgian beer). They are created using open fermentation; the unfermented wort is left open to the air, allowing airborne yeast and bacteria to enter and ferment the wort. The bacteria typically add a sour taste to the beer. Many home brew stores now stock the yeast and bacterial cultures needed to make Lambics. Unless you live in Brussels, open fermentation is not recommended. 

Water Often overlooked in beer making is the primary ingredient, water. The characteristics of the water used can have a significant effect on the flavor and quality of the beer. The common examples are Dublin’s hard water used in Guinness and Burton, England’s gypsum laced water . Most US brewers add gypsum to their pale ales, and the soft water of Pilsen is used in their light lagers. Since water tends to vary by region, your local home brew store or club is probably the best resource. 

Other ingredients Germany has a beer purity law, the Reinheitsgebot, that dates from 1516 and states that the only ingredients in beer could be water, barely, hops, and (added later) yeast. Of course that hasn’t stopped people in other countries from using other ingredients, and even in Germany wheat beers aren’t uncommon. Other grains are often used, including oats (oatmeal stout), rye, and rice.  
Priming Techniques Priming was mentioned in passing earlier, but a better explanation is probably warranted. When the beer is fermenting, the CO2 is being let off through the airlock, keeping the pressuring from building up inside the fermenter. When you bottle (or keg) live beer, you want a certain amount of pressure and CO2 build up to carbonate the beer and give it a head. Unfortunately, all the fementable sugar has already been used, if you just bottle the beer it’ll be flat. Priming adds just enough fermentable sugar for the yeast to carbonate the beer and pressurize the bottle, but not so much (hopefully) as to blow the lid off the bottles. One of the “purity” issues some home brewers have is the use of corn sugar for priming. After all, beer is supposed to be just barely, hops, water, and yeast. In practice, the amount of corn sugar is small and it’s added so late in the process, it really isn’t a significant difference in taste. Since corn sugar ferments much faster than the alternatives, you’ll be able to enjoy your beer two weeks or more sooner than with the other techniques. With that in mind, the first alternative is to simply use malt extract, typically DME, in place of corn sugar, the difference being the amount. Typically ¾ of a cup of corn sugar is used per 5 gallons of beer, with DME use 1 ¼ cups. Keep in mind this will add about two more weeks before the beer is ready, but if you’re making a stout, that won’t be so important since you’ll probably be aging it 6 to 10 weeks anyway. If you’re making an Irish red, you’ve probably just doubled the time before you can drink your beer. 

The second method is kraeusening, or using unfermented wort to prime. There are two problems with this. First, where do you get unfermented wort? And second, how do you determine how much to use? The traditional method of getting unfermented wort was to steal some from the batch of beer you brewed and bottling the last time. That’s not terribly practical for most of us, but we so have something that will help--a refrigerator. Simply take about a quart of wort (before you add the yeast) and store it in a sanitized, sealed container in your fridge until you’re ready to bottle. Determining the amount to use is a bit more difficult. You’re going to need a hydrometer and some math, and probably a book, namely Charlie Papazian’s “Complete Joy of Home Brewing”, which explains the calculations in detail.  
Alternatives to Bottling To be frank, bottling is a pain. Most beer brewers wind up using some alternate to bottling beer, ranging from flip top growlers and other large bottles to Cornelius kegs. Cornelius kegs are the ultimate in quality, consistency, and conveniences, presuming you have a place to store and cool them, like a kegorator or a spare fridge in the garage. They can often be rented from a brew store as well, so even if you don’t have the space they may be viable for parties. Tap-a-draft, Party Pigs, and mini-keg systems like Party Star are popular alternatives that provide keg-like freshness, keep beer fresh for extended periods, and will fit in your fridge. Most require two containers per 5 gallons of beer, reducing your bottling time quite a bit. Check with your local store. It probably carries one or more types. And just having the parts on hand can be a real convenience.",
Wine Tasting,"Wine Tasting Information  Wine Tasting As A Hobby We’ve heard a lot about wine tasting, and often it seems intimidating since one is not quite sure about what to do! But to take up wine tasting as a hobby, all you need is your senses! Then come the right atmosphere, focus, an imaginative way of expressing yourself, an excellent memory, etc. Anyone can learn to become a wine taster with some guidance and there are several institutions that offer wine tasting courses for different levels. 
Why taste wine? Specifically, we observe the color, the aroma or fragrance, the flavor and the sensation of the wine inside the mouth. You are probably wondering, why taste wine? There are many objectives of wine tasting. Firstly, it helps to assess the quality and value of the wine. Then, you can decide whether the wine can be served to drink – or whether it must be stored in the bottle for longer. The flavor and fragrance can be examined for study. There are various aspects of the wine that are appreciated and these also help to identify any shortcomings in the wine. Basically, tasting the wine helps to know and understand the wine and there are many methods used by wine tasters. Expert wine tasters remember wines, including the way it tasted and what they liked about it! 
Types Of Wines Did you know that wines are differentiated by type according to whether they are sweet or dry and their appearance? As a result, you have the following: 

• Sparkling wines, which are bubbly, white and rather dry, which means they are not sweet. 

• Dessert wines that are quite sweet   • Table wines that can be white, a blush pink or red in color and can be dry or sweet. 

• Fortified wines, which are better known as port wine or sherry. 

When you visit a winery, the most popular wines there are the table wines. 
Steps To Wine Tasting Now let us look at the main steps you will come across in a wine-tasting session. Here’s what you will experience: 

• The color of the wine, since its age is arrived at by its color. So, darker wines are older. The best wines are more concentrated in taste. 

• The aroma is strong in quality wines. Wines that smell good are good wines. 

• The taste of the wine 

• The assessment of the wine – made by the perception that the longer the taste and smell linger in your mouth, the better the wine.   Tasting the wine, as mentioned earlier is a matter of using your senses. 

How will we do this? 

Seeing the wine: White wines are light yellow or golden in appearance. Red wines are a brick red or purplish in color and then we have the pink wine. To know the exact shade, you raise your glass and see it against a white background. 

Smelling the wine: the fragrance of the wine comes from the grapes and the process of winemaking. The wine taster swirls the wine in its glass and then smells it. Tasters find a multitude of smells, depending on the kind of the wine. 

Tasting the wine: The taster now takes a small sip and lets it roll around inside his mouth to feel its taste and texture. This could be light, strong, or refreshing. 

After tasting the wine, some tasters swallow the wine, while others just spit it out. Why spit it out? Because when several wines are being tasted, the taster cannot swallow all the wine! In fact, there’s a bucket at the wine tasting that is provided for this. Also, you obviously can’t drive after you swallow all the wines you taste! 

Wine tasters express themselves quite articulately about how they feel after tasting the wine and share their views with others to get a good understanding of it. Most tasters actually make written notes to help them assess the wine rather than depend on their memory alone. These notes also serve as a reference point when it comes to evaluating a wine from the same area or of the same vintage.   
Some Interesting Facts You will find that wine tasting parties and events are very interesting. However, there are some facts you should know, that will make your experience better. In these events, the women are always served first. You can also expect to be served water in between wines to enable you clean your mouth to taste the various wines. Remember to hold the wine glass by its stem because holding it in your palms will heat the wine, and also prevent you from noticing its true color. Small snacks are also served, and you can have them, to be ready for the next wine! Wine is always served in clear glasses to enable you observe its color and you are expected to swirl it around before tasting it. Then inhale the aroma. After this, you are expected to sip the wine and hold it in your mouth and let your taste buds experience it fully before swallowing it. 

It is a good idea to learn something about the kinds of wines before you decide to go to a wine tasting event to help you understand the various flavors and also know what to expect. Wine tasting is an exciting as well as educative experience. 
Wine Tasting Courses There are many wine tasting courses offered by recognized institutions and here you will learn about the techniques that will help you become a professional at wine tasting. You will learn to identify the year, type and flavor of the wine in addition to how wine is processed. You will learn how to select glasses for the wine, and what kind of cuisine is suited to a specific wine. The basic course usually cover information about how wine is prepared, how it is served and how to taste it. If you already know something about wine tasting you can go to the next level and learn about types of grapes, and enhance your knowledge and tasting skills. The advanced courses provide exhaustive knowledge about particular types of wines. 

The above information is aimed at giving you the impetus to get started. You can develop your wine tasting skills and get lots of tips and instructional videos at Discover A Hobby. You will also find some terrific books and recommended links where you can learn and know everything you need about wine tasting in depth. So go ahead and get started!",
Wingsuit Flying,"Wingsuit Flying Information  Introduction For thousands of years, mankind has looked to the skies with envy for the birds that floated free high above. The idea of being able to join them in their activity drove men and women for years to attempt to solve one of the most basic desires, which was to fly. Now, mankind has soared in hot air balloons to incredible heights, built airplanes and jets that defy the sound barrier and scrape the edge of outer space, and have sent men to the moon. 

Yet for some thrill seekers, this isn’t enough. They want to fly through the air just like those winged creatures that can dive and turn and roll, chase and evade prey and predators alike. To be able to spread one’s arms out wide and use knowledge and skill to guide them in their flight continues to call to the most extreme adventurers. 

The result is called wingsuit flying. This fairly new development of sport was born out of this evolutionary desire, this connection to the birds and the sense of freedom, of excitement, of speed and agility. The activity itself requires an extreme amount of skill, as well as fearlessness, as the speeds that are attained and the terrain that is often covered, expect the greatest respect and forgive very little. 

Experienced wingsuit flyers have many years of skydiving experience under their belt and are usually certified skydivers. Some of the most extreme videos of wingsuit flying show some of these avid enthusiasts scraping the edge of cliffs or buildings, practically close enough to tough the surface of the rock with their bare hands, all while cruising at seventy, eighty, ninety, and even over one hundred miles per hour. 

These experienced professionals make wingsuit flying look so easy that anyone could do it, but there is a calculated experience and training that goes into each of these jumps and without the proper training, without the proper equipment and guidance, and without considering the right location in which to make that jump, the excitement can quickly turn into tragedy. 

Anyone who is considering wingsuit flying should discuss their desire with an experience wingsuit flyer. They can also discuss this desire with certified skydiving instructors and professionals. Wingsuit flying is for the most resilient and die hard individual, sometimes referred to as the ‘adrenaline junkie,’ but if you have the resolve, the desire, and the ability to be patient until you’re ready for that first wingsuit flight, then you can join the ranks of those incredible men and women who soar like the birds and chase excitement down wherever it tries to hide. 
Getting Started: What to Know Before getting started in the sport of wingsuit flying, there are several things that someone should test about themselves to determine whether or not this sport is even worth pursuing. The first thing is to determine one’s fear of extreme heights. If you can’t climb to the top of a tall building and look down, or if you have a serious compunction to avoid stepping toward the edge of a rock cliff high up over the countryside, then wingsuit flying may not be the best choice for your thrills. 

Wingsuit flying, much like base jumping, is generally monopolized by the daring souls who have an affinity for the dangerous activities in life. If you have a hard time dealing with high speeds in tight traffic situations, for example, then wingsuit flying is something you may not wish to consider. 

However, this isn’t a hard and true fact of life. Not for everyone. Wingsuit flying doesn’t have to take place in the most extreme locations and it doesn’t have to involve the same time of thrill that base jumping offers. Many wingsuit flyers limit themselves to the same airplane jumps as they would when skydiving. The only real difference there is that instead of simply freefalling and possibly guiding yourself to a certain location, you would use a wingsuit to simulate the act of truly flying, getting anywhere between one to three minutes of flight time in before the parachute would need to be pulled. 

It has been well documented that people who have an inherent fear of heights have gone onto to enjoy skydiving more than they ever thought imaginable. The lesson here is to determine whether this is something for you, whether on the extreme end of jumps or the most basic of skydives, and if so, where to go from there. 
What Does It Take to Learn to Wingsuit Fly? Before anyone can strap on a wingsuit and take to the skies like the majestic eagle, they must first learn how to skydive. It harkens back to the old adage that before one can learn to run, he or she must first learn to walk and in order to do that, he or she needs to learn to crawl. 

Doing anything in life requires small steps and in the case of wingsuit flying, those steps take time. How much time will be determined by the individual and one person’s actions or expectations should not be conveyed onto someone else. For example, it may take one individual a few months to go from their first skydiving lesson to their first wingsuit flight. However, it may take another person a few years. 

Don’t rush through any of the steps in the hope of reaching your goals quicker. The sport, under the right guidance and instruction, is considered quite safe, but the wrong moves at the wrong time can be devastating, even fatal. Any time a person jumps from an airplane, or the base of a cliff, or some other location, there is risk. Maintaining safety should always be priority number one. 
How to Start the Wingsuit Flying Experience The first thing that you will need to do is find a certified and qualified skydiving instructor. There are many options available to determine if wingsuit flying is right for you. The first is the tandem skydive. 

The tandem jump is basically a jump where a certified skydiving professional jumps with you, harnessed to you the entire time. You are positioned at the front so that you can experience the full breadth of the dive itself, from the moment you leave the plane to the minute your feet touch the ground. 

The advantage of the tandem jump is that you don’t need any special training in order to perform it. There is usually just a few short lessons in how to land in order to avoid injury to ankles or legs, but beyond that, the instructor is responsible for guiding you two to the ground and pulling the chute. 

This is a great first test to see if wingsuit flying would even be an option. Why? If you can’t handle the tandem dive, if your fear is too intense and you wouldn’t wish to go back up and do it again, then you may not be a good candidate for wingsuit flying. 

The next step is to sign up for and train to go on a solo skydive jump. This is where you jump by yourself, with no one harnessed to you, but in a group, whether it’s with other novice jumpers or with experienced professionals. You are fully responsible for all aspects of the dive, from pulling the chute at the right time to guiding yourself to the landing zone, to easing yourself onto the ground. 

These dives require some classroom work and other training in order to fully understand the entire aspect of the skydiving experience. When you have solo skydiving down and there aren’t any issues that you have, meaning you are comfortable will all phases and prove that you can maneuver and control your dive from beginning to end, then you are ready to begin your wingsuit flying experience. 
How Wingsuit Flying Works One of the most difficult aspects of wingsuit flying to get used to is steering oneself through the air like a bird. The fabric and the design of the wingsuit is unique and the human body was simply not designed for this kind of experience. It takes some getting used to. 

There are several methods that are used to help train people in the art of using a wingsuit, but the most popular is called the wind tunnel. In effect, this is not a tunnel but the wind is generated from a massive fan below the person’s body. This fan simulates wind resistance during a free fall. 

The power of the wind generated during this exercise is enough to lift a person’s body into the air. From there, the individual will learn to balance and maneuver themselves using the wingsuit. Shifting the arms back will help a person accelerate while dipping the arms to one side or the other will be used for steering. 

A person can also shift their entire body to one side to alter their experience. This entire training exercise is akin to some surfing instructions that use virtual waves, or wave generators to allow people to get used to balancing on a surfboard before taking to the open waters. Getting used to the feel before being thrown into the actual situation can be life-saving. 
Frequently Asked Questions What is the attraction of wingsuit diving? 

Different strokes for different folks, basically. The idea of wingsuit flying is that it gives a person the sense of true and free flying, without anything around them, or anything guiding them. They are free to maneuver however they would like, just as the birds in the sky do. 

Of course, wingsuit flying can be done from more than just an airplane and for some extreme adventurers, this is the true thrill. To be able to graze the side of a building or cliff when base jumping is an adrenaline rush that is difficult to duplicate. It’s certainly not for everyone and those individuals who are thinking about taking up wingsuit flying should take the necessary steps and precautions to remain safe. 

Is wingsuit diving safe? 

Wingsuit diving, when done with caution and care, is as safe as skydiving, which has become an exceptionally safe recreation. The redundancy in skydiving of having two parachutes, one as the primary, and one as the secondary, has saved many people from serious injury and possibly even death. 

However, as with any activity of this kind, wingsuit flying does carry with it some measure of risk. How much risk is entirely dependent on the person taking part. At no point should anyone feel pressured into this activity nor should anyone feel that they must be subjected to another individual’s carelessness. 

Safety is the rule and when that is done, then wingsuit flying is relatively safe. 

Where can I purchase a wingsuit? 

While there are many manufacturers that make wingsuits, they aren’t available in every corner clothing, sporting, or specialty shop. You can find some of these wingsuits online through certain distributors, but quality is what matters most when it comes to wingsuits. As in scuba diving, you wouldn’t want to head deep underwater with secondary quality equipment and you shouldn’t consider heading up into the sky with a wingsuit that could tear or fall apart or fail for any number of reasons. 

Contact your local certified skydiving instructor and find out what the best wingsuits are and where you can purchase one. Most of these shops will have them available, but without the proper experience, they may reserve the right not to sell them to you. 

I’ve been skydiving for years, and I’m certified, what do I have to do in order to winguit fly.? 

Contact your local skydiving professional and inquire about their requirements to wingsuit fly. Different instructors will have different expectations and requirements, as well as different methods of teaching wingsuit flying. Shop around if you feel more comfortable as being comfortable with the people with whom your surround yourself should be tantamount to a safe and enjoyable wingsuit flying experience. 
Conclusion Wingsuit flying isn’t for everyone, but if skydiving is something that has interested you for years and you think about the thrill of flying like the birds, then wingsuit flying may be the perfect answer to your desire for thrill and excitement. Wingsuit flying can be very safe, or it can be very dangerous, putting the individual and others at risk for the chase of excitement. It all depends on the individual. 

Wingsuit flying is an experience like no other and for those that are willing and able to pursue this fantastic recreational activity, its rewards can equal a lifetime of stories and memories to share with friends, family, and strangers for years to come.",
Sewing,"Sewing Information  Introduction Sewing can be a very useful and rewarding hobby. There are a number of different types of sewing and they all serve their own unique purposes. You can also choose to sew by hand or learn to sew by machine, with each offering their own benefits and their detractions. Sewing is seen by many as a dying art but it can be a very relaxing and rewarding hobby, as you are able to create beautiful masterpieces and repair clothes. 

Sewing can be used to tailor clothes, create quilts, bags or just about anything. You can even learn to decorate and personalize a variety of different items. 
History of Sewing Sewing is a skill practiced by nearly every human civilization on the planet, both past and present. Current archeologists place sewing all the way to the Paleolithic era (30,000 BC). Needles have been found made out bone that were used to sew together furs and skins. It wasn’t until the 3rd century BC, in Germany that needles were made out of iron. Then in a Han temple in China the oldest thimble was discovered as part of a full sewing set. The thimble dates from around 200 BC to 200 AD. 

This would be as far advanced as sewing would get until 1790 when the first sewing machine was invented. This sewing machine created chain stitches and was designed for leather and canvas, mainly for creating boots. It wasn’t until 1830 that the first practical sewing machine was invented. Ten years later these machines were employed in the creation of French military uniforms, unfortunately the factory was destroyed by tailors who feared being replaced by machines. 

But despite their success none of these sewing machines were able to compete with hand sewing. That was until 1846 when Elias Howe created a machine that could sew perfectly straight seams. Sewing machines continued to improve and provide more services as the years advanced. 

Today many people sew both by hands and through sewing machines, this is both due to preference and through necessity. Many people claim that items sewn by hand are of a higher quality while items sewn with a sewing machine are often more precise. Machines used by the average person are sometimes too bulky or narrow to use on certain projects, so it is often necessary to have an idea of how to become involved with both types of sewing. 
Types of Sewing There are two main types of sewing. The first is known as plain sewing and the second is known as fancy sewing. Plain sewing consists of the sewing that creates clothes, simple blankets and even shoes. This type of sewing can be easy to learn at first but more advanced clothes can involve more difficult stitches and patterns that can sometimes be tricky to understand. 

Fancy sewing involves the more decorative types of stitching such as embroidery, shirring, smocking and quilting. Embroidery is among the most well-known and most pursued by hobbyists. Most craft stores will sell cross-stitch and embroidery kits to create works of art that can be framed or blankets for infants. Larger embroidery projects such as tablecloths and napkins can also be purchased as kits and are perfect for the beginner. 

Embroidery involves a number of different stitches but all of these are explained in the pattersn to the kits. There are two main types of embroidery kits, counted cross-stitch and stamped cross-stich. Counted cross stitch can be more difficult for children and people who are not confident counting stitches on a grid. Stamped cross-stitch involves stitching over a stamped pattern on a cloth. The two types are usually for different types of projects with counted cross-stitch usually for creating farmable art and stamped cross-stitch is for creating blankets, table cloths and other projects. 

Working from kits and patterns is often easier for a beginner but once you gain confidence you can start learning how to create your own projects and create truly unique and personal gifts and creations. 
Tools of Sewing There are many different tools of sewing that go far beyond the basic needle and thread. But beyond the basic needle there are a wide variety of different needles that are used for a number of different types of projects. The following is a short list of just some of the different tools you may encounter while learning to sew.  
Thimble The thimble was created and is used to prevent the needle from slipping.  
Seam Ripper A seam ripper is a small tool used for unpicking stitches.  
Sewing Machine A sewing machine is a very useful tool for anyone who wants to become involved with tailoring clothes or quilts. But depending on the features you want they can also be very expensive. The most well-known sewing machine brand is a Singer sewing machine and they are often credited with being among the best. 

Sewing machines can do a number of different stitches and some of this most modern machines can even embroider entire designs with just the touch of a button. Basic sewing machines can be found for around $200 but more elaborate machines can go as high as $2000. 
Understanding Sewing Patterns Sewing patterns have long since been developed in order to ensure that clothes or other objects are created the same every time. Now they are used as a way to help people at home create their own clothes. 

Using these patterns can often be tricky even though they come with instructions. Bold lines usually imply where you cut and each piece that you cut will tell you how many to cut. Sometimes it will tell you to cut on the fold. This means that you line up the pattern with the edge of the fabric and then cut around it and leave the fold entact. 

There are also small triangles to cut or areas to mark that will help you line up the patterns. Normally the patterns will be laid on top of the fabric and most people will use pins to attach them to the fabric to make sure that the pattern does not move while cutting. 

The pattern instructions will then tell you how to sew the pieces together, but the most complicated the article of clothing the more difficult the stitches may be. Some of them will involve pleating and other techniques which may be difficult for the beginner. For that reason it is good for someone just starting out to try their hands at beginner projects first. These are normally projects that involve mainly straight sewing, either by hand or with a sewing machine. 

Sewing can be a very time consuming and difficult hobby. It can also be expensive if you choose to purchase a sewing machine in order to pursue this hobby. But for the person who wishes to sew by hand or learn to embroider by hand, the projects can be very cheaply done. Patterns can be found for free online or complete kits can be found at craft stores for around $20 - $30.",
Bridge,"Bridge Information  Intro Bridge is a stimulating card game that keeps your mind active no matter what your age. In fact, as you grow older, and less mobile, bridge can be a great way to spend time companionably with your friends and fellow players. While not exactly the easiest game to master, these days you will find plenty of resources, both online and offline that can get you adept at the game with enough practice. What is more, you will also find that you enjoy yourself tremendously. 

Among the main reasons that people take up bridge as a hobby, meeting interesting people ranks the highest. Since you play in pairs, you can join a bridge club to find players and make friends. Whether you choose to play online on the Internet or offline with real people, you would need to learn the card game. When you know how to play, how to bid, which card to play first, understanding what it means when other people bid, etc. you too can take part in this game that keeps you mentally on your toes. 

You might wonder why bridge is so popular. If you ask people who really enjoy the card game, you will find that they consider it the ideal game when they are entertaining, particularly if they are meeting up with another couple. However, that doesn’t mean only four people can play. Bridge is flexible enough to be adapted to larger groups so that you can have card parties, bridge clubs and even take part in bridge tournaments when you get really serious about the game. Once you begin to play bridge, you will find yourself getting involved with the game and discover that you have a lot to talk about with others who are interested in the game as well, sharing tricks and tips. 
How To Get Started Perhaps the best way to begin to learn bridge is find a group of people who play regularly. They might allow you to observe the game and even teach you what the basic rules are. The good news is that bridge is a social game and players are invariably quite amicable about letting in newcomers. By associating yourself with a group, you can get valuable information about the intricacies of the game. You can also ask questions and benefit from knowledge from players who have different styles. Even as you grasp the game, you will have a ready-made group with which to play. 

Bridge is a serious hobby with millions of people across the world. To get you started with the game, here is a very brief outline of what the game involves. There are many nuances, tricks and methods to the game that you will learn as you actually play. 
Technicalities Of Bridge There are four players, with two playing against two as partners. Even if there are more players, only four play at a time. We have the deck or the pack of cards numbering 52 comprising of four ‘suits’ of thirteen cards per suit. You will notice that there are two packs of different designs. When one pack is dealt, the other is shuffled by the dealers partner in readiness for the next deal. You need to know the rank of the suits for bidding. Spades are highest, followed by hearts, diamonds and clubs. Hearts and spades are called the major suits while clubs and diamonds are the minor suits. At the time play, all suits are of equal rank except when there is a trump suit, when it outranks the others. Cards are ranked in ‘play’ in the order of A which is the highest, then K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 being the lowest. 

There’s the draw for partners, followed by the shuffle, the cut and the deal. All rotations in bridge happen clockwise whether it is the turn to deal, call or to play. Once each player looks at his cards, he or she must make a call. A call is a pass, a bid, a double or a redouble. Then the bid is reviewed if a player asks to have his previous calls restated. 

The player who first bid the suit of the contract is called the declarer. The partner of the declarer is the dummy. The remaining two players are the defenders. When play starts, it involves taking a card from the hand and facing it upwards on the table. You will learn about tricks, dummy etc. Play concludes when thirteen tricks are completed. Scoring is an aspect of the game that you must learn. 

Most people who enjoy bridge consider it the greatest among card games as it is both challenging and enjoyable for as long as you live. When you get started, it is a good idea to learn the play first so that you have a good understanding of the bidding part of the game.

Bridge Bidding Tips There seems to be many rules when you first start to learn bridge, particularly during the bidding. However, when you start to see the structure behind each bidding system it will all fall into place so don`t give up! 

It sometimes helps to think of bidding as a three step process. The first part is the exploratory stage, for example an opening bid followed by a change of suit. During this early stage of the bidding, most emphasis is placed on finding a `fit`, which is a suit in which you and your partner have a combined total of 8 cards. 

Once a player has found a fit, or chooses to bid notrumps, the emphasis shifts to describing the strength of your hand. Supporting your partner or bidding notrumps is often referred to as making a `limit` bid, because at that point you try to indicate to your partner the upper and lower limits of your strength. 

Finally, once a player has made a limit bid, partner is in a position to choose the final contract. 

Here is an example. South bids 1H showing 5 hearts and 12 or more points. (Notice that the point count is not yet well defined.) North responds 1S showing 4 or more spades and 6 or more points. (Still neither player has closely defined his or her strength). South now bids 2S and that`s a limit bid because it is showing support for partner`s suit. Limit bids also define strength and in this case 2S shows a minimum opening bid. (3S would be stronger.) South has shown hearts, spades and a minimum opening hand so North calculates the combined assets and chooses the final contract. 

Of course this three step process doesn`t cover every situation, but it`s a good starting point to help you make sense of all the rules.",
Cats,"Cats Information  Introduction One of the greatest and most beloved pets in the entire world is of course the cat. Throughout most of history, there has always been a tight competition between cat and dog lovers over which people is the better of the two. If we go strictly by the numbers, with a staggering worldwide population of over 500 million, cats are perhaps the most common pet throughout the entire world. But dog owners are always quick to remind that the most loyal animal of all is the dog, and that the cat is at best a snooty prissy animal. Although they live their lives like kings and queens, they are highly intelligent animals that enjoys companionships, and probably the most personable pet in the entire pet industry. Not only are they simply fantastic animals, they have been human companions for thousands of years, and they will go on to be companions for thousands of more. So popular are these as pets, that there is a danger in North America of the cat population exploding out of control due to the lack of sterilizations being performed. Every year more and more cats end up on the street, essentially becoming feral cats, and freely reproducing at will. Although it is a fantastic hobby to be part of, there is also a lot of responsibility associated with the keeping and care of cats. 
Purchasing Your First Cat The first rule about purchasing your first cat is to buy a species that is interesting to you. Never be persuaded to purchase a cat that you don’t want because you are told it is an a “better or worse” breed than another. If it is a cat that you don’t really want, then it is a pet that you will grow tired of in the future. Regardless of what type it is that you want, you have to ensure you do all the research about it prior to purchasing it so that you take proper care of your new cat from day one. Most people think that all cats are the same, but nothing can be further from the truth. Although they all can be kept indoors, there are different types of cats that require more of less room, or different types of toys or structures. A little bit of research goes a long way, and it pays off in the long run. 

One of the most debated issues in North America right now is whether to purchase from a private breeder, a pet store, or an animal shelter. Here is an argument that is based on a few too many bad apples spoiling it for the bunch. But over the past twenty years, there have been numerous cases of poor quality cats and kittens being sold by people thinking only of profit as their animals suffer from neglect. Thankfully, there has been numerous enthusiasts stepping forward to challenge pet stores to live up to the higher standards people expect from them. 

There have also been numerous pet stores in North America that have been promoting adoptions from pet shelters rather than selling cats or kittens at all. Because of the explosion of pet cats in the past three decades, there is a steady incline in the dog and cat population that has many people worried about the growing number of homeless and neglected pets. Although it is great if you can save a cat from an animal shelter and give it a second lease at life, there is also nothing wrong with purchasing a cat from a store or private breeder. The fact is that you will probably want a specific cat that only a breeder or store can get you so a shelter is right out. You just have to remember that pet stores purchase cats from breeders and mark up the prices, so it would in fact be considerably cheaper purchasing a cat from a breeder. 

As a general rule of thumb, always try to purchase the healthiest cat or kitten available. This is easily done by purchasing the largest in a group that has bright eyes and is active. Larger animals typically mean that they are being well fed and cared for. With cats, assuming they are taken care of well, will generally all be of the same size and weight when you see them in a pet store window or in a litter of kittens at a breeders residence. If a cat is skinny and not active, then it is best to leave it be. It’s far too easy to succumb to a sick kitten pulling at your heart strings, but when it comes to cat illnesses, there is a steep financial cost to making a sick kitten well again. A healthy animal can live many years, and if you put in the time that is necessary, you will be rewarded in the long run. 
Required Equipment The great thing about cats is that there is virtually no equipment required to giving these little guys a great home. The reason behind this is that Cats are a cosmopolitan species and are found across much of the world. They are extremely adaptable and are now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, which includes sub-Antarctic islands such as the Kerguelen Islands. This ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat has led to the cat`s designation as one of the world`s worst invasive species. Although this is a huge negative for wild life, it also means that with little effort, you can easily bring a cat into your home without purchasing expensive equipment. 

There is also a large variety of items you can purchase for your cat that are useful, but not necessarily required for their health. Collars are a great idea if you are planning to frequently walk you new pet, and the pets identification, like home address and phone number, can easily be attached to the collar should your cat run away. Of course if you are planning on walking your cat, which an increasing amount of people that do, then a leash is the best way to always maintain control over your pet’s actions. Leashes and collars can also be purchased to match your cat’s personality like tough guy spiked collar or diamond studded collar for your little princess. In the same line of thought, there are numerous lines of clothing that you can purchase for your pets. The last random thing you should also buy is a food and water dish for your little kitten or cat. They will eat out of virtually anything, but it’s a good idea to have specific bowls that are for just the cat that could even match his or her personality. 

The last and only item that you have to buy for you cat is a litter box for them to go to the washroom in. Since cats bury their urine and feces, it is important to provide them with a box containing kitty litter. This is an absorbent material, often bentonite, shredded paper, or wood chips, or sometimes sand in which your local pet store will carry a large variety of litters. It should be cleaned daily and changed often, depending on the number of cats in a household and the type of litter; if it is not kept clean, a cat may be fastidious enough to find other locations in the house for urination or defecation. This may also happen for other reasons; for instance, if a cat becomes constipated and defecation is uncomfortable, it may associate the discomfort with the litter box and avoid it in favor of another location. Daily attention to the litter box also serves as a monitor of the cat`s health. Bentonite or clumping litter is a variation which absorbs urine into clumps which can be sifted out along with feces, and thus stays cleaner longer with regular sifting, but has sometimes been reported to cause health problems in some cats. Without a containers such as this, your entire house could become a kitty litter container, and with the strong odor associated with cat urine, it is best to have a frequently clean a kittle litter container. 
A Specialized Diet Although cat food always has, and always will be highly debated by the numerous competing cat food companies throughout the world, the only real issue that I have with the above descriptions is the idea of vegetarian food for cats. The simple fact about cats is that they are meat eaters, and in no way should they be fed a non-meat diet. This idea of cats being vegetarian is nothing more than human owners expressing their way of life onto their pet. Unlike other people who can choose whether or not to eat in this way, cats are entirely dependent on their human owners, so they have no choice in what they get to eat. As wild animals, there is now way that a cat would be willing to eat a patch of grass or a bush of berries instead of anther wild animal. Can you imagine a Tiger or Lion having a salad for a meal instead of an antelope? 

The other highly debated item in regards to cat food is the inclusion of animal byproducts into the food. A majority of lesser quality foods support the fact that animal-by-products should be in all cat foods. What is an animal-by-product? Think of a cat food that has chicken-by-product in the ingredient list, and then imagine that the whole chicken has gone into making that cat food compared to a food using chicken meal, which is only the actual meat of the chicken. The argument behind by-products is that in the wild, catss will eat the whole animal. This of course if absolutely true, but it not necessarily good for them to eat a whole chicken. These lesser quality pet foods are misleading because if makes it seem like you are feeding your cat chicken when you are actually feeding you cats chicken and random parts of that chicken. 

One of the best advancements in the pet food industry is the specially formulated foods for cats allergic to common ingredients such as chicken, wheat, or corn. These foods usually contain ""novel proteins"" and substitute uncommon starches for the usual grains. Meats used in allergy formulas can range from the mundane, such as lamb, beef, or whitefish, to the unusual, such as venison or duck. Carbohydrates in allergy formulas are usually a less common grain, such as rice or barley, but such ingredients as potato and quinoa are sometimes used. Allergies are more likely to develop with consistent exposure to certain proteins. The problems that arise from these types of foods, especially lamb based, is that they have grown so popular that people don’t realize that they are for allergy prone animals. Not that there is anything wrong with feeding cats without allergies these foods, but the general idea is to feed your cat the basic chicken formula and then switch them to an allergy formula should allergies arise from the chicken. This way you can try to point out the ingredient that they are most likely allergic too. 
Conclusion Perhaps it is a return to the times when cats were thought to be sacred animals, but the proud, snooty nature of cats is something that has never changes. Plus if cat owners have their way, it is something that will never change. There really isn’t anything as amazing at the domesticated cat because it is like having your own pet tiger or lion in your very own house. Next time you go to a zoo, watch the big cats for awhile and you will notice that your little cat at home acts in the exact same manner. Sure their teeth are a lot shorter than their cousins, but to a mouse or bird, those teeth are the same size as a tiger’s teeth to a human. This is the best part about cats because they act like they have never been domesticated as they stock their bowl of dry kibble, pounce across clean laundry at a piece of string, and sharpen their mighty claws on your new leather couch. Ouch! Okay, so not everything about cats are good for the home, but with a lot of toys and scratching posts, you can save your furniture from their vicious attacks. The one thing you always have to remember is to keep your can indoors, or to make sure it is sterilized to prevent it from coming home pregnant or making the neighbor’s cat pregnant. You just always have to remember that with passion and respect, a cat can be the greatest passion of your entire life.",
SingingThe act of using one’s voice as a flexible musical instrument.,"Singing as a HobbySinging – we all do it, don’t we? In the shower, the car, when no one is listening, we sing. But take it up a notch and singing can be a fun and rewarding hobby. In essence, singing is using the human voice as a musical instrument, and a very flexible instrument at that. It’s the only form of music where there are words to give specific meaning, augmented by the melodies, tones, and rhythms used by other instruments. Singing ranges from songs around a campfire to High Mass in a cathedral, and everywhere in between. It is often accompanied by other vocalists (singers) or instruments. Pretty much everyone can sing ‘Happy Birthday’ or “Row, Row, Row, your boat’, but singing as a hobby implies performing in public, and without a bit of basic knowledge extended singing can lead to issues from a simple sore throat to nodes on your vocal chords that may require surgery. This article attempts to cover the basics of singing, including styles, techniques, health tips, and some general ideas on getting started in your new hobby.",https://www.discoverahobby.com/singing#
Aikido,"Aikido Information  Introduction Aikido is a Japanese ‘peaceful’ martial art (or ‘Budo’) incorporating a series of twisting, throwing and joint lock techniques, developed by Morihei Ueshiba, and combines the martial arts of Judo and Jujitsu. Aikido does not involve punching or kicking another person. It is much more about learning to use another’s energy for control through the dynamics of movement – motion. 

Morihei Ueshiba, or ‘O Sensei’, meaning ‘Great Teacher’, developed Aikido to concentrate on the aspects of morality and spirituality by developing harmony and peace. Aikido could be translated to: “The Way of Harmony of the Spirit”. 

Students of O Sensei over the years have developed their own ‘styles’ of Aikido, principally down the way they have interpreted the ways of Aikido. There are no competitions or tournaments, contests or ‘sparring’ when learning Aikido. Morihei Ueshiba’s Dojo (or ‘school’) Regulations recommend that:   1. You always follow the teacher’s instructions carefully. 

2. You learn how to deal with more than one enemy; to be alert from all sides. 

3. All Aikido training must take place in a pleasant and happy atmosphere. 

4. At the start of training, develop movement of the body before going on to more intensive practice techniques; never force any movement. 

5. The purpose of Aikido is to train the mind and the body. 

It takes longer to learn and master the art of Aikido, longer than Karate, Tae Kwon Do or Kempo, and plenty of practice and training is required before it can be used effectively in self-defense. 
History of Aikido Morihei Ueshiba was born in 1883 in Japan and, after witnessing his father being attacked by local thugs for political reasons, he vowed to become strong to avenge his father. He practiced martial arts, gaining certificates in Jujitsu, fencing and spear fighting. Later, he started to look into religion and then combined his religious and political ideologies with ‘budo’, or the martial arts, to create “aikibudo” and “aikinomichi”, which became Aikido in 1942. 
Techniques of Aikido Aikido is developed from the throws and joint locks of Jujitsu, particularly daito-ryu jujitsu, the body movements of sword or spear fighting, and Morihei Ueshiba’s own innovations. 

The fundamentals, such as ki, posture, centre or core, are key elements to learning Aikido and the techniques that have been developed are a way of expressing these fundamentals. Without the fundamentals learnt and in place, the techniques would not work as well. There are 10 groups of techniques in Aikido which are: 

1. Tachiwaza-mae – which are attacks from the front in a standing position. 

2. Tachiwaza-ushiro – which are attacks from the rear in a standing position. 

3. Suwariwaza – with uke (the recipient of the technique to be practiced) and tori (the person initiating the attack) sitting. 

4. Hanmi handachiwaza – with uke standing and tori sitting. 

5. Tantodori – a defense movement against a knife. 

6. Tachidori – a defense movement against a sword. 

7. Jodori – a defense movement against a staff. 

8. Kaeshiwaza – which are counter techniques. 

9. Henkawaza – which are changed techniques. 

10. Kogeki – which are attack movements.   Once you have learnt the basics, you can interact what you’ve learnt into other forms of Aikido, so that you can train and adapt into any other dojo that you might visit. If you wish to progress through the levels of Aikido, it is good to learn more than the basics and how to put variations together. 

Principally, Aikido is the development of Ki, or energy/spirit, and a way to achieve harmony, or unification of mind and body. Teachers emphasise to basic elements to learning Aikido: (a) a commitment to resolution instead of conflict, whenever possible, and (b) self-improvement through training. They use the laws of physics, controlling your movement with skill, grace and timing, i.e. a slight shift in weight or position to move effortlessly, similar to dancing or skiing. 

For a ‘tori’, or attacker, and ‘uke’, or receiver, there are a range of principles to be learnt and followed. 

For a ‘tori’, they should always start with an evasive movement and blocking the attack is not necessary. Aikido is a non-confrontational art and although blocking can sometimes be practical, it should not be necessary, otherwise you are defeating the objective of Aikido, i.e. turning the attacker’s power back to them. Techniques should be done in such a way that it not only avoids the attacker, but also controls them. While learning the basics, movements should be performed in a low posture, which helps you learn balance and control. The techniques in Aikido should be united, i.e. the defense and the attack should not work against each other, but with each other. It may be tempting to use a strike, or ‘atemi’, technique, but these movements should be avoided. A tori must also be positioned so that he is able to defend any of the techniques from a ‘uke’, controlling the situation at all times and being aware of what is happening. 

For a ‘uke’, it is important that they have learnt the attack as much as the defense movements. Again, the movements should be performed in a low posture, developing balance and control, and they must not resist the technique on purpose as you may become more vulnerable to other techniques. Although the uke is the receiver, they must remain alert and keep the thought of attack in their mind. They must not change the direction of an attack during the technique, unless it is required in training. 
Styles of Aikido Over the years, as students left O Sensei’s teachings, they used their own interpretations of Aikido and developed differing styles. “Old School” styles were principally taught by O Sensei’s early students. ‘Aiki-Budo’ is very similar to the Jutsu forms of martial art and is probably one of the hardest styles to master. 

‘Yoseikan’ is an amalgamation of what he learnt from O Sensei and Jigaro-Kano Sensei at the Kodokan. This form of Aikido includes elements from Aiki-Budo, Judo and a range of other martial arts. 

‘Yoshinkan’ was taught by the late Gozo Shioda. It is harder style of martial art and focuses on the practicality, efficiency and physical techniques of Aikido. This form is principally taught within the Japanese Police branches. “Modern School” styles are principally variations of what is taught today by most senior students of O Sensei. 

“Traditional School” styles include Aikikai and Iwama-ryu. 

‘Aikikai’ is headed by Mariteru Ueshiba, the grandson of O Sensei, and is generally a more flowing form of Aikido, concentrating on the standard syllabus rather than on weapons training. However, some teachers of Aikikai do focus more on the weapons training aspect. 

‘Shinshin Toitsu Aikido’, taught by Koichi Tohei, is more about unifying the mind and body. He puts much more emphasis on the concept of Ki, learning to understand and developing this aspect, and applying it to daily life and health. This form involves softer movements, with ‘jumping’ or ‘skipping’ during the movement. 

‘Iwama-ryu’ is based in the Iwama Dojo, and has a much larger technical repertoire than most styles of Aikido. This form has a much bigger emphasis on the weapons training aspect, and is the style that is said to be the closest to that of O Sensei’s teaching.   “Sporting” styles were proposed by Konji Tomiki, who wanted to rationalise the training of Aikido by using Kata and Competition. 

‘Tomiki-ryu’ is a combination of O Sensei’s teachings and of the Judo founder, Jigaro Kano, and follows a similar theme as Judo which means it can be taught more easily, particularly in Japanese universities. Konji Tomiki believed that by introducing a competitive element into Aikido, it would sharpen the mind and help to focus the practice of Aikido. 
Equipment To learn Aikido, you don’t need any special equipment or clothing, although you may invest in a training uniform, simple black trousers and wraparound jacket which is principally white, at a later date. However, to start with, tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt are perfectly suitable (no footwear is worn during training). It is recommended that you remove all jewellery, earrings, nose or belly button studs, etc, or tape over any rings, for your own safety. 
Where to Learn There are many dojo (or schools) around the world that teach Aikido, as well as other martial arts. Search through your directory to find your nearest club, then go along and speak to a teacher, who will probably advise you to stay and watch other students practicing the art of Aikido. If you are still interested in learning Aikido, you can register to take part. There will be a weekly attendance fee to cover the cost of you training or participating in Aikido. 
Frequently Asked Questions Q: Do I need to be physically strong and fit? A: No. Aikido is not based on strength. It re-directs your opponents energy back, so you don’t need to be strong. As you learn Aikido as a martial art and control of your movements, your strength and physical ability will increase. 

Q: Do I need any special clothing or equipment? A: No. To start with, tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt is absolutely fine. If you progress through the grades, you may want to invest in a training uniform – simple trousers, usually black and a wraparound jacket, usually white. 

Q: Where can I find a local club? A: Aikido is practised throughout the world. Search your local directories, the internet or contact the Aikido Foundation. 

Q: Is there a minimum or maximum age to participate in Aikido? A: No. Aikido is a very flexible martial art, but would recommend that children are at least 5 years old before learning.",
Hiking,"Hiking Information  Hiking and Related Terms Hiking is one of the most beneficial and healthy hobbies anyone could choose to adopt. The fresh air and sun, aerobic walking, and up-close exposure to natural features such as streams, forests and mountainsides help to compensate for many of the physical and mental stresses or the work week. 

Hiking can be combined with an endless number of outdoor activities. It can be on trail or off; it can be done as day hikes or overnight backpacking. But hiking can also be paired with other activities, such as canoeing, kayaking, river rafting, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, or mountain climbing. It can be combined with horseback riding and/or with pack animals, such as llamas (which are considered earth-friendly, since their feet are softer on the trail than hooves). 
Backpacking Equipment First of all, one needs something to carry the equipment in. This can be simple fisherman`s jacket or a daypack for short hikes, or a full backpack. Next, consider which gear or equipment you’ll need for your particular trip. While hiking is considered different from backpacking (overnight camping), even for a day trip it is prudent to pack at least rudimentary items, should the unexpected happen (including being forced to stay the night, getting lost, or accidents). Hiking equipment may be put into several categories, such as items worn, items carried, essential gear, food and drink, and miscellaneous. 
Geocaching A new craze for hiking buffs is an activity called geocaching. Geocaching is an outdoor activity in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers (called ""geocaches"" or ""caches"") anywhere in the world. A typical cache is a small waterproof container (usually a Tupperware container or ammo box) containing a logbook. Larger containers can also contain items for trading, usually toys or trinkets of little value. Geocaching is most often described as a ""game of high-tech hide and seek,"" sharing many aspects with benchmarking, orienteering, treasure-hunting, letterboxing, and waymarking. Geocaches are currently placed in over 100 countries around the world and on all seven continents, including Antarctica. As of June 22, 2010, there are over 1,108,858 active geocaches around the world. If you access the Official Global GPS Cache Hunt Site online, you can participate in local searches by entering a zip code, or you can hunt in larger areas, nationally or internationally. There are organized geocaching events hosted internationally. And, since this aspect of the hobby uses new technology, there are GPS devices that come with pre-loaded geocache listings. And yes, there’s an iPhone application for that. 
Hiking with Your Dog A growing number of hikers will not consider hiking without their dogs. Many companies now specialize in the manufacture of dog-sized packs, collapsible bowls, and even booties for rough or cold terrain. The packs come in various sizes so that the dogs may carry their own food and/or bowls. If the dog is employed to carry food or supplies belonging to the human hikers, it is referred to as a storage dog, (not to be confused with a guide dog or service dog). Here are some tips for hiking with your canine best friend. First, have a good understanding of how much exercise your dog can handle. Some dogs tend to be only “sprinters,” and are best at the more level, pre-established trails. An hour or two (or even less) from start to finish may be all they can possibly handle. This is nothing to be ashamed of, especially if you remember that dogs were bred for different purposes. It is important to remember not to push your dog beyond its current ability level—you can always increase the distances with time. In fact, hiking is a great preventative for a number of physical and behavioral canine disorders. Have your veterinarian check your dog’s health before making any big changes in its activity level. 

Before your first hike, make sure your dog has a collar with identification tags (including one with your vet’s phone number). If you have a larger breed, don’t feel bad about having your dog wear a properly sized pack so he can carry his own supplies. You can your dog used to a pack by having him wear an empty one on short walks or around the house (with supervision). Add weight gradually, and don’t forget to include treats so your friend will begin to associate the pack with positive experiences and adventures. A rule of thumb is that a dog can comfortably carry 25% of its body weight. Don’t put anything breakable in the pack, and make sure everything inside it is sealed in plastic bags. Common contents of a dog pack are food, small amounts of water, and poop bags. If you’re bringing your dog along, it is especially important that you remember a first aid kit for your own pack (include a copy of your vet’s number). 

On the hike, take responsibility for what your dog does. Many hikers don’t like having to share the trail with dogs. You should always be a friendly ambassador for all dog owners while on a hike. Practice “low impact hiking,” mainly meaning 1) Don’t leave dog feces on the trail, 2) Only hike where dogs are allowed, 3) Stay on the trail, 4) Don’t allow your dog to chase wildlife, 5) Step off the trail and wait with your dog while other hikers pass, 6) Don’t allow your dog to bark at those who pass, and most important, 7) Always use a leash—this will keep everyone safe on the trail.",
Harmonica,"Harmonica Information  Intro The harmonica is a very enjoyable and versatile instrument. A lot of people take up playing the harmonica as a hobby and often end up playing professionally, either part time or full time – so, as you can see, it is a great skill to learn. There is, however, a tendency to give up too soon as there is a misconception that it is hard to learn to play the harmonica. But that is a myth, going by the number of people who really enjoy playing it, and when you learn it the right way, you too can have a lot of fun with this interesting instrument. 

The harmonica is a mouth instrument. It is pre tuned. Chords are also set up, so that when you blow, you get one chord and when you draw you get another. It is not difficult to learn to play a few simple songs quickly. Getting to the more complex pieces takes the requisite amount of practice and you need to develop a few particular skills when you learn. So let us get started. 
Basic Skills You Need To Play The Harmonica The basic skills you need to learn are breath control, tone control, tone production, single note technique, bending technique, the tongue blocking technique and to go with these, timing. Just master these, and you are more than half way there. It takes some dedicated practice, and because the instrument is easy to carry around, you can practice just about anywhere, so long as you make the time for it. Experts even suggest that when you play regularly, you probably handle the rest of your routine better because your breathing system is more under control. So that makes it two benefits in one skill for you! 
Types Of Harmonica Instruments To learn to play the harmonica, you need to know the types available so that you can eventually buy your own. Let us take a look at the different kinds of harmonicas:  
Diatonic, Blues Harps, Mouth Organs Or Harmonicas The most popular, these diatonic harmonicas have great tone and are portable. You can play them along with other instruments simultaneously. With these unique harmonicas, you can play the flats and sharps together by busing techniques like bending, over blowing and over drawing.  
Chromatic Harmonicas With chromatic harmonicas, the flats and sharps in a scale are played by combining button slide in and slide out. You can play in any key as ou have the complete 12-note octave with the sharps and flats. In each hole of the chromatic harmonica are four reeds of which two make natural notes and two chromatic. These are usually used in jazz and classical music, pop, blues and funk. Think Stevie Wonder to imagine some great chromatic harmonica playing.  
Tremolo And Echo Harmonicas These harmonicas have two rows of holes, unlike the diatonic and chromatic, which have a single row of holes. In the octave type, the upper row of holes is at a higher octave than the lower row of holes. Tremolos have the upper rows a little off tune so that you hear a vibrato like sound. In these harmonicas you don’t have to use techniques like bending and single note. 

So depending on which one you want to play, the options are many.  
The Best Harmonica To Buy That would naturally be your next thought. Which is the best harmonica to buy? Usually, you cannot try a harmonica before you buy it since it’s a mouth instrument. Different makes have different contours, so you’ll find that some seem like the perfect fit in your mouth. As a beginner your aim would be to get familiar with the instrument, learning to move and play on it, getting used to the sounds of blowing and drawing. Gradually you would get a good feel of the harmonica and be able to decide on the one that can suit your playing technique. 

You have a choice of 12 basic keys of harmonicas, although, as a beginner it is good to start with the basic ten hole harmonica in the key of C, which is a midrange harmonica. 

As far as diatonic harmonicas are considered, there are several excellent brands like Hohner, Lee Oskar, Hering, Suzuki, etc. 
Getting Started With Playing To be a good harmonica player, you need a good sense of rhythm, a sense of emotion and enjoy a style of music so that your personality comes through when you play. To get started, just hold your harmonica and try to run your mouth up and down it, getting a feel of blowing, drawing air and listening to the notes. You will see that while some holes are easy to play, some are not.  
Holding Your Harmonica The first thing to learn is how to hold your harmonica. You can hold it in your left hand, so that the numbers are facing up. Hole no.1 must be to the left. Next comes the mouth position, also called the ‘embouchure’. The right way is to make a complete seal with your lips touching the metal case. When you blow a few notes, you will know by the sound of the notes. Keep your mouth and jaw relaxed. You basically need to learn to play one note at a time and develop the skill. This is done with two techniques called lip blocking and tongue blocking. You must be careful not to over do the blowing and drawing. Then you will learn breath control. 

You must remember, as you learn, to diligently practice the easy songs that you are instructed to practice. This will help you play the tougher songs with ease. Instructors advise you to record yourself when you play so that you know how you sound when you play back. It is best to progress gradually. For example, in a new song, learn the notes first, then the rhythm, and so on. It is a good idea to use a metronome to maintain the beat. 

The best way to get really good at playing the harmonica is through practice. You might feel your lips feeling tired – but as you continue to play, the lip muscles will strengthen and you will develop the stamina to play longer.

Comic Books,"Comic Books InformationOVERVIEWThe popular appeal of comic books spans many generations. Those magazines capable of fueling childhood imaginations are also popular collector’s items for adults. Collecting comics is an enjoyable hobby that can lead to financial gain if the amassed comics increase in value. Many comic books appreciate in value based upon multiple factors, including availability of an issue, the physical condition of the book and the popularity of the series.Today’s comic books are as diverse as the collectors themselves. Topics found within the pages of comics include not only the thrilling adventures of superheroes like Batman and Wonder Woman, but also comedy, fantasy, horror, drama, mystery, crime and science-fiction. There are comic books targeted at both adults and youngsters.Popular Comic Book CharactersHere are some of the most beloved characters in comic books: Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Wonder Woman, Incredible Hulk, Captain America, X-Men, Hellboy, Wolverine, Iron Man, and FlashWHERE TO BUY COMIC BOOKSCollectors can choose from among many sources when looking to buy comic books. Newly released comics are sold at local comic book shops, book stores, convenience stores and even large department store chains. Older comics and vintage comics are available at online sites like eBay and Amazon, at local comic book shops and online comic book stores. Collectors can also search online for vintage comics at sites like craigslist, or attend comic book conventions, peruse the ads in their local newspapers or try their luck searching at garage sales and yard sales.Examining Vintage Comic BooksCollectors wishing to buy vintage comic books should watch for flaws that can lower the grade and value of the books. Experts suggest examining the cover and individual pages for wrinkles, rips, water spots or other imperfections.Look at the color of the pages. The extent of yellowing decreases the comics’ value. The staples in the spine should be present and in good condition. The spine should ideally be free of flaws and stress marks. Check the inside cover for publication information, including year, issue and volume. The comic book is a first edition if the inside cover does not state that it is a reprint.Be wary when checking out vintage comics. Some unscrupulous sellers will replace covers or try to sell less valuable reprints as first editions. Use caution when buying a vintage comic online from a private seller. Ask the seller to scan an image of the comic book so that you can study the condition. Obtain a guarantee of the comic book’s physical condition before paying.WHEN TO SELL COMIC BOOKSCollectors should keep updated about the ups and downs of the comic book market to gauge the best time to sell a collection or even just a magazine or two. Collectors should know what was paid for each comic in their collection and what each is currently valued at on the market. Collectors can choose from a variety of options when selling part or all of a collection. Local comic book shops will buy collections, but they will not pay full value because the shop owners want to reap a profit from their acquisitions. Some shops will pay only half of what a comic is worth. Thus online auction sites might prove to be a better alternative for the aficionado who wants to sell.Collectors should keep abreast of trends in the comic book market to help gauge what magazines will make the best investment and eventually rise in value. Keep on the lookout for new comics by popular artists and writers. Or watch for early creations by artists and writers who eventually became famous. Take note of debuting series that might prove popular and jump in value. Vintage titles in popular series like Batman, Spider-Man and Superman are good bets for appreciating in value. Publishers sometimes release titles with alternative or variant covers, which frequently lead to higher values in the speculator market. First issues in a series typically become hot sellers, provided the publisher did not saturate the market with too many copies. Other comics that might be expected to grow in value include first appearances by new characters and so-called crossover issues with special appearances by characters from other comics.How much a comic book gains in value over the years will vary greatly and will depend on many factors. The increase could be small or staggering. The first appearance of Superman is valued at approximately $500,000.Grading Comic BooksGrading is a vital step in buying or selling comics. Grading comics means judging their physical condition. Higher prices are paid for comics in good physical condition and with higher grades.Collectors can choose to have a company like the CGC, grade a comic. Or collectors may opt to grade their own comics rather than pay a company to do it. Honesty is needed in grading so that the resulting grade accurately mirrors the comic book’s physical quality.There are two main grading systems used for comic books. The grading system utilized by the CGC, uses a scale of numbers ranging from one to ten.The other main grading system uses the top grade of mint for comics.

Paragliding,"Paragliding Information  Introduction Paragliding is a frivolous and an aggressive airborne sport. A foot launched, free flying aircraft is called a paraglider. Below the fabric wing is a harness suspended where the pilot sits. The shape of it is formed by the suspension lines as well as the air pressure which enters into the front wing’s vent. 

Wishing to fly in the air like a bird is a dream of everyone. Paragliding is thus the most suitable mean to experience this and be at such a great height. It provides us an ideal channel to conquer the mighty high sky. It is an adventurous activity and is earning fame like a wild jungle fire.

Position of pilot: The pilot should sit flat in a harness. 

The range of speed (measured between maximum and stall speed) is slower in case of paraglider. This slower speed makes it easier to launch as well as fly in light winds but if the wind picks up it can cause trouble. Also, wind penetration is poor as well as does not pitch control. Although diving for speed is difficult, variations in pitch can still be achieved with the speed bar. 

Space needed for landing: a very small piece of space or land is needed to land. Make sure where you land there should not be any tree as it will be a big problem. 

Learning: are very easy to learn and most of the workouts are learned while doing practice i.e. it can’t be learned only by having oral guidance. So make sure while practising you should work out with an instructor with you in the air. 

Convenience: they are very much small in size. They are also very light in weigh and provide us with an advantage to carry it easily from one place to another. 

Cost: these paragliders are very cost effective but because of this are less durable.

a- How to land b- How to turn( in both sides) c- How to launch 

In order to know how to launch, move fast or run in the direction of the wind towards a slope with your aircraft behind you. It is known as “hopping”. When air with strike your aircraft it will give you a lift with then enables your paraglider to fly. When you are done with it to control direction, elevation and speed of your craft or paraglider make use of hand brakes. If you want to turn, pull the hand brake in that particular direction. In order to slow down your speed simultaneously pull both hand brakes. Look for suitable place to land and make a smooth landing. 

5- Once you are done with landing make sure you gather your equipments quickly so that if some other paraglider wants to land he or she can land with safety. After landing make your habit to pack your kite in order to shield it from harm full rays like ultraviolet rays.

7- Be patient. Make sure you are patient enough and don’t lose hope. Remember proper training along with practice will help you learn well. 
How to forward launch and land:
Forward Launching: • First you should check the paraglider position. For this, lay it on a horseshoe pattern such that the wings are facing into the wind. Make sure the body is facing forward when doing a forward launch. 

• Put your A riser in your arm and grab the brakes. After this, you will need to reach under and then back if you are so that A riser is placed in your palm. 

• Once gotten hold of risers, pull them. Once the correct position of brake as well as A risers is achieved, you will then pull of the A risers. Quickly take a glance backwards to ensure that everything is in correct position. 

• Now by taking half (or small step) back, forward launch. Remember you will need to take small step in order to perform forward launching. Start running with maximum speed with hips pulling forward. You will now be able to launch easily without having the need of high winds.  
Landing: • In order to land, you need to know how to do flare. Flare is a necessary technique and is done following a certain procedure. For flaring, you should make a hold of brakes in your hands and then pull brakes to your sides. Hold it in this position. This will allow the surface area of paraglider to be reducing, thus allowing it to descend. 

• The landing site should be pre-decided. Make sure the site has enough space to allow for you to land. You should also make sure to follow rules and regulations of the landing area,; if there are any. 

• When landing you should be facing the wind. Wind is an important factor in controlling the descending rate towards the ground and hence allows for a soft landing. 

• Landing should be done keeping specific procedure in mind. When you are 20 feet above the ground, you should hang out with legs together from harness. Your knees should be bending. Grab the brakes and when you are just 5 feet above the ground you should do flaring fast enough to minimize the paraglider. As soon as you hit the ground run a few steps. 

• You should quickly gather your paraglider in case there are other fliers who will be landing and so you need to clear out. You should also inspect your paraglider by laying it out in an open space for tears or snags. 
TIPS: • Always wear helmet, even if you are an expert or a beginner as injuries can occur anytime. 

• Wear strong light sturdy boots which provides good support to the ankle. 

• While purchasing paraglider makes sure you buy the best available quality as your life depends upon the paraglider you purchase. Any mishap during flight can put you in big trouble. Consult your instructor at the time of purchasing. Your life will depend on your paraglider, so ask your instructor what they recommend before you invest in your first purchase. 

• Keep your equipments in safe place. 

• Prefer to replace your old paraglider with the new after every 4 years. 

• Make sure you don’t have any breathing problem. If so consult a doctor whether you are eligible to paraglide or not. 

• While going for a flight make sure you are well equipped.

African Djembe,"African Djembe Information  Introduction The djembe (also spelled jembe) is an African drum that has gained popularity in the Western world over the last few decades.

These drums are simple to play, entertaining, attractive, and have a distinct cultural and historical heritage. They are relatively inexpensive when compared with traditional Western drum sets. Djembe drums can help reduce stress and are a good way to relax.

People young and old are forming drum circles and exploring world rhythms on the djembe and other traditional drums. 
Origins of the Djembe The djembe dates from the formation of the Mali Empire in West Africa in the 13th century. It originated with the Malinke (Mande, or Mandinka) and Susu peoples of what is today Mali and Guinea. While the djembe is believed to have been the invention of Mandinka blacksmiths known as “numu”, another story credits a woman with the invention of the drum. 

The woman was pounding millet into flour one day and broke through the bottom of her wooden mortar. She mounted a goat skin on the mortar, creating a crude drum. The curved goblet shape of the djembe’s body is similar to the mortars traditionally used by African women.
  Traditionally, certain instruments were restricted to certain social classes. The jeli, or professional musicians, were the only people who could play certain drums such as the kora, ngoni, and bala. The djembe, however, could be played by anyone. Most of the famous djembe players came from the Numu class or from the nobility. As the Numu migrated through West Africa, they took the djembe with them, and the drum is now associated with many West African countries.   The djembe was introduced to the West in the early 1950s by Les Ballet Africains a touring ballet company headed by Guinean Fodeba Keita. Ten years later, Ladji Camara, a lead drummer from Les Ballet Africains, relocated to the United States and helped create a widespread interest in the djembe and African drum music. 

The djembe experienced another massive surge in popularity in late 1980, when Guinea president Seckou Toure died. At that time, ballet troupes from Guinea, as well as Mali and Senegal, began to migrate to western countries to teach and perform. 

Another factor in the rising popularity of the djembe is the world music boom, which began in the late 1980s and continues strong today. Many djembe-based groups, such as Fatala from Guinea and Farafina from Burkina Faso, have popularized the interest. 

In addition, there has been strong interest in the djembe and other African drums, as well as other aspects of African culture, by public school systems throughout the United States. Schools in many larger cities, such as New York and Chicago, have offered drumming classes and workshops. In addition, the Chicago Djembe Project offers African drumming classes and drumming circles for kids, teens, and adults alike. 

Unfortunately, this mass interest in the djembe has not generally been accompanied by accurate information on its traditional use in its African homeland. Many fans of the djembe know little about settings and occasions where the djembe is played, who plays it, types of ensembles in which it is played, and other basic information on the role of the djembe in African culture. Most non-native djembe players have never visited Africa, or have spent very little time there. And, since many native African djembe players speak only native African languages and French, it is difficult for them to communicate with English-speaking people. If you are considering taking up the djembe, or if you are interested exploring its African roots, there is still much research to be done on this instrument.  
Traditional Djembe Playing Traditionally, the djembe was played for village ceremonies and gatherings, such as weddings, festivals, and holidays. There were various djembe rhythms, corresponding to dances, and each had its particular purpose, time, and place. Some honored groups of people; others were associated with specific occasions such as a circumcision or planting. A village drumming event usually lasts several hours, with the drummers and dancers concentrating on a few dances and rhythms. Everyone present dances, and there is natural flow to the dancing, alternating between fast, energetic rhythms and slower, easier rhythms accompanied by singing, where the dancers can rest and catch their breath. 

Many of the djembe dances were played by groups of players, usually with a larger bass djembe, a solo djembe, and sometimes other higher pitched djembes. Each djembe played a different rhythm and followed a call-and-response pattern. Some of these dances include the Kuku, the Diansa, and the Triba. 

The Kuku was originally a circle dance for women, celebrating the return of their men from fishing. Today, it is used for celebrations of all types. It has a 4/4 rhythm and was played by the Malinke people around the Ivory Coast. The rhythm was played by a bass djembe and a single large solo djembe. 

The Diansa originated in southern Mali and was a competition dance for young men. Now it is a popular rhythm played all over West Africa. In earlier days, only two bass djembe drums were used, but a third drum pattern was added later. The time signature of the Diansa is also 4/4. 

The Triba is from the Laduma people in the west of Guinea. Originally, it was a dance done by a single costumed dancer accompanied by a group of percussionists. While this dance is no longer danced, the rhythm is played often for various special occasions, such as initiations. One such event is a mother-daughter dance, done to celebrate a girl becoming a woman. The rhythm of this dance is ternary, in 6/8 time. 
How To Play The Djembe If you want to learn to play the djembe, there are many resources available both on the Web, at music stores, and in your local community. CDs from master players, instructional DVDs, online-based playing communities, and local drumming circles are only a few. If you haven’t found a drumming community yet, here are some basic tips to get you started on your own.  
Holding The Djembe The djembe is basically a large, hollowed wooden goblet with a drumhead attached at the top. In order for the drum to resonate, the hollow base must be tilted away from the floor. Most players sit in a chair, holding the djembe between their legs and gripping it with their thighs, with the drumhead pointing away from the body and the base tilted under the chair. The hands should be in a comfortable position, parallel to the top of the drum and pointing slightly inwards.  
Producing Sounds On The Djembe The djembe has three basic sounds—the bass, the tone, and the slap. 

The bass sound carries the rhythm and it is played in the center of the drum, with a slightly cupped hand. The tone has a higher pitch, and is played by striking the edge of the drum with the fleshy part of the palm and the hand held flat. The slap is the highest pitched sound and the most difficult to play. The player must tap the rim of the drum with a cupped hand and relaxed fingers. 

The tone must ring by striking like it`s a hot pan. Beginners may think of the tone and slap as fingers ""together"" and ""apart."" Advanced players will not take the time to make that obvious physical change but will rather make a less visibly obvious change from ""focused"" to ""dispersed."" 

Begin by sitting comfortably, with hands and arms relaxed. Start by learning to play a steady beat using both hands, striking the center and outside edges of the drum. When you can do this easily, you then can start to vary the beat, adding long and short beats and syncopations. Now you are ready to begin making your drum sing by learning its three basic sounds.  
The Three Basic Sounds The three basic sounds on the djembe are all open tones: after you hit the skin, your hand should bounce back, allowing the note to ring. Keeping the hand in contact with the skin will produce a different sound, and is usually done as an advanced technique. As a beginning player, you should master the three basic tones first. The following are some basic guidelines for playing the basic tones of the djembe: 

• Bass: The bass tone keeps the rhythm, and is played in the center of the djembe. Some players prefer to keep each hand slightly positioned toward its own side of an imaginary center line down the middle of the drum. Sometimes the bass is played slightly toward the rim of the djembe, producing a sound that is not as deep, but easier to play at high speeds since the hand has less distance to travel between the bass and the other tones. 

• Tone: The tone is played with the underside of the fingers. Your hand should be placed with the joint where the fingers join the hand placed around the rim of the drum. Hit the drum skin flat, with all the fingers hitting simultaneously. Think of your hand as a straight extension of the arm, and play like you are about to do a judo chop. You should aim for a firm, solid, “thud”-like sound that produces a ringing tone. When first learning, keep the fingers together to produce the fullest and clearest tone. 

• Slap: The slap is the hardest sound for beginners to do successfully. To do the slap, relax your hand and arm and hit the drum with a sharp slap. Your hand is in a position similar to that used for the tone. Hit the rim of the drum with the very edge of the padded part of your hand, just below the wrist. Fingers should be turned in slightly. Even though the hand appears to be more curved, the slap is played with the same hand position as the tone. The fingers should curl naturally, with only the tips hitting the drum, and bounce naturally off the skin. Help the bounce along by slightly lifting the hand from the drum immediately after hitting the skin. 

Keep the hand position of the tone and the slap as close together as possible. This allows you to move between the two notes quickly and easily. When you are playing, there should be a strong, clear distinction between the tone and the slap. Spend extra time working on these techniques so that they can be played clearly at high speeds.  
Posture Start slower, aiming for sound quality over speed. Speed will develop naturally over time. It is also important to pay attention to your posture. Keep the body upright but relaxed, with a straight spine and loose arms. Your arms should hang naturally down your sides, and all the movement should be from your elbows, not your shoulders.  
The Most Important Thing Of All When learning to play the djembe, don’t forget the most important thing of all. Relax and enjoy yourself. Pay attention to the rhythms that come from your heart, not your head. You are not just beating on a drum; you are letting the drum speak through you. 
Playing Tips for Beginners • Keep A Steady Beat. The drum is a rhythm instrument. The most important thing you can learn with drumming is to maintain a steady, consistent beat. Start slowly and build up speed, but first and foremost, always aim for accuracy and precision in your timing. 

• Start Slowly. This cannot be repeated enough. Start at a slow, comfortable pace, and aim at producing clear, distinct sounds. You should hear the difference between the bass, the tone, and the slap. When you can play a steady rhythm at a comfortable speed, then practice slowly speeding up, until you can playing at the tempo of other musicians around you. 

• Listen To Other Musicians. There are many resources available on the Internet and at local music stores. Listen to CDs, YouTube videos, and teaching DVDs. Find some local drummers and attend their drum circles, just to listen. 

• Play In A Group. When you have learned the basics, find a drum circle or a music session in your area and join in. Be sure to listen carefully to what the other musicians are doing, and make sure your playing fits the tone and rhythm established by the group. Your goal is to enhance the overall quality of the music being played, not to stand out like a sore thumb.  
Common Playing Mistakes Here some common mistakes beginners often make: 

• Sore thumbs. This is caused by playing too far to the center of the drum, and striking the thumb with the other hand. 

• Playing with the hands too parallel. Be sure to point your hands slightly inwards. If your hands are too stiffly parallel to the drum, your wrist will rotate, causing strain on the wrist and forearm, eventually leading to carpal tunnel syndrome. 

• Hitting too hard. Especially when making a slap, there is a tendency for beginners to hit too hard. The volume and sound of the slap comes from the action of the wrist, not the force of the hit. You do not have to hit harder to produce a slap; the whipping sound should occur naturally.    
Tuning The Djembe You might think that, since a drum does not have strings, it does not need to be tuned. However, humidity and changes in temperature can make a drum head go slack and sound dead. Djembe drums are tuned by pulling the ropes tightly so that the metal rings bring the skin down over the drum shell evenly. 
What To Look For In Buying A Djembe
Choosing A Djembe There are many types of djembes available on the market, with prices ranging from $49 to $300 and over. The cheapest drums are manufactured, with plastic bodies and Western-style screw-mounted drumheads. The advantage to this drum is its low cost and the ease with which the drumhead can be replaced by any music store. In addition, you can easily tune the drumhead yourself simply by tightening the screws that attach it to the body. These drums have a lighter, ringing tone. 

Wooden djembes are a good choice if you want a traditional African-looking drum with a warm, mellow, earthy sound. These drums are much more expensive, and many of them are imported from Africa. They feature hand-carved bodies, native designs, and have drum heads mounted in the traditional way, with ropes. These heads are tuned by tightening the ropes, a process involving some degree of skill and training. If the drum head breaks, it will be more difficult and costly to replace. On the other hand, the beautiful, warm tone of these drums and the traditional, hand-carved designs on the wooden body make these instruments decorative as well as functional. Look for a drum made from solid, seasoned wood—the harder the better. The wood should be free of cracks or holes. Often, the insects that have bored holes in the wood may still be present and can infest other wood in your home.  
Where To Buy A Djembe Since the djembe has become a very popular instrument, you might consider visiting your local music store. Chances are they may have a selection of drums for you to try out. There is nothing like being able to hold and actually play the instrument you are purchasing. In addition, there are many resources available on the Web and many websites that carry the djembe and other African drums. Prices for these drums can range from $50 to $300.  
Make Sure Your Drum Is Earth-Friendly Many West African forests are being destroyed by aggressive logging practices aimed at producing quick profits at the expense of local ecosystems. Approximately 20 percent of West African forests have now been destroyed by poor management, illegal forestation, and a desire for short-term gains. Some buyers are concerned with the source of the woods used for djembe drums. A number of major retailers are now choosing to use suppliers in countries such as Bali and Indonesia, where the government regulates forestation. You might consider choosing a company that offers fair trade drums. 
Where Can I Get Lessons, Resources, Classes, Etc? For the aspiring djembe player, there are many resources available. The Internet is a good first stop. Type “djembe” into your search engine and you will find many sites from which to choose. Or, scroll down this web page and check out the sources listed here. Many sites offer video tutorials to help you get started. 

Local music stores now carry a selection of world musical instruments. Check out the stores near you. Many of these stores may carry books or offer lessons. 

Books are also available online, through Amazon and other websites. 

And finally, don’t forget to look for local resources in your community. Especially if you live in a large city, there may be drumming circles and local interest groups. As an aspiring musician, be on the lookout for other players and groups where you can bring your instrument and join in. While there are solo djembe players, the djembe, as well as other African instruments, are communal instruments. Traditional African music was not played in concert halls for well-mannered, polite (and half-asleep) audiences. It was played by and for groups of people dancing and making music together. Tradition teaches that each drum has its own spirit, and that spirit is best expressed in a musical community. 
Conclusion It has been said that the West African djembe is to the new millennium what the acoustic guitar was to the 1960s, a simple, portable, low-tech instrument that can be played for enjoyment in groups. It is played in public parks, on mountaintops and beside streams, and in dorm rooms and night clubs. It can be found on sale throughout the world, on almost every continent. Drumming is a basic form of human communication that spans cultural, social, and language barriers and brings people together in a common community. For a small expense and with a little practice, you, too, can join this community.",
Puppetry,"Puppetry Information  An introduction If the idea of being a performer appeals to you, consider puppetry. Puppetry is fun and has been used in communication for decades to convey ideas. This is an ancient art that has existed even before live theater and mime. Puppetry is a great way for shy people to take that step forward as theater performers because while they enjoy the excitement of the performance, the audience focuses on the puppet show. Puppeteers usually love to perform and entertain people. Being creative, and easily adaptable to changing situations, puppeteers are also self-confident with great hand-eye coordination and a perfect sense of timing. 

Here is a detailed look at the concept of puppetry, its history, and types of puppets and how you can get started with this fun hobby, followed by tips to take you ahead. 
What is puppetry? Puppetry is a form of theatre or performance which involves the manipulation of puppets. Puppetry takes many forms but they all share the process of animating performing objects. Most puppetry involves storytelling. 
Getting started with puppetry Taking up puppetry as a hobby can be very fulfilling. You might even end up earning a living by doing it consistently. There are many ways to learn this wonderful art. You can take up a course at any one of the numerous schools or universities that offer them. It is possible to get a degree in Puppetry Arts through regular classes or distance education, if you become serious about pursuing this hobby. These structured courses teach you everything you need to know about puppetry. 

You can also find someone who is already a puppeteer and make them your mentor. When you have the guidance of an experienced puppeteer, you can learn the basic skills quickly. You will also have the advantage of making fewer mistakes and learning much faster than you would, if you were to attend a course. There are several books that provide tips and practice routines related to puppetry and how to make puppets. Online courses that give you basic information are worth checking out, as they also provide you with advice about how to manage your hobby. 

As a puppeteer you need to be a reasonably good actor, writer and storyteller. You would certainly need a good sense of comic timing, good health, focus and stamina, as performances can sometimes be strenuous. Puppeteers view their puppets as real personalities rather than something they use in their performance. With your multiple talents, you can be a puppeteer who performs live, on TV, at the theatre and at events. 

Being a puppeteer takes plenty of preparation, planning and training and sometimes involves long hours. When you take up puppetry as a hobby, you will also need to do some studying and practice new routines. Most puppeteers work part time as well as full time. You can get together with a theatre group or work on movie sets and TV shows where puppets are used. Some puppeteers also perform touring across cities. After you get started, and learn the basics, you can enjoy performing at children’s parties, small shows at hotels, etc. Some puppeteers also perform as part of a group. 
Making hand puppets You’ve probably played with puppets as a child. If you enjoyed bringing things to life with your imagination, this is your chance to follow your passion. To get you started with simple puppets, here’s a quick guide about how to make some easy hand puppets. The supplies are easy to put together. You will need a couple of sheets of craft or construction paper of two different colors, glue, scissors, a pencil, markers or color crayons, some embellishments like ribbons, pom-poms, some scraps of fabric, eyes, buttons, etc. You can use one sheet for the puppet’s face. Fold the sheet in half from top to bottom. Then unfold it and apply glue along the top edge and side edges. Do not apply glue along the bottom edge as this must be open to insert your hand. Now fold the paper again and stick the top and side edges. With your crayons and markers, create your puppet’s face and give it character. Use the embellishments to decorate it. Allow it to dry completely. Build a story around it, and get your friends together for a show! 

You can also use stuffed toys as puppets to practice with. Soon you will be able to put on a quality show that will grab your viewers’ attention and you will see them enjoy watching your puppets come to life. 

As you can see, getting started need not cost you much. You can begin by using whatever you have available at home. It could be old newspapers, old clothes, or just about anything you can build a story around. Your main investment in becoming a good puppeteer will be time. 
Ventriloquist puppets If you are familiar with ventriloquism, you can also enjoy being a ventriloquist puppeteer. Ventriloquists throw their voices around to make it appear as though it is the puppet talking, not them. This takes time to master. 

You can train yourself by playing with a few voices you can come up with. Pick a puppet that makes you feel at ease. This could be a hand puppet or stuffed toy. Work on the character you plan to portray. The main thing is to practice your voices. You need to be able to sustain a conversation with different voices and this will need stamina. Expert ventriloquists do this with their mouths closed. Work on your pronunciation. According to accomplished ventriloquists, consonants like P and B are the toughest. Therefore, you need to practice well, so that you can throw your voice around without opening your mouth or moving your lips. 

After you develop the expertise, develop a routine and add in the jokes that will make your audience laugh till their bellies ache. 
Designing and building your puppet Puppetry is a hobby that involves a lot of creativity and therefore, there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to designing your puppet. But here are some questions whose answers will help you do it better: 

What do you want your puppet to do? 

This is the first question to answer. You may need to get a script or storyboard ready since it will help you decide your movements and sequence of actions. Other questions to think about are - Do you want your puppet to speak? Does it need limbs? Your act may only need the top half of a puppet. Based on the theme of your performance, try and think about everything your puppet needs to do and prepare. You can make your act unique and interesting by being different. 

What type of puppet would suit your personality? 

There are many types of puppets. Decide which type of puppet would be good for you. Would you prefer a rod puppet or a muppet? Would a marionette, glove puppet or finger puppet suit you better? Get all the information you need, to make the right choice. You can create your own puppet out of anything. 

How will your puppet operate? 

After you decide on the type of puppet and what you want it to do, you would need to decide how it will operate. It needs a mechanism to do what it is expected to do. This must be easy for you to handle. The puppet must be the right size. If you are left handed, the puppet must be convenient for you to work with. 

What material do you need? 

Depending on the kind of puppet you plan to use, you will need to consider its weight, its looks, colors, texture, gender, age, character, etc. Make sure what you use is safe. 

What is your budget? 

You can create a puppet no matter how small your budget. Shop around for what you want. Whenever you see something that is likely to be useful, buy it. Collect what you are likely to use. Get durable material and tools. 

Do you need any templates, sketches or samples? 

If you are going to use a puppet, it is worthwhile to know how to make it because you are going to operate it. This will help you set it right in case you have a problem. 

What about repairs? 

Be prepared to carry out repairs when your puppet wears off. Find out where you can find the necessary material quickly to do this, so that your performance does not face a hitch. It is a good idea to keep some a spare parts ready in a repair kit that you can easily access when you need it. 

Preparing yourself 

To be a good puppeteer, you need plenty of energy to wield your puppet. Preferably choose a puppet that’s easy to handle and not too heavy, as it can get tiring. Practice the movements you need to make with the puppet. You may need to get a stand to place your puppet on, when you need to take a break during your act, especially if it is a long show. 

Small puppets are easy to manage. You also need to think of storage options for your puppets to keep them free from dust before and after your show. If you use marionettes, you need to hang them up to avoid them getting tangled. Label all your storage containers since it will make it easier for you to find things. 

Also, think about the stage, the props you plan to use and the lighting. You can also paint your puppet in neon colors or have a backlit theater. It all depends on what your show’s all about. 

What about your workspace? 

Mark out a place to work on your puppets and to store all your material. Make sure you have adequate ventilation as this is important when you use glues and paints, varnishes and woodwork. If you use special machinery, you will need a proper workshop with equipment that involves maintenance. If you have children or pets at home, keep them away from your tools. 

Are you planning to work alone or with a partner? 

As a puppeteer, you can hold an act on your own, or do it with a partner. The partner could be your friend, son or daughter. Depending on who you are planning to work with you will need to decide on the details and coordinate before you rehearse. 

Building a puppet is a joy and you can create the puppet from your imagination. Learn to improvise along the act. If you get an idea that is not in the script, go ahead and introduce it. Practice will make you confident and perfect. 

There are books that provide you the basics of puppets along with tips about how to build them, techniques you can use, ideas for setting up your stage, lighting tips, etc. with illustrated examples. 
Tips on planning a puppet show These tips apply whether you plan to work with children or adults. 

• Young children can usually only manage one puppet while older children might be able to handle two. So you will need to choose accordingly. 

• Before you put on a show, rehearse without the puppets, working on your expression and acting. You need to practice the dialogs and projection. You have to know the lines by rote and the sequence at which it must be said. Only then does it become easy to improvise. 

• You may think of using a narrator to tell the story in between dialogs during the show. This can help link scenes and tell the audience what is happening. Your narrator can be visible to the audience or even stay backstage. 

• If you are working with young children you may want the entire puppet show to be narrated. 

• Break your show into ten or fifteen minute acts to make it more interesting to the audience. 
In closing Puppetry can start as a hobby and easily turn into a full time vocation if you become passionate about it. You might even have the opportunity to become an instructor at a puppetry class or camp. It’s a great route to becoming an actor, puppet designer or an animator. But to discover the fun of puppetry, you don’t really have to turn it into a career, although that’s exciting too. Making puppets and presenting them as a group or as a family show can be a wonderful experience and a great way to spend quality time together.",
Bowling,"Bowling Information  Introduction Bowling is a sports activity in which the player rolls a bowling ball, in an attempt to score points and get the ball close to a target ball or into pins, on a flat surface. Typically, the flat surface is made up of synthetic or wooden surface. 

In the past, bowling and the bowling balls existed only in primitive forms which were discovered by the archeologists. At present, bowling exists in a lot of forms, the recent most being the ten-pin bowling. 

Bowling, nowadays, is popular all over the world. The popularity of this activity can be judged by the fact that almost every other mall, recreation grounds or other social settings have a bowling area. 

The sport of bowling requires precision from the way how you position your body to the way the slots in bowling surface are targeted. In order to achieve precision, one needs to have the necessary tools as well accessories which are required in order to be a part of this amazing and fun filled game. 

Getting a bowling ball to perfectly roll as well as hit the target opens up a whole new avenue of getting yourself fully into the game and enjoys it. Getting the perfect roll depends on a number of factors such as the bowling ball weight, how it feels when you are holding it, its texture, whether you are comfortable with throwing it or not (especially when approach the line of foul). 
History Bowling is not only one of the most popular games around the world but also one of the oldest as well. It can be traced back to circa 3200 BC. In 1930, Sir Flinders Petrie, a British anthropologist discovered objects in an Egyptian child’s grave, which seemed to have been used as bowling in primitive form. This was basically an outlined rough version of the bowling ball that we see today and had pins along with it, all having a size to fit a child’s need. The grave and objects were dated back to 3200 BC which means that bowling existed more than 5000 years as well.   It is believed that King Edward III banned bowling because the troops were drawn towards it and instead of practicing archery, focused on bowling more. The game revived when Henry VIII took charge and unbanned it. This led to the emergence of different types of pin games in which ball was rolled towards objects in order to score. These objects were like pin in shape but crude version of design and shape that exists today. This shows how much rich and deep is the history of bowling. Nowadays, you will find a lot of games which resembles the modern bowling for instance, you will find in Europe the nine pin variations or Petanque in France. Bocce balls have its origin in Italy and are very much similar to lawn bowling in British. Both the English as well as the Dutch brought their version of bowling in United States. The word bowling was for the first time heard in America when it was mentioned in the book ‘Rip Van Winkle, a famous story by Washington Irving, who gets woken up by the sound of ""crashing ninepins"", published in 1812. 

From here the history of bowling History continued in America. A permanent site for bowling was designed in the heart of the battery area in New York. It is now recognized by the name of Bowling Green, located in the what is now recognized as financial district. Bowling has gained immense popularity in America and has become one of those big games where betting is done. In 1841, Connecticut banned bowling but due to its popularity the ban was uplifted. 

In 1800s, ten pin games became a lot of popular amongst many for the reason that nine pin was banned and considered to be a gambling game. By simply adding an extra pin, people were able to exploit a loophole in the law and were able to still enjoy the sport of bowling. The formation of the pins as well as ball still saw variations in the region. In 1895, a number of bowling clubs from different region got together and under the leadership of a restaurant owner formed the American Bowling Congress in New York City at Beethoven hall. This led to consistency in the game of bowling as well as national competition were held. The drawback of the Congress was that it was only for men. From late ninetieth century women had been bowling as well and thus women formed Women’s National Bowling Association in 1917 on their own and for themselves. This really led to standardization of the game and bowling received a major boost from here onwards. The game became more and more popular from here and all over America. 

The fifties is known as the decade of bowling but in reality the popularity of bowling is growing and people are much fond of it as people in the past used to be. It is estimated that around Ninety five million people across ninety countries are still involved in this sport with the number of people as well as the bowling clubs increasing. 

The history of bowling doesn’t end here, it still continues. New technologies in the game of bowling continue to be seen from bowling ball to electronic scores and monitor showing the path of speed of the ball as well as many other things. 

The growth in bowling seems not to be ending- at least not any time sooner. 
Health benefits Bowling is not just an activity of having fun, but it also have numerous health benefits. It is considered to an anaerobic exercise for the physical fitness, just like walking with free weights. The activity of bowling allows the bowler to burn a lot of calories. It also works on those muscle groups which are not usually exercised and taken care of. Bowling involves a lot of flexing and stretching. This allows working on tendons, ligaments, arm muscles and joints which leads to weight loss- a common desire of most of us today. 

Not only does bowling give physical benefits but it also has an effect on psychosocial behavior. With so many people in one place, having so much fun, laughing, watching each other bowl, commenting and doing so much more, it is easier to strengthen friendship as well as create new bonds. 
Bowling safety • Warming up is very much important in bowling as well. Remember, bowling is a physical activity and it is strongly recommended to warm up before performing any such activity. Warming up is necessary if you want to avoid injuries from occurring. • Warming up of fingers is also really important since fingers are to be inserted in the bowling ball. This will make sure that the fingers are not left stuck in the ball • Make sure there are no sticky objects on the sole of the shoes as it may cause you to fall. • Bowling balls are quite heavy to pick up, with weights varying with different ranges. Hence, in order to avoid wrist injury or back problem you should pick the bowling ball with both the hands. It is advisable that you should also bend your knees when picking up the bowl if you don’t want to have a back injury. • The return mechanism of bowling ball has a driven wheel. Make sure you keep your hands away from it. 
Keeping bowling scores Most of the bowling alleys that you visit will have electronic score but still getting to know how to keep track of the scoring is a good thing. You should know each and every thing about the game you love and besides no one knows when a need may arise so here is how you can keep bowling scores: 

• You should first know the basics of the game. Keep in mind that a game of bowling is divided into 10 frames. A bowler will get two chances in each frame to allow him to knock down all the pins. • Get yourself a score sheet and note down the name of the bowlers in a provided space. • You should note down the number of pins which were knocked down by the bowler in his first attempt. • Make sure you write down the figure in front of the respective bowler, in a small space which is at the top left corner in the box allocated to that frame. • Now record the pin numbers which were knocked down by the bowler on his second attempt. It should be noted down in a small box as well, which will be next to first box (in which you recorded the first attempt). • Now add the two numbers and pen it down in the blank space below (the ‘total’ area • If a bowler scores a strike, then put an X in the frame. • In the next attempt, 10 points for strike plus number of pins knocked down in that turn. Record this result in the total area of the frame in which the bowler scored a strike. As usual after the strike now score the frame. • If the next attempt is again a strike, then you should add 10 points (first strike), 10 points for next strike and the number of pins which were knocked down in the first attempt of the next frame. • When the bowler throws and knocks down all the pins in his second attempt then put a spare like this (""/"") in the box. Now on his next turn, you should add 10 points to the spare with the number of pins which were knocked down in the next attempt he made. Remember to record this in the total area of the frame in which a spare was scored. • At the end of the game, simply add up all the scores of each player and see who won the game. 
Tips Given are some really useful tips for you which may help you in improving your bowling: 

• Roll: Make sure you are rolling the ball and not throw it as if you are throwing a stone. Rolling of bowling ball should be along the lane. Also, make sure you roll smoothly even from the start. No typical clonk sound should be heard which almost all beginners will hear when they start. • Keep focused on pin: When rolling the ball, make sure your eyes are on the pin and not on the bowling ball. • Practice a lot: If you really want to improve then you need to practice a lot. You should at least try and practice a couple of times in a week. If this is not possible for you then at least you should practice once a week. Remember the more you practice, the better it will be. You can also improve your bowling skills by getting membership of a club where there are skilled people who will let you in on their secrets and will teach you. You will also find other beginners to play with. • Observing pros: You should keep a close eye on the bowling experts and how they move. You can watch tournaments on TV and may even record them so that you can watch closely, in a slow motion, the movements of the pros. • Shoes: You should pay attention to your shoes and make sure that that you clean them regularly especially the shoe’s sole. You can also brush them so that not much will slide. 
Conclusion: Today bowling is one of the most popular and best activities out there. Everyone just loves to do bowling and have so much fun doing it. You will not only enjoy yourself but will also be able to spend quality time with friends and family, having a little friendly competition along the way. 

Remember if you really want to win a game, you need to improve your skills for which you will really need to practice a lot. You can also pick up with few bowling tips along the way and become a better bowler and aw your friends. 

Go out and enjoy yourself with an exciting, fun-filled game of bowling.",
RC Helicopters,"RC Helicopters Information  Introduction RC Helicopters is a hobby that provides a way to relax, relieve stress and just have fun. Construction and flying your own radio-controlled helicopter is both a challenging as well as rewarding hobby for people of all ages. 

It is important to understand that RC helicopters are not toys. Radio-controlled helicopters are actually very sophisticated machines. As a RC helicopter hobbyist or pilot, you must have the technical aptitude to build and prepare your helicopter, responsibility to follow the safety rules for RC helicopter operation as well as the patience to take the time to learn to fly your RC helicopter properly. Radio-controlled helicopters (also RC helicopters) are model aircraft, which are distinct from RC airplanes because of the differences in construction, aerodynamics, and flight training. 

There are many different brands and types of radio-controlled helicopters. All helicopters generate directional control and lift through one or more primary rotors. With that being said, there are several different variations of this pattern, both in power source and design. 
RC Helicopter Power Sources Common power sources are nitro (nitro methane-methanol internal combustion), electric batteries, gas turbines, petrol and gasoline. 

Batteries are used to power electric helicopters. The less costly models use NiMH batteries and the more expensive variations are powered by lithium polymer batteries. Lithium polymer batteries are not as heavy as NiMH batteries that offer equal amounts of power. However, lithium polymer batteries require a special charger to prevent possible explosion. In addition, you must not overcharge lithium polymer batteries, which can result in permanent damage. 

Electric RC helicopters are practically noiseless. However, as the size of the RC helicopter increases, so does the price of the batteries required to operate the machine. It takes roughly an hour to recharge your RC helicopter batteries. If you intend to fly on a regular basis, you may want to invest in at least one or two extra battery packs. 

Liquid fuel composed of oil for lubrication as well as nitro methane and methanol for power is used to run nitro powered RC helicopters. This type of radio-controlled helicopter is generally much larger and louder than electric powered helicopters. In addition, you can fly your nitro helicopter virtually nonstop because it is incredibly easy to refill your fuel tank and keep flying. 

Many hobbyists prefer this to waiting for the batteries to recharge on an electric RC helicopter. The cost of the fuel to power your nitro helicopter is relatively inexpensive in comparison to the money that you have to spend upfront on lithium polymer battery packs. The only catch is that you have to keep buying fuel to refill your tank. 

A few of the larger RC helicopters are powered by a gas turbine engine or two-stroke petrol engine. Unless you are an expert hobbyist, this is not the RC helicopter for you. Operation of these machines should only be attempted by the most skilled and advanced RC helicopter pilots. Avoid retailers who unwittingly advertise nitro helicopters as gas powered. 
RC Helicopter Designs The various designs for RC helicopters include toy electric, electric coaxial, electric fixed pitch and collective pitch. 

Toy RC helicopters are helicopters without full directional control. This means that it does not have a swashplate. Toy radio controlled helicopters are great for beginner flyers because they are so robust. However the time that you spend learning how to fly these toys essentially will not enhance your skills to pilot the more advanced machines. In addition, spare parts for toy helicopters are generally not readily available. If you damage your helicopter in a crash, you will have a tough time trying to find everything you need to get it back in action. 

On a coaxial RC helicopter, there are two rotors on a common axial with one mounted above the other. These rotors move in opposite directions of each other. This cancels out the torque reaction of each rotor; therefore, no tail rotor is required. 

Electric coaxial RC helicopters are built to be self-stabilizing. When it is properly trimmed, these helicopters will return to somewhat of a hover if the pilot stops imputing controls. Electric coaxial RC helicopters are relatively robust and inexpensive. This type of radio-controlled helicopter is especially ideal for the pilot who does not want to take the time to learn how to fly a conventional helicopter. Electric coaxial RC helicopters are perfect for someone who has no helicopter experience at all and the controls are similar to those of the larger helicopters. 

If you plan to fly your RC helicopter indoors, electric coaxial RC helicopters are ideal because they only weigh about two to nine ounces. In addition, these helicopters are also great for flying outside when conditions are still. The damage that occurs during a crash is limited because only a low amount of energy is stored in the spinning rotor blades. 

Generally, helicopters that do not feature collective pitch control are referred to as fixed pitch. The main rotor turns faster or slower to achieve vertical control, this generates more or less lift. Normally, coaxial RC helicopters are fixed pitch. 

Typically, a fixed pitch helicopter has a single primary rotor as well as a small tail rotor to achieve anti-torque control. Only a few parts on a fixed pitch helicopter actually move. Even though fixed pitch helicopters are lightweight, at only two to ten ounces, they are quite tough in a crash, just as long as you close the throttle before it crashes. Fixed pitch helicopters can be flown indoors or outdoors in a light breeze of less than three miles per hour. 

If you are working your way up to a collective pitch helicopter, a fixed pitch helicopter is just the thing. Since collective pitch helicopters require a substantial amount of practice to master flying, but are expensive to purchase and operate, a fixed pitch helicopter is a practical solution. 

With collective pitch RC helicopters, the speed of the rotor stays constant. The lift varies according to the pitch of the primary blades throughout the complete rotation. Collective pitch helicopters have several advantages over the fixed pitch machines, such as improved response to controls, autorotation abilities and inverted flying capabilities. This type of helicopter is built from a more complicated design and they are much more fragile than their fixed pitch counterparts are, so the price is considerably higher. 

Smaller electric collective pitch RC helicopters can be flown indoors due to their light weight, which starts around one pound. However, electric collective pitch helicopters are really meant for flying outdoors. The low mass of these helicopters decrease the amount of damage that occurs in a crash. In addition, these types of helicopters can be run backwards and then forward again rather quickly. 

The greatest disadvantage to smaller electric collective pitch radio-controlled helicopters is the fact that they are greatly affected by the wind. You can only fly these helicopters in winds of around ten to fifteen miles per hour. In addition, the controls on these machines are more sensitive that the controls on larger helicopters, which makes them more difficult to fly. 

The larger electric helicopters are not practical for flying in public places. Large electric helicopters, just like nitro helicopters, can be quite dangerous. 

Nitro powered collective pitches typically weigh somewhere between six or seven pounds. Because of their larger size and the amount of noise that they make, you should only fly these helicopters at designated flying sites. The additional weight makes these helicopters easier to fly, but the cost to repair the machine after a crash is not cheap. You should only attempt to operate these machines if you are an experienced RC helicopter pilot, especially due to the energy that is stored in the spinning rotor as well as the extra weight. 

Tandem rotor RC helicopters are quite rare. With this type of radio-controlled helicopter, there are two rotors mounted longitudinally that counter rotate, cancelling out the majority of the rotor torque. Since tandem rotor helicopters are so complex, most helicopters of this type are collective pitch; even though building one that is fixed pitch would not be an impossible feat. 

Collective pitch coaxial helicopters are especially rare. A collective pitch coaxial helicopter is distinct because of its ability to fly in zero gravity. 
RC Helicopter Gear The items that are covered in this section are considered necessary for piloting an RC helicopter in the field. A number of the items that you are going to learn about are things that you are going to need right away, while others may only be needed later down the road. Without the necessary gear, your flying time may be cut abruptly short.  
Radio Small fixed-pitch helicopters need a 4-channel radio (throttle, elevator, aileron, rudder), although micro helicopters that utilize a 2-channel infrared control system also exist; while collective-pitch models need a minimum of 5 channels with 6 being most common (throttle, collective pitch, elevator, aileron, rudder and gyro gain).  
A Good Book Especially if you are just getting started with radio-controlled helicopters, you need to invest in a good helicopter book. One of the best books on the subject is “Safe and Easy Helicopter Flying” by Bob Motazedi. You may also want to check out “RC Model Helicopters: A Guide for Beginners” by Malcolm Messiter, “Building Scale Helicopters” by Peter Wales and “3D Helicopter Flying” by Russ Deakin.  
Simulator If you are serious about flying radio-controlled helicopters, it is a good idea to invest in a good helicopter simulator. A number of good simulators are currently on the market. The investment that you make on a helicopter simulator is well worth it, especially considering the money that it will save you on the flying field. Aircraft libraries and realism vary from one simulator to the next, so take some time to find the one that is right for you.  
Training Gear Training gear for radio-controlled helicopters is nothing more that some simple fiberglass or wooden sticks arranged in a tic tack toe or cross pattern. On the end of each of these sticks is a light plastic ball. The plastic balls keep the sticks from ramming into the ground as the helicopter is bobbing along. You should be able to find training gear for your RC helicopter for around twenty to forty dollars. If you prefer, you can save money by building your own RC helicopter training gear. 
RC Helicopter Construction Choosing a RC helicopter that is constructed of the correct material does not have to be a stressful task. Take the time to explore some of the most common materials to determine the one that is best for your radio-controlled helicopter. 

RC helicopters must be built to endure all types of stress, including low and high frequency vibrations, hard landings, heat, centrifugal forces as well as G-forces and more. So, it is important that the material you choose for your RC helicopter is strong enough to survive, yet still light enough to fly through the air with ease. 
Understanding RC Helicopter Controls Radio-controlled helicopter controls can be somewhat difficult to understand. However, if you take the time to understand the controls one step at a time, it will make much more sense for you. 

Single rotor radio-controlled helicopters are not easy to fly at first. These machines follow the same rules and have the same controls as a full size helicopter. First, you must understand the laws and forces, and then it will be easy for you to understand RC helicopter controls. 

RC helicopter controls can be broken down into three basic areas, including direction and cyclic control, lift and collective control as well as torque and tail rotor control. When you fully understand all three of these basic areas of radio-controlled helicopter flight and have a good idea of just how helicopters fly, you will be able to understand RC helicopter controls fully. 
Conclusion Flying a radio-controlled helicopter is quite a rewarding experience. However, with such great reward comes the requirement of patience and dedication. If you are interested in buying a RC helicopter, fixing it up and zipping around the sky like an expert, do not expect such a feat to happen overnight. 

An important factor to consider is RC helicopter safety. The blades on RC helicopters rotate as fast as 1,500 RPM, and can have a blade radius of around three feet. The speed of the blade on a RC helicopter is roughly two hundred miles per hour, which will cut though grass as well as skin and bones. 

The cost of flying RC helicopters is a great factor that must be considered when you are determining if this is the right hobby for you. Piloting radio-controlled helicopters is by no means a cheap hobby. Crashes are bound to occur eventually. When crashes do happen, you can expect to pay several dollars, even hundreds of dollars, to pay for repairs and spare parts. You need to set money aside consciously in order to support your RC helicopter hobby.",
Acrobatics,"Acrobatics Information Introduction By the time most of us are heading off to school, we have been exposed to the incredible world of acrobatics at least one, whether we realize it or not. Acrobatics surrounds many aspects of modern life, from gymnastics to skateboarding, from extreme skiing to high-flying circus acts. Acrobatics is something that inspires awe and wonder, a lot like magic tricks can do. 

Many adults, as they grow older, look to the people who perform these incredible maneuvers in the air, from flips to somersaults, from ski jumps to the gravity-defying half-pipe work of professional skateboarders, and they wonder if they could ever consider doing something like. These same spectators then wonder how a person could make his or her body twist so much, how they could spin so fast in the air, and still land where they want to be and not be hurt. 

The human body is arguably the most incredible piece of machinery in the history of the world and its ability to accomplish just about any feat imaginable has made the art and science of acrobatics a world phenomenon. 

Acrobatics isn’t an American pastime. It doesn’t belong to the Chinese. The Russians haven’t perfected it above all others. Every nation in the world has citizens who perform acrobatic stunts on a regular basis. It is the quintessential common ground that many of these nations, sometimes friend, sometimes foe, can share. 

The Russians are renowned for their acrobatic circus routines while the Chinese have long dominated the gymnastics front in world competitions, and the Americans are the leaders in extreme games, such as skateboarding and bike stunts. All of these activities are rooted in the foundation of acrobatics. 

Learning to be an acrobat, whether you are a young child who dreams of one day competing in the Olympics as a gymnast or skateboarder, or you are an adult who wants to step into the world and wonder of acrobatics, then the possibility rests right there in front of you. 

Flipping in the air and landing on your feet is an acrobatic stunt, but it isn’t the place to begin for a novice. Learning to balance while in motion is the most important first step. Once that is mastered (and there is more to that step than simply walking and staying upright), then the next aspects can come into play. 

There is no age limit on learning acrobatics, but the tougher the activity, the stronger one will need to be. It is also a good idea to have healthy and strong bones structure because landing some acrobatic stunts will place an enormous amount of pressure on bones and joints. It is unwise for an eighty-year-old man to attempt to skateboard on the half-pipe, but there’s no reason why he couldn’t learn to do a cartwheel, or a jackknife dive into a pool. 

Acrobatics takes physical effort and training. Both of those are attainable for just about everyone in the world.  
Activities The different and main activities in acrobatics are: Acro dance / Acrobalance / Acrobatic gymnastics / Acroyoga / Adagio / Aerial tissu / Bossaball / Capoeira / Contortion / Corde lisse / Diving / Globe of death / Gymnastics / Handstand / Hooping / Hopak / Juggling / Parkour / Pole climbing / Salto del pastor / Skateboarding / Skiing / Snowboarding / Spanish web / Surfing / Synchronized swimming / Tightrope walking / Trampolining / Trapeze / Tricking / Tumbling / Wushu / Waterskiing 
Hazards and Dangers When a person mentions the word acrobatics, one thing that generally doesn’t come to mind is danger, but acrobatics can lead to many different types of injuries, from broken ankles and wrists to spinal cord injuries and even death. Acrobatics is not something that people should attempt without the proper guidance or safety equipment. 

The young kid who is learning how to skateboard may not want to wear the protective gear, but it will ensure that every time he falls (and he will fall quite often), it won’t result in some injury. Brain injuries are some common injuries when performing acrobatic stunts when not properly supervised or wearing a helmet. 

Take a walk around town, regardless of where you live, and you will likely see kids riding their skateboards or bikes without a helmet and without pads, trying to try different stunts and maneuvers in the air. This is a recipe for danger and while kids believe that they are invincible and that nothing bad will happen to them, parents should know the truth. 

To learn how to perform acrobatic stunts, it is highly recommended that you seek out a trained and qualified professional who can offer the right guidance, tips, and information that you can use to best protect yourself from injury or your child. 

From skiing to skateboarding to gymnastics, there are countless stories of injuries that didn’t have to happen, some of them catastrophic. An exuberant teenager who decides to work on a parallel bar routine in gymnastics decides to do one last quick routine without a spotter. He gets to the dismount after a flawless exercise only to spin too fast, landing on his toes with the momentum throwing him forward. He flies forward and tries to break his fall with his arms, instinctual. His arms shatter, ending his acrobatic life in an instant. 

If he had waited for a spotter, this kind of injury would have been avoidable. 

So the first rule of thumb to keep in mind when learning acrobatics, whether it is for yourself or your child or another loved one, is to make sure that they realize the importance of waiting for a professional to guide you through the process, no matter how skilled you or the person you know has become. 

There are no second chances when it comes to injury and acrobatics will put the body at risk in more ways than one, so it’s important to at least understand and accept the inherent risks involved. 
Where to Start Acrobatics If you or someone you know is interested in learning acrobatics, the place to start can be at any number of locations. The thing that needs to be answered before this can be determined is what kind of acrobatics does the individual wish to do. If a person wishes to learn how to perform stunt tricks on a skateboard, then the person to seek out would be a qualified skateboarding professional. 

There is no point in practicing somersaults in a gym in the hope of performing flips on the half pipe before the person, child or otherwise, knows whether he or she will even be any good at the sport or have the interest to follow through with it to that point. Each activity, from skiing to surfing and everything in between will demand that the person master the basic skills involved before they would even begin to learn anything acrobatic involved in it. 

A novice skier who is still struggling to make it down the easy trail without falling down a half a dozen times isn’t a likely candidate for taking off on a jump, or skiing the double diamond mogul trails through the woods. The individual who is still attempting to keep his or her balance on a surfboard when the wave is pushing them forward isn’t quite ready to attempt any spins of flips over the crashing waves. 

Determine the activity that the person is truly interested in and seek out the right instructor to get him or her moving toward the stage where they are ready to learn some acrobatic stunts. 

While this advice should hold for most of the activities listed earlier, one can still take a gymnastics course to start learning the most basic routines, from the balance beam to cartwheels and handstands. These are the basis for all other acrobatic abilities and before one can learn to do a flip, he or she must first learn to perform these other routines. 

In most towns and cities across the world, there are numerous gymnastics centers. Unfortunately for many school districts, the idea of teaching children the basics has been discarded due to liability and potential injuries that can occur. This should deter you or your child from trying gymnastics, at least for a while. 

What you want to look for in a gymnastics instructor is a person who has trained for many years, preferable someone who has won awards, and ideally an instructor whose students have gone on to win awards. These kinds of instructors will be more difficult to find in many communities, and will often charge more than other locations, but they are worth every penny. 

Yes, nine times out of ten, a student will go to his or her lessons and come away without incident, but it’s that one time where something could go wrong that makes having the right instructor all that much more important. 
Combining Activities When learning a new sport or activity that will ultimately require some acrobatic skills, combining the learning of the basics of these acrobatic skills with the instruction of that primary sport or activity will lead to a quicker learning curve and eventually more skills in the long run. 

When someone has an interest in skateboard acrobatics, having him or her take gymnastics while learning to skateboard will get them ready to handle the pressure and the fear of performing stunts on the board itself. Far too many mishaps occur simply because an individual lacked the confidence needed to carry through the challenge completely. 

Another benefit of working with gymnastics while learning another activity is that should interest in the latter wane –for example, the youth decides after a year of skateboarding that he would rather try BMX biking or even skiing- he or she is still learning the skills to be adept at these other activities as well. 

Combining acrobatic activities is a great way to help a person learn the basic fundamentals that can be applied to just about any other physical activity that they partake in. 

Even team and individual sports, such as soccer, football, and even tennis. Being able to maintain balance while on the run, in traffic, or chasing down a ball can give a person a significant advantage over other players who aren’t skilled in these acrobatic arts. Balance and being able to overcome situations that arise is a great gift to have. 
Frequently Asked Questions My child has expressed an interest in competitive ski jumping, would it be a good idea to enroll him in gymnastics? Absolutely. The basis for ski jumping or any extreme skiing is rooted in acrobatics, so that if your child wishes to excel in this activity, learning the fundamentals of gymnastics will be an important step toward mastering the art of ski jumping as well as other routines that can present themselves while growing and learning the activity. 

I always thought acrobatics was just about stunts, like circus acts. Is it really a part of skateboarding half-pipe performances? Watching some of the best skateboarders in the world can certainly make it easy to forget just the amount of skill that is required to carry out those stunts and maneuvers and still make them look so easy. Maneuvering through a half-pipe and doing flips and other acrobatic stunts requires balance, timing, and incredible skill. Just because a person isn’t in the center of a three ring circus, high up on a trapeze, it doesn’t mean that what they’re doing isn’t acrobatic in nature. 

Do all of those professionals like skateboarders and surfers take gymnastics to learn those stunts? No, of course not. Many of the world’s best performers practiced the hard way, through trial and error and a ton of bandages and ice. But it’s important to consider what they might be capable of had they had some other training in gymnastics, for instance. Some of the best performers actually take on skilled gymnastic instructors when they reach a certain point in their skill level. These instructors help them learn the basics of flips and landing properly. So, in a sense, they do rely on professional gymnastics instructors; just not always in a gym setting. 
Conclusion Acrobatics surrounds so much of our daily lives and entertainment. From the athletes that compete in the most arduous and difficult sports in the world to world-class entertainers who carry out incredible routines on stage for our benefit, acrobatics is simply a part of life and has been for hundreds of years. 

From the court jester who performed for the king to the modern extreme athlete who is trying to learn how to go higher, farther, and faster, all while doing it upside down or spinning end over end, the science and art of acrobatics has become an ingrained aspect in life. 

For those that want to learn, it is really never too late. It just takes some practice, time, and the right instruction and you could be on your way to learning how to flip in the air and land on your feet.",
Snow Skiing,"Snow Skiing InformationIntroSnow skiing is not just a hobby but can also be a classy way to keep fit. Remember James Bond, skiing in cold pursuit of the bad guys! You can be in tune with Mother Nature, enjoy fresh air, and be one among the mountains. With a little training, you too can take up snow skiing not just as a hobby but also as a way of life.
It helps if you are staying in an area where it snows. This will make it easy for you to travel to and fro from the mountains where you plan to ski. There are various types of skiing techniques that you could learn. There is Alpine or downhill skiing, Cross-country or Nordic skiing, speed skiing, extreme skiing etc. Depending on which style of skiing you want to learn, you can buy the matching equipment. You will therefore require the correct type of skis. So for example for cross-country skiing you will require skis where the heel can lift up to enable you to ‘walk’ on the snow, whereas in alpine skiing you will require to be fully attached to your skis, so that you can stay in control during your downhill run. Cross-country skis are also longer and thinner. The construction of your skis is also very important. Older skis were made of wood but now in addition, skis are also made of aluminum, fiberglass and nowadays, of carbon fiber, titanium and Kevlar. You can join classes or a ski school which have skiing instructors to teach you all about skiing. They can provide you with the right equipment to teach you about skiing. You can learn privately, where a ski instructor will provide training only to you or you could sign up in a group. Private lessons are naturally more expensive, but then you get the undivided attention of your instructor. So choose according to your budget. Basic training is necessary for whichever style of skiing you want to pursue further on. The skiing slope should have a variety of small obstacles like bumps and twists so that you can learn to jump over them or dodge around them. You should be warmly dressed with a ski jacket, snow goggles and proper gloves. As with any other sport, keep a first aid kit with splints and painkillers close at hand always.
LearningIn the beginners' course you will be taught to stand up, maintain your balance and ski slowly down a gentle slope. You will then be taught to increase speed as well as turn left and right by shifting your body weight. You will also be taught to use your ski poles correctly. Ski poles help you to maintain your balance as well as propel you ahead. Always warm up by doing simple stretching exercises or take a small walk. Advanced ski poles are light and flexible but sturdy. Once you learn to ski, then you can start downhill skiing. Your speed will be determined depending on the gradient of the slope and the snow conditions. Downhill skiing is fast and exhilarating and you feel the wind in your face as you turn your body from side to side. On a big mountain slope, you can try various different ways of skiing down. That will provide hours and hours of unlimited fun, and also improve your skiing skills.There are various styles in skiing downhill such as powder, freestyle, speed and mogul. Powder skiing is when you ski on light powder-like snow. Ski lovers love this kind of skiing since it allows them to display their technical skills and the feeling of gliding over powdery snow is pure bliss. A mogul is basically a slope with lots of small bumps, where you use your knees as a spring to move over the bumps. This style improves not only body flexibility but also jumping skills and timing. This style is also very exciting because each bump has its own unique character.
However, the best way for you to get totally immersed in nature is to try out cross-country or Nordic skiing, also known as backcountry or off-piste skiing. You can attempt cross-country skiing once you get enough skiing experience since cross-country skiing involves skiing in unchartered territory. Do not attempt it alone; take along a partner who has prior experience. Also carry a proper first aid kit along with you. If your mobile phone works in those areas then carry it along or if budget is not an issue you can carry a satellite phone or GPS system along with you. Cross-country skiing puts you literally in the lap of nature and the feeling of skiing long distances without anybody bumping into you can totally relax your mind and body. You can visit different ski resorts, which have cross-country packages. That way, you can get a change of scenery and skiing conditions every time you go cross-country skiing. Wear bright-colored outer clothing and be careful of avalanche-prone areas during your cross-country adventure. Once you have mastered these forms of skiing, and still want more adventure, you can enter into the dangerous arena of extreme skiing. This involves skiing down from almost 90-degree mountain faces and moving at maniacal speeds. It also involves high and long jumps and you should attempt this only if you have become an expert in various methods of skiing and are medically declared ‘physically competent’ and tough enough to handle it. Broken bones and concussions are unwanted side effects of this extreme sport.Many resorts provide weather forecasts and these can be useful if you want book a package or even before you leave on one. Your ideal vehicle would be a 4 wheel drive SUV with lots of interior space and a ski rack on top. This rack can hold your skis, if you are planning to use your own. Since the weather will be cold, your vehicle’s heating system should also be checked before leaving. A first aid kit with medicines, warm and waterproof clothes and flasks filled with hot chocolate and coffee should be taken along if there are no proper eating outlets along the way. Your clothes should include thermal underwear, thermal shirts and pants, padded thick ski socks. Over these clothes you can wear a woolen or fleece jacket or sweater, ski pants and your ski boots. Do not forget to wear a ski helmet. If you wish to learn more about Winter Sports Safety, you can check out this guide.
ConclusionNowadays, there are many variants to snow skiing such as snowboarding, which can be tried out. Even physically handicapped people can learn to ski, with technology now providing for special skiing equipment. So, do not just look at the snow from your window. Go out, take a deep breath and enjoy the wonders of nature. Skiing is a wonderful sport and it is also a hobby to keep you fit for life.",
Yoga,"Yoga Information  Yoga Evolution In the Western world, yoga was once considered the province of New Agers and students of Eastern philosophy. However, the 2005 ""Yoga in America"" survey, conducted by Yoga Journal, shows that the number of practitioners in the US increased to 16.5 million with the 18-24 age group, showing a 46% increase in one year. Many celebrities and fitness experts have brought yoga into the spotlight by incorporating it into their regular fitness routines. 

Now yoga has been added to mainstream workouts for stress relief, increased flexibility, and strength training. Highly successful commercial fitness programs often include “power” yoga for fat-burning and weight loss. Televised yoga sequences are available to run beginners through basic sets of poses. Many primary and secondary schools use yoga poses in their physical education curricula. 

Libraries and bookstores are filled with yoga books for practitioners of all skill levels, including young children. Almost every fitness center offers some type of yoga class. There is Ashtanga yoga for meditation and visualization; Hatha yoga for physical strength and well-being; and Raja yoga for stress-relief and clarity of thought. 

Some of the latest yoga trends include “hot” yoga, which is performed in a sauna or other humid atmosphere, and nude yoga, which is performed without clothing of any kind. Fans of hot yoga believe that the increased output of sweat helps to cleanse the body from the inside out. Nude yoga practitioners are quick to defend their unusual discipline, insisting that it is a legitimate way to forge a connection between the body and spirit, and does not involve voyeurism or sex of any sort. 
Health Benefits of Yoga Different asanas are recommended by practitioners to cure or prevent problems ranging from constipation to cancer. Yoga is known to reduce stress and other mental worries. It can be most helpful for people who find it difficult to focus their thoughts, or those who are plagued with depression or anxiety. Different poses focus on different areas of the body, so it is easy to design a personalized yoga sequence to address your medical concerns. 

Yoga teaches us the valuable lessons of stepping away from everyday stresses and taking a moment to look inward. It encourages us to be mindful of our bodies and what we put into them. Rather than engaging in mindless eating or using chemicals to numb emotional pain, yoga practitioners learn to pay attention to the true needs of their bodies and souls. 

Chronic stress can lead to obesity, heart disease, and depression. It can worsen the symptoms of certain diseases, such as diabetes, lupus, and multiple sclerosis. Yoga, being a very calming art, has a beneficial effect on stress levels. The breathing and meditative techniques are especially prized for their ability to induce a relaxed state of being. This relaxation translates into tangible medical benefits such as lower pulse and blood pressure, improved circulation, a fortified immune system, and increased pain tolerance. 

Because many of the yoga postures require you to flex your limbs or torso in new ways, or to hold the position for a number of breaths, they cultivate joint flexibility, good posture, and improved muscle strength. Strong joints and muscles can ward off conditions such as arthritis and even osteoporosis. Persons suffering from chronic pain often experience a marked improvement after practicing yoga. 

Yoga has many “invisible” health benefits as well. Studies have credited yoga with lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels, thus lowering the risk of heart disease. Patients with gastrointestinal problems are frequently advised to begin practicing yoga for its soothing effects. Some patients find that yoga helps regulate their blood glucose levels as well. 

Yoga has earned a reputation as an effective weight loss aid. Because it stimulates the metabolism, yoga helps practitioners burn fat at a faster rate. Its mindful approach to the body helps you differentiate between true hunger and stress-induced cravings. Some speculate that yoga stretches the muscles in a way that prevents the accumulation of cellulite. Yoga also promotes heightened energy levels. This is especially helpful for those who are normally too tired to exercise. 

Because yoga carries a very low risk of injury, it is appropriate for people of all ages and fitness levels. Children can use yoga to improve their balance, core strength, mental focus, and awareness of their bodies. Elderly individuals can use yoga to improve and maintain muscle tone, keep their joints supple, and improve their balance to prevent fall-related injuries. 

Athletes commonly add yoga to their workouts to develop greater strength and flexibility. Swimmers, runners, and other athletes use yoga to help them tone their bodies and visualize success. Wrestlers, boxers, and martial artists strengthen their cores and develop a deeper awareness of their bodies through yoga exercises. Dancers use yoga to become much more flexible, and to learn flowing, graceful movements. 

Couples yoga has gained popularity for the intimacy it brings to relationships. Couples who practice yoga together report increased energy, better awareness of their bodies, and an overall improvement in the quality of their lovemaking. Yoga is also beneficial for pregnant women, who often experience back and hip pain due to the extra weight in their abdomen. Poses that flex the spine can prevent this sort of pain from happening, or decrease existing pain dramatically. 
A Typical Yoga Session A yoga session begins well before you start the actual exercise. Some yoga practitioners start their preparations early. They avoid eating heavy foods, preferring to practice on an empty or mostly empty stomach. Some use neti pots to clear their sinuses so that they can perform their breathing exercises unhindered. 

Yoga sessions typically begin with a warm-up phase. This is a series of stretches and gentle poses which prepare the joints for more rigorous postures. A proper warm-up will stretch the spine, shoulders, limbs, and core. This is an important step which should never be disregarded, because pulls and sprains can result from practicing yoga with stiff joints and muscles. 

Next come the standing poses. These poses are designed to continue warming up the body while building muscle strength and improving your balance. Many involve stretching the arms above the head, or bending at the waist. These are some of the best poses for weight loss. 

After the standing poses come the sitting poses. The seated poses help you focus on your breathing. They also stretch the legs and hips, and many of the poses stretch the spine as well. Seated poses are highly adaptable for all skill levels. You can start out with basic poses, then move on to intermediate or advanced as your strength and balance improve. 

Next come the twist poses. They build on the spine stretches that began in seated posture, flexing the spine even more and relieving muscle tension that causes backaches. By twisting the body to each side in a variety of ways, you increase your blood flow and circulation, both of which are important for vertebral health and overall rejuvenation. 

Supine poses are done while lying on your back. They primarily strengthen the core muscles, including the back and abdominals. A strong core improves your balance and helps you move more easily and efficiently. These poses are wonderful for relieving tension in the stomach area as well. 

Inverted poses and balance poses help the experienced practitioner build their strength and balance. These poses build on the skills learned in simpler postures. Good coordination is required for most of these poses. Because they require intense concentration, inverted and balance poses also give the practitioner a mental workout that sharpens the mind by teaching them to drown out distractions. 

Backbend poses are advanced spine stretches that relieve tension throughout the front of the body, hips, and pelvic region. They are also believed to have a beneficial effect on the adrenal glands and the kidneys. 

The session winds down with relaxing finishing poses. These poses cool down the body and slow the heart rate. Some practitioners follow this up with meditation. An entire yoga session takes about 30 minutes, but health benefits can come from as few as 15 minutes of yoga daily. 
Getting Started with Yoga Yoga is an excellent exercise for beginners. There is no need to purchase special equipment, and yoga routines can be done at home or in any comfortable, relaxed environment. There is a wide variety of postures, many of which are easy for beginners. There are also enough challenging poses to keep the practitioner from becoming bored over time. 

While no special gear is required, you will need to have loose, comfortable clothing that allow you to move freely. Yoga is often practiced barefoot, but you can use soft shoes or non-slip socks as well. A yoga mat can be helpful, but a thick towel or blanket can work, too. If you have limited range of motion due to age or injury, you might want to invest in some foam yoga blocks. These blocks help you assume poses that might otherwise be too difficult at first. 

Next, you will need to decide where you will practice yoga. Most gyms and health clubs offer yoga classes in a group setting. These are useful for familiarizing yourself with the basic principles of yoga, and offer you the opportunity to ask questions if you are uncertain about a technique. Such classes can become expensive; if you want to try a group yoga class for a more affordable price, consider community, senior, or recreational centers. Many college campuses offer quality yoga programs at a reduce cost. 

If you prefer to practice alone, you have many options. You can check out instructional yoga books and DVDs from your local library. That will give you the chance to try yoga and decide if you want to make it a part of your life, without any cost whatsoever. You can purchase yoga tutorials and DVDs at book stores or online. There are literally thousands of titles to choose from, so look for ones that have received numerous positive buyer reviews. 

A Web search for “yoga tutorial” will turn up hundreds of sites featuring pictures and video clips that teach you basic poses. Many of these sites have communities of yoga fans who can answer your questions and give you advice. 

Next, consider the location where you will practice. If you plan to take a group class at a gym or recreation center, this problem is already solved for you. If you opted to do yoga at home, you will need to find a quiet spot free of noise and visual distractions. This could be your bedroom, living room, or even outdoors in your back yard. If noise is a problem, invest in some comfortable foam ear plugs, or an MP3 player and headphones. Soothing music could make your home yoga sessions even more fulfilling. 

Finally, you can decide whether to follow a pre-recorded yoga session or design your own. Again, this is not an issue if you are taking a group class with an instructor. They will help you follow the routine they designed. But if you’re practicing at home, you can use a book or DVD, or create your own routine. 

Instructional materials are very useful for beginners. Become acquainted with the theory and practice of yoga before you create your own routine. This will ensure a balanced regimen and proper form, both of which are important for overall health. 

Like many yoga practitioners, you might want to modify your eating habits by avoiding heavy food for 2 to 3 hours before your yoga session. If you grow hungry, eat something light and easily digestible, like fruit. If necessary, use a gentle salt water rinse to clear your throat and nostrils. This will make it easier to perform the deep, relaxing breathing techniques. 

Begin your sequence with attunement exercises. Practice your breathing while lying in a supine position. Then flow through Child Pose and Cat Pose to give your back a gentle stretch. After a few minutes, rise to your feet and begin your warm-up poses. Stretch your limbs and perform forward bends to warm up and loosen your back and spine. 

You can create a sequence of standing poses for yourself, or go through the traditional sun salutation sequence. The sun salutations are a series of 12 postures that stretch and strengthen. The poses are performed as one graceful sequence, with one pose flowing into the next as you breathe deeply and regularly. Most beginner yoga guides contain instructions for the sun salutations, and you can also find illustrated guides online. 

After you’ve finished the standing poses, move on to a balance pose. Choose one or two to focus on during your routine. As your balance improves, you can run through several of these poses in one sequence. Choose poses that require you to stand on one foot, such as Tree Pose, or those which allow you to remain near the ground, such as Balancing Cat. You will be holding these poses for quite some time, so choose the ones most comfortable to you. 

Next, add an inverted pose like Dead Bug. While it has a funny name, this posture is useful for stretching the groin and toning the abdominal muscles. Boat Pose is another good posture for developing balance, core strength, and toned abs. After you’ve gained some experience, you can add advanced twists and backbends to your routine. 

Finish up with gentle stretches and cool-down postures. Choose supine poses that help you focus on your breathing, such as Knee-to-Chest Pose. Do these for at least 3 minutes at the end of your sequence. 

After you have designed your sequence, run through it a few times to make sure it suits your needs. Remember, yoga is a flowing art. Each pose should flow easily into the next, with transitional poses in between if needed. The entire sequence should be between 15 and 30 minutes long. As you become more skilled, you can extend your routine to 45 or 60 minutes. 

Always check with your doctor before beginning a yoga routine. You will probably get the go-ahead, since yoga has so many health benefits. But your doctor might advise you to avoid putting stress on certain parts of your body. There are plenty of poses to choose from, so even if you are advised to avoid some of them, you will still be able to do more than enough poses to get serious benefits.",
Ceramics-Pottery,"Ceramics-Pottery InformationDEFINITIONCeramic art covers the art of pottery which is made by forming a clay body into objects of a special shape and then heating them to a certain temperature in a kiln to create a reaction that leads to their strength and hardening.HISTORY AND TRADITIONAL STYLESWhen most people think of pottery, they think of bowls and plates, or perhaps cups, vases, and ashtrays. And it is true that the functional forms of pottery may be the most common. But archeologically, the study of pottery may also allow inferences to be drawn about a culture`s daily life, religion, social relationships, attitudes toward neighbors, attitudes to their own world and even the way the culture understood the universe. The earliest history of pottery production can be divided into four periods namely; the Hassuna period (5000 - 4,500 BCE), the Halaf period (4,500 - 4000 BCE), the Ubaid period (4000 - 3000 BCE), and the Uruk period (3,500 - 2000 BCE). Ceramics, itself, dates back even farther, to the year 25,000 BCE, with the discovery of a Venus figurine in the modern-day Czech Republic. But it was the invention of the potter’s wheel in Mesopotamia sometime between 6,000 and 4,000 BCE (Ubaid period) revolutionized pottery production.POTTERY PROCESSShaping is done in various ways, but working clay with the hands is always used at one point, or another. The clay material is either built up from a flat slab, a stack of coils, or balls of clay to form the desired shape. A slurry solution is added to smooth out unwanted bumps and to help work out spaces of air. Working by hand is the slowest method, but it is also the most controlled means of producing size and shape. Studio potters most often choose hand shaping because it allows them to create unique pieces.“Throwing” refers to the process potters use when a potter’s wheel is used. It involves placing a ball of clay on a turntable that the potter rotates with a stick, a foot-powered treadle, or an electric motor. The throwing wheel rotates rapidly and as it moves, the potter presses out a center in the ball (“centering”), gently hollowing out a center in the clay (“opening”), making a flat or rounded bottom inside the pot (“flooring”), drawing up the sides so that they’re even and symmetrical (“pulling”), and then removing excess clay to make an even foot (“trimming”). Until the introduction of slip casting in the 18th century, the potter’s wheel was the most effective method of mass producing pottery. Because if its inherent limitations, wheel work can only be used to create wares with radial symmetry on a vertical axis. These can then be altered by impressing, bulging, carving, fluting, faceting, incising, and other methods, making the wares more visually interesting. Often, thrown pieces are further modified by having handles, lids, feet, spouts, and other functional aspects added using the techniques of hand working. Shapes and textures can be added through the use of paddles, rollers, knives, wires, burnishing stones, and rasps.ORNAMENTATIONPottery can be decorated in an almost limitless number of ways. The clay can be incised (cut with a wedged object to make a three dimensional pattern), it can be decorated with an underglaze, it can use in-glaze or on-glaze decoration, and it can be enameled. You can use additives to your piece, such as sand, differently colored clays, and colorants, such as metal oxides or carbonates. Combustible particles, such as salt or sulfur, can be pressed into the clay’s surface to produce striking textures, once the pottery has been fired. Agateware results from banding different clays together in order to produce the mottled or veined appearance of agate. Banding, or lining, adds a color to the edge of a plate or cup and is usually done while the piece is still on the potter’s wheel. Burnishing refers to an application where the surface of a piece is rubbed with wood, steel or stone before it is fired. When fine clays are used with the burnishing process, a highly polished surface will result. An engobe is a whitish slip of clay that can be added before firing; it can be painted on or dipped to provide a uniform, even coat. If it is used in several coats, it resembles a glaze. A litho (or transfer print) can be used on the pottery. This involves three layers—the actual image layer, the cover coat, and the clear, protective layer. Gold can be added to high quality objects by various means, such as painting, etching, a “bright gold” solution, or a rubbing of gold leaf with sugar and salt.A glaze is the “glassy” part of ornamentation on a piece of pottery. It is also the process that waterproofs it. It can be accomplished by dusting, spraying, dipping, or brushing with a mineral/water mixture. The color of a glazed piece before and after firing may differ. An additional piece of advice is to either not glaze the foot portion of the piece or use little supports (spurs) inside the kiln so that the piece doesn’t stick to the rack during the firing process.CERAMICSA ceramic is an inorganic, non-metallic solid prepared by the action of heat and subsequent cooling. Ceramic materials may have a crystalline or partly crystalline structure, or may be amorphous (e.g., a glass). Because most common ceramics are crystalline, the definition of ceramic is often restricted to inorganic crystalline materials, as opposed to the non-crystalline glasses. “Ceramic” may be used as an adjective describing a material, product or process; or as a singular noun, or, more commonly, as a plural noun, ceramics. In contemporary, domestic terms, ceramics takes on a specific form of hobby, mainly the painting and ornamentation of greenware, usually pre-formed into all sorts of vases, plates, bowls, figurines, etc. For nominal fees, art studios or recreational centers allow the public to come in and paint a piece or two and then return a week later, after firing, to glaze and add any other effects.The earliest ceramics were pottery objects made from clay, either by itself or mixed with other materials, hardened in fire. Later ceramics were glazed and fired to create a colored, smooth surface. Ceramics now include domestic, industrial and building products and art objects. In the 20th century, new ceramic materials were developed for use in advanced ceramic engineering; for example, in semiconductors.Some of the better-loved, contemporary collectible types of ceramics include Delftware, Royal Doulton, bone china, and Wedgwood.PLACES TO DISPLAY OR SELLNow (returning to the 21st century), once you find a style you’re happy with and successful at reproducing, you can begin to look for galleries, bookstores, or nooks at art co-ops where you can stash a few of your pieces. See what the public finds pleasing enough to buy and take home. If you are lucky enough, you might be commissioned to customize some pieces for a local business or festival. If you can’t find a suitable gallery to expose your work to the public, consider creating an attractive website with good quality images. Be sure to photograph the unique colors or angles that you worked so hard to create. Then make sure to generate interest (and “hits”) to the website to get your page among the first displayed when someone Googles on the word “pottery” or “pottery gallery.” Many artists do this with their portfolios, and with good results. Visit their websites and take note of their prices so that you can list comparable prices. Your goal should be to become recognized for your original style. Whether or not you’ve had any luck on the internet, try other approaches. If your friend has a show room or warehouse, ask for a chance to hold a special showing where your “wares” might be featured. Most friends in such businesses will see this as a good opportunity to expose new people to their items or products, too. This is another good chance to distribute your business cards (with your online gallery’s address included, of course).It suffices to say that even knowing all about the processes of basic pottery or ceramics doesn’t actually mean anything until you’re physically working on a piece from the bottom up (if you’re molding using a potter’s wheel) or the top down (if you’re glazing or painting ceramics). The good thing about using coils of clay or a simple ball is that you can always pound the shape back into nothing if you don’t like what you’re seeing. A single piece of clay can undergo dozens of iterations before you find something aesthetic; it’s a very necessary part of the art. You may find out the hard way that certain glazes won’t work over certain types of paint, or that your piece was too narrow in a certain area to withstand a particular heat setting or method used in the kiln. Keep experimenting—it is the heart and soul of every great artist.",
Hot Wheel and Matchbox Cars,"Hot Wheel and Matchbox Cars InformationINTRODUCTIONThere are many avid Hot Wheels and Matchbox enthusiasts around the world who love to talk about, collect, and learn about these wonderful toy cars that bring back many fond memories for so many of them from their youth. Almost every young boy who grew up in the sixties, seventies, and eighties (and still to this day) have had, at one time or another in their life, owned a Matchbox or Hot Wheels car. It has become almost a rite of passage, a tradition passed down from father to son and the popularity of these toys hasn’t diminished much through the years.While the average individual might not fully understand which car came first, the Hot Wheels or the Matchbox series, since they are very similar in their shape and size, it was the Matchbox car that was first introduced to the world by the Lensney Company in England back in 1953.Collecting Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars presents a number of interesting situations for the avid collector and die-hard enthusiast, not the least of which is the fact that while there may be countless cars for sale in garage sales and tag sales around the country and around the world, there are not nearly as many that still have the original packaging that it came with. It is these cars that make a collector strive to continue to seek out and discover the hidden gems that invariably exist in some of the farthest corners of the countryside, lost and forgotten about in some basement for decades, or in an attic that is only now being cleaned out.The condition of many of these Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars will vary as well, with some showing the original color and condition that it had been packaged in, as though someone took extremely good care of their toys, while others will have suffered the usual actions and behaviors of children who played with their Matchbox cars and Hot Wheels every day for months on end.Depending on the level of commitment a collector has to his or her hobby, or the financial interest in collecting, there will be a wide range of possible acquisitions that will appeal to a wide range of collectors. If a person is aiming to collect Matchbox cars only for personal gratification and they aren’t overly concerned with the condition of the toys themselves, then they will have many opportunities to find the models and years that they are interested in.If, on the other hand, a person is interested in the financial gains that can be found through the sale of classic Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars in great condition, then their prospects will be greatly diminished by comparison.As with any hobby, though, it’s important to remember that if you have no passion for it, it won’t last long. However, if you have a serious love and affection for Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars, then you will find that collecting them will be incredibly rewarding and the number of unique and original cars and trucks that you will find will keep you busy for many, many years to come.GETTING STARTEDCollecting Matchbox cars or Hot Wheels can be rewarding for just about anyone, whether they had the joy of playing with them as a kid or whether they have only recently stumbled on the exciting world of collecting. For many people, it’s not about the monetary value of the toys themselves that matter but the connection to their youth.Yet beginning any collecting hobby demands that the individual establish their goals and limits, otherwise a fun and rewarding hobby has the potential to became a dangerous and costly obsession.BudgetWhen you want to get started collecting Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars, the first thing that you will want to do is set a budget. Determine how much you are willing to spend on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis on your new hobby. It’s a good idea to determine all three of these factors because one week you may stumble across a car that you can’t pass up, but one that also exceeds your weekly or monthly budget.By establishing a budget limit, you ensure that you won’t overspend, turning your hobby into a financial nightmare. Once you set a budget, stick to it. Unless you find a first year original Matchbox, in it’s original matchbox-style package, in mint condition at a price you can’t pass, then your budget will help keep you from overspending.Determine what kinds of Matchbox cars or Hot Wheels you want in your collectionIf you are interested in finding the Matchbox or Hot Wheels cars that you played with as a child, then you will have very specific years to look for. If, on the other hand, you are interested in finding as many early editions of the cars from when the company that released the Matchbox cars was Lensney Company in England, long before Hot Wheels were even introduced, then you will likely need to look toward other collectors who are willing to part with them.The older the edition is, the fewer there will be in existence, which means that the price for each one, even in poor to fair condition, will increase.Many people find that starting out a collecting hobby is much easier and more gratifying when they focus on the more readily available items first and then gradually focusing on the harder to find models later on. This is akin to collecting coins. Most avid coin collectors began their collection with the common, everyday coins that they would find as change in their pockets. As time wore on and their collection grew, then they began to look for the less common, harder-to-find coins.The reason that this is preferable to most is that in the beginning of any venture, gratification reinforces the desire. If you set out to only collect hard to find items, then it will be easier to lose interest and give up because there simply aren’t as many of these collectibles available and certainly not in the range of affordability for most people.Keep it simple in the beginning and expand when you have a handle on the process.Where to Find the ToysThere are a number of places that are ideal for locating these Hot Wheels and Matchbox collectible cars. The first and easiest place would be online. Through auction sites or online stores that specialize in these collectibles, you will likely be able to find some of the less classic models for sale at lower prices.Antique stores commonly have Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars for sale.Flea markets are a hotbed of unloading unwanted items for many people, as are garage sales and tag sales. Since many children growing up have a small collection of their own Matchbox cars, when they leave the house and head off to college and to build their own lives, the parents are left to get rid of many of their toys. These Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars are often sold in bulk quantities, meaning you can find a number of cars for very inexpensive prices. Within some of these sales one might even find a small treasure of special model or collector’s edition.Displaying the Hot Wheels and Matchbox CarsWhen you collect Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars, you most likely will want to display them for guests to see, to look at, and recall those moments of their youth when they too used to play with them. There are a few options that you can use to display these toys.The first is a manufactured case designed specifically for Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars. The case will have a narrow compartment for each car situated just behind a sheet of clear plexiglass. This case will likely be able to be mounted on the wall or placed on a shelf. There are also different size cases to accommodate different size collections.The Matchbox cars can also be displayed loosely on shelves, depending on the individual’s design preferences and the type of cars that they own.You can also make your own case out of fine wood, such as oak or maple. This is an elegant way to show off some of your new hobby’s prized work at acquiring these toys.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSAre Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars really worth anything?As with any collectible item, the value of that item will depend on many different factors. The first is the condition of the item. Matchbox cars from the early days of their release, such as when they were released by the Lensney Company as opposed to Mattel, in their original matchbox style packaging, can be worth quite a bit of money since they tend to be rarer. Also, demand will be a factor in determining the value. If there are many people who want a particular Matchbox car, for example, then the price of those items will be driven up.It’s not likely that Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars that were used and played with extensively and manufactured in the late seventies and eighties, however, will be worth much money at all. Still, for enthusiastic collectors, the value of these cars are often measured in factors greater than money.How do I get started collecting Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars?Getting started on collecting of any type of memorabilia is relatively simple. With Matchbox and Hot Wheels, though, there are a number of entry points for people to get into. The first thing is to determine what level of collector you want to be.

It is here on these discussion posts that you can learn a great deal about collecting these toys, the value that some of them hold, where to find the best selection, and even books that others have written to help you in your quest.I used to have a ton of Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars as a kid. Is there any way to find out what ones I might have owned?Avid collectors can help you determine which models were released during those years of your youth. There are also books that you can purchase that will show the different cars, models, and types that were release in different years. Special collector’s editions will also be highlighted here.Where can I find Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars to buy?Online is the fastest growing method of tracking down Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars to purchase, but there are far more available that haven’t made it onto the listing of the World Wide Web just yet. Visit any number of antique shops, tag sales, or garage sales and you’ll likely find these cars. Flea markets are also a boon to collectors around the world. In many cases, however, the condition of the Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars in these places will likely be lower and the original packaging may no longer be part of the collectibles. In these instances, the collector will likely be more interested in acquiring them personal posterity, rather than any financial incentive.CONCLUSIONBeing able to collect items from one’s youth is an incredibly powerful emotional connection to the fond memories that people have, but forget about through the natural course of time. Collecting Hot Wheels or Matchbox cars can be a rewarding hobby for the dedicated enthusiast. Whether you show them off in a collection or put them away for a future generation, these toys are iconic markers of millions of childhoods around the world.Getting started with any collecting hobby requires some time and patience and education about the different types of items, their values, and what to look for.

Ultimately, though, there are many collectibles available for people around the world and one of the most exciting and fun ones happen to be Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars.",
Photography,"Photography Information  Intro Photography is a hobby that just about anyone can take up regardless of age. Practically everyone owns a camera these days. Considering that there are different kinds of cameras available in the market, this is a hobby that is accessible to anyone who is interested. Getting started is not difficult. Probably the only really tough part is to decide what kind of photography you would like to focus on – while some people enjoy landscape photography, some specialize in portraits and some love children, nature and wildlife photography. 

Most aspiring photographers wistfully look at professional photographers’ magazines and journals wondering whether they can ever take pictures like those. Much of photography involves experimentation. The best part is, you do not need an expensive camera to indulge in photography as a hobby. In fact, these days with digital cameras, you don’t even have to spend thousands to print your pictures to see how they turned out. All you have to get is a decent camera, take as many pictures as you want and upload them to your computer to see how they look. Also you can make several adjustments to get the picture just the way you want it. So where do you begin once you decide that you want to take up photography as a hobby? 
Get Started As we said earlier, you do not need the most expensive camera to take good pictures. Ask any experienced photographer. And here’s a secret you must know – more than the camera, it is the photographer who clicks fantastic pictures. Some basic knowledge of how to expose a picture, how to focus and how to get the right angle is more important than the best camera. 

It is best to get started with one of those aim and shoot cameras, which can be upgraded with attachments like telephoto, wide angle lens and macro at no major cost. While there are plenty of traditional and digital cameras available, you must go with the one that you feel the most comfortable with, within your budget. Do a little research in terms of different types of cameras by visiting the stores and getting a feel of the cameras you like. There are excellent brands to choose from – Sony, Canon, Kodak, Casio, HP, Fuji, Minolta, Nikon, Pentax, Olympus – the choice is yours. These brands have models suitable for different budgets, experience levels and needs. The Internet is full of excellent resources on the topic and at the end of this article we will share the best ones with you. You will want to know how to choose the camera that is right for you, where to buy it, the kind of accessories you need, kinds of software in the market and how to print your photos when you want them.   
Learn The Basics Of Photography Getting a good camera does not guarantee fantastic pictures. It is best to equip yourself with some knowledge of the basic rules in photography. This can be done with books, videos and by talking to professional photographers. Get to know about how to compose, how to expose, shutter speed and camera settings, f numbers, zoom lens, techniques like getting the right lighting, using flash, etc. You can have great fun experimenting. Many people have an instinctive feel for the right time to click a photograph. But there are people who learn and go on to become great photographers. There are several online photography courses that teach you through virtual interactive lessons. 

Ultimately, you will become a good photographer only by going out there and shooting pictures. Here are some tips that will help you develop your photography skills. 

- Make sure you always carry your camera. Why miss some wonderful pictures simply because you forgot to bring your camera? 

- Get really familiar with your camera. Try out all the features it has, several times over. You don’t want to fumble when it comes to figuring out what that sign on your camera means when there is a really exclusive shot waiting to be taken. 

- The more pictures you shoot, the better you get. This is easier with a digital camera as the number of photos you can take is unlimited. Take several pictures of the same thing from different angles. Apart from preserving your memories, it helps you analyze how you can improve.

Backpacking Travel,"Backpacking Travel Information  Intro If you enjoy the outdoors and if you are looking for a hobby that is not expensive, backpacking is the right one for you. There are people who go backpacking all the time. The main thing is to check whether you are physically fit enough to set out on a trip. Backpacking is a healthy activity and it also gives you the chance to see places in a new perspective. Other than that, you get to travel, since you need not confine yourself to backpacking only on daytrips or overnight trips. 
Going About Preparing For Your Backpacking Trip The main thing about backpacking is the planning and preparation, before you get all excited and set off. Planning involves choosing where you want to go. Preparation means you must select your backpacking gear, get it all together and pack all the supplies you may need to make it a memorable trip. 
Where Do You Want To Go? First, make up your mind about where you want to go, as it will help get the right gear together. Perhaps you want to go backpacking for a week through a natural park or maybe you only want to go for an overnight trip. You will want to know about the weather so that you can decide when to go and pack accordingly. Next, you want to choose your trail, based on how experienced you are. Stick with well-known trails. If you are heading off to an international destination, you want to pick the international trails. A good map will be your best guide when you mark the routes you want to take, along with important landmarks. There are plenty of campsites that make life easier for the backpacker since they have facilities like showers, bathrooms and stores, so make sure you know where the ones on your route are located. It is also worthwhile to get in touch with other backpackers who go on trips regularly for useful information on what you can expect from a particular destination. You can meet other backpackers via message boards and online forums. Quite a few of these have realistic accounts of trips and experience, reviews of backpacking gear, tips, etc. There are also backpacking clubs where you can meet with backpackers who will be more than glad to help you plan a trip. 
Getting your gear together Choosing your gear is the starting point. But remember not to load up, or pick the wrong gear – the last thing you want is to be loaded down with unnecessary weight from things you will not use. Your backpack must carry gear that contributes to your comfort and safety. So while there is actually no such thing as the ideal backpacking gear, there is a list of things you must carry. Eventually, though, after a few trips, you will be able to decide about what works best for you. Some people also wisely rent or borrow whatever they want when they go backpacking the first time. This helps to decide on the right gear to buy and avoid getting stuff you may not need or use. So lets go ahead and make a list of what you will want! Your backpack will carry all your stuff. Depending on how long you are going to be away, and the kind of weather you will face, you want to choose the right kind of backpack. There are different types of backpacks – internal frame and external frames and the day backpacks. The external frame backpacks are good for big loads while the internal frame type is easier to handle, being smaller. Try on the backpack before you decide to buy it and make sure you get the right size. 
Here Is What You Will Need To Pack: • Water • Route maps with your program • Pocket knife • Flashlight with an extra set of batteries • Match box • A whistle • A paper pad and pencil • Digital Camera • Mobile phone (fully charged) • Sleeping bag for overnight trips • Photo ID • Extra clothing with an extra pair of socks • A first aid kit • Stove • Tent • Cash When you pack all these into your backpack, do it in a way that makes your backpack easy to carry. Spread the weight so that you are comfortable with it. Depending on the length of your trip, you can decide which of the above items you want to pack. Preferably, begin collecting what you need a few days before you plan to take off. If you intend being away for a week, you might want to become familiar with setting up a tent and using a stove if you are carrying one. Some people set off on backpacking trips that even last a few months, especially when they travel to a different country and then go backpacking. In such instances, they carry lists of youth hostels on the route. 
Some Useful Tips That Will Come In Handy • You want to make sure about the weather when you plan your trip. Sometimes there could be a sudden change in weather and it could spoil your trip. Also, heavy rains can actually be hazardous depending on the terrain you plan to cover. So keep a watch on the weather forecast. • Be aware of the laws of the area you intend to go backpacking in. Most backpacking areas have specific regulations to protect the environment and you would do well to respect it. • If you plan to visit a different country where you are unfamiliar with the language, carry a phrase book that will help you in basic communication and to read important signs. • Let your friends and family have a copy of your route map when you go backpacking. That said, backpacking takes an adventurous mindset, planning and preparation. It is best to begin with short trips and progress to longer ones so that you get more confident as you go along – physically as well as mentally. This should have you eager to get started with backpacking as a hobby.",
Bass Guitar,"Bass Guitar Information  Intro Lets see now, if you`re reading this, it becomes more than obvious that you`re interested in learning how to play the bass guitar. Okay, I totally agree that the bass guitar ain`t as fancy as the electric guitar or doesn`t drive the girls as wild as the singer does, but it does its importance in a band and when we say importance, we mean extremely vital like a super adhesive holding the band together. So if you want to pursue playing the bass guitar as a hobby, you`ll be happy to know that there is always a demand for good bassists the world over. Practice is the foundation of any art you want to pursue and the same goes for a bass guitar. 
Instrument Now that I know that you are eager to learn this instrument, lets get on with it shall we? The first thing that you have to know is well, your instrument of course. If you`re one of those lucky few who has been handed over a bass guitar but then as soon as you look at it, you wonder what all the parts are about, a good way to start is familiarizing yourself with it. The first thing that you`d obviously notice is the strings. A bass guitar commonly has four strings attached but if your instrument has got more, don`t start wondering as to what the hell are you holding in the first place. By default itself, your bass guitar should be tuned in the format of E, A, D and G, with E being the thickest string and G being the thinnest. We`d like to refer these strings, i.e., E, A, D, G as 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively to avoid any confusions. 

Then there are the frets that kind of divides your guitar vertically. Using these frets along with the strings helps you to play certain notes effortlessly. Another aspect that you have to know about is about the amplifications. Without them, you won`t be able to hear the sounds as clearly. Just as in the electric guitar, the bass guitar too uses the amplifiers so that you can hear the low pitch sounds quite as clearly. In fact there are amplifiers that are specifically made for bass guitars. 

Then you have the body, which is the large base of the guitar, the neck which is like the long, thin area which has the strings and the frets on it and of course the tuning pegs which are prevalent in all the guitars which allows you to adjust the pitch of the sound to be produced. So now that you know what your bass guitar consists of, its time that you start training. Its always advised that join some classes and learn to play your bass guitar from a good bassist. Take note of what your instructor is teaching you and never hesitate to ask for help if you think you`re going wrong somewhere. Remember that learning the bass guitar requires a lot of patience and if you intend to give it up just half way, then this hobby sure`s not for you. It requires dedication and a drive to learn more from your mistakes. 
Why Learn This hobby is like a hobby for life, because you just can`t get tired of it and hey, its one of those few habits that are good for your kids (provided they`re keeping their grades up in school). Practicing is the key to success in this case my friend, the sooner you`ll learn this, the faster you`ll be one with your guitar. You`ve also got to have a good ear for music and listen to bands playing on the radio, live shows or whatever. Once you get the hang of it, you will soon know that the bass guitarist and the drummer basically form the rhythm part of the band. Well, it is needless to say that the rhythm is everything in music. I mean c`mon, without the rhythm if you see your audience tapping their feet or nodding their head or something, well, you`re just in the wrong show then. 

So, if you are a bit clueless in the rhythm department, I`d advise you listen to some music ASAP. I tell you this because it`s important for you hear what exactly the bass guitarist is playing in the background so that you know how he is establishing the rhythm in the music. This means that you have to lend out your ears to the bass guitar and not just hear the song kind of passively, like most of us do at all times. There are certain types of music that would help you achieve this sense with genres like Funk, Rock and Soul music. Listening to complex rhythms is totally not going to help you especially to music like Salsa, African Drumming, etc. 

Train your body to follow the rhythm that you are playing. It could be anything, clapping, tapping your feet, nodding (not head banging at this stage you guys). The more you get the connection right, the better you`ll get at bass guitar playing. And once you get it right, turn off that music and start off with your practicing. Turn it on again and judge yourself to see if you`ve strayed from the rhythm or whether you`ve got it right. When you`ve got totally got into this hobby, start playing with your friends. I know, many would think otherwise that you should practice more to get to this level but its never too late. Even if you goof it up, all you have to do is practice a bit more. 

But I do advice that you start playing with your friends because it`s important that you learn that you aren`t playing solo all the time. It`s vital to follow the rhythmic cues left by other players to judge how far you`ve come towards playing the bass guitar. The session between the drummer and yourself is really important since as mentioned before, you are the two vital guys setting the rhythm in the first place. But then again, if you get cold feet and aren`t as confident, you can always turn towards the metronome which perfectly acts as your proxy drummer. 

Practice, practice, and practice even more. This requires you to set some time apart from your daily chores and devote some time towards playing this guitar, that`s why its your hobby isn`t it? Practice for about half an hour a day and make sure that you have no distractions around you. It is obvious that in the beginning, your arms and fingers will hurt when you start playing. So stretch your fingers and remember, the more you play, the stronger and faster your fingers will be able to adjust with the strings. Start out with the easy notes and then move on to the tough ones. Also, start out with a good body posture so that you don`t develop any back problems in the future. This is more evident due to the weight and size of your bass guitar. 

The bass guitar is a superb instrument, and playing bass is a perfect hobby due to the hours of enjoyment that it can provide. So once you`re all set up for it, grab that rugged instrument of yours and enjoy the music as it flows. While you`re at it, check out the following website that could give you some tips and ideas for playing the bass guitar.",
Turtles,"Turtles Information  Introduction Throughout North America, it has become quite common to find people that keep different turtle species as pets. They have been around for quite some time, and perhaps twenty years ago was the primary reptile people purchased, and they are still very popular today. The popularity of turtles is quite strange because on the whole, they are more difficult to take care of, but I’m sure the reason they were popular in the 80’s and 90’s is because of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. And yes, I loved the show as a child in the 80’s and yes, I did own turtles because of that show. Perhaps the only difference in modern times is that there are a significantly larger array of species to choose from, and on that list is the still quite expensive Tortoise. Although reptiles for the most part has not received the same negative stigma as snakes, the biggest question that is asked to people that keep reptiles as pets is “why?”. Of course the purpose of this article is to answer that very question, but the short and painless answer is that they are almost direct descendants of dinosaurs and they tell us a great deal of things in regards to the evolution of all animals. In other words, they are utterly fascinating. 

But if they are so unique and fascinating, why is it that their popularity is now just becoming mainstream? The answer is that there has always been, and perhaps always will be, an unknown or mysterious stigma associated with reptiles and that a majority of people just aren’t interested in anything but the mainstream cats and dogs. But the main reason there is such an influx of reptiles right now is because there are so many breeders producing a variety of reptiles that have never been available without being caught in the wild. And for those who have strong allergies to pets, reptiles are considered hypoallergenic because they have no hair or dander that most people suffer allergic attacks too. The fact is that reptiles make fantastic pets, and once you have one, you will definitely be hooked in the hobby for the rest of your life. 
Types of Turtles After hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, I have found it in my power to break down all turtles into two main categories based on their natural habitats. The two types of turtles that are found in the world today are turtles and tortoises. Yes, yes I know what you are thinking already. Tortoises are related to turtles, but they technically are not turtles as they’re needs are much more similar to lizards. Perhaps the hardest part about being part of this fascinating hobby is replicating the natural habitats of specific reptiles. Thankfully after decades of research, it is now possible to purchase nearly anything you could think of for nearly all reptile species from your home town pet store. Can’t find what you need at your pet store? Everything else that is too specific, or for things you pet store simply doesn’t carry, a quick search through the internet will get you anything you could think of for your pet. The best part about purchasing from the internet is that it is typically reptile hobbyists that are selling the products so that you can get help from people inside the hobby at any given time. 

The main difference between the two is that turtles spend a considerable time in water whereas Tortoises are generally land based animals. Tortoises, or land turtles are land-dwelling reptiles of the family of Testudinidae, order Testudines. Like their marine cousins, the sea turtles, tortoises are shielded from predators by a shell. The top part of the shell is the carapace, the underside is the plastron, and the two are connected by the bridge. The tortoise has both an endoskeleton and an exoskeleton. Tortoises can vary in size from a few centimeters to two meters. Tortoises are usually diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally reclusive animals. It is also interesting to note that there are a few species of tortoises that are in fact from deserts like the Desert Tortoise that is from the Mojave desert and Sonoran desert of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. 
Reptile Defenses Many small reptiles such as snakes and lizards which live on the ground or in the water are vulnerable to being preyed on by all kinds of carnivorous animals. Thus avoidance is the most common form of defense in reptiles. At the first sign of danger, most snakes and lizards crawl away into the undergrowth, and turtles and crocodiles will plunge into water and sink out of sight. Reptiles may also avoid confrontation through camouflage. Using a variety of grays, greens, and browns, these animals can blend remarkably well into the background of their natural environment. 

Unlike snakes that boast a large number of venomous species, there are actually only two types of reptiles that are actually venomous. And firstly, no, it is not the Komodo Dragon. Sure they are the largest reptiles in the world, aggressive towards humans, and a bite will act as if there is venom present, the truthful answer is that their mouths are full of harmful bacteria that acts like a venom if bitten. The only two reptiles that are venomous are actually cousins; The Gilas Monster and Beaded Lizard. Both have venom that can easily kill a human, but they are excessively violent and act more like a cross between a snake and a monitor lizard. 
Purchasing Your First Turtle/Tortoise The first rule about purchasing your first turtle is to buy a species that is interesting to you. Never be persuaded to purchase an animal that you don’t want because you are told it is an easier animal meant for a beginner. If it is a turtle that you don’t really want, then it is a turtle that you will grow tired of in the future. Regardless of what type it is that you want, you have to ensure you do all the research about it prior to purchasing it so that you take proper care of the turtle or tortoise from day one. There is simply no sense in getting an animal that will grow to be 4 feet around and requires a room and full lake to live in if you are living in an apartment. The idea that any animal will grow to the size of its enclosure is a myth, and the fact is that if they live in an enclosure too small their growth will be stunted and they will suffer from health issues. 

One of the most debated issues in all of herpetology is whether to purchase from a private breeder or from a pet store. Here is an argument that is based on a few too many bad apples spoiling it for the bunch. Without pet stores, there simply would not be reptiles, snake, and amphibians in captivity as pets because it was various pet stores that sparked the interest in reptiles in the first place. But over the past twenty years, there have been numerous cases of reptiles being sold by people thinking only of profit as their reptiles suffered from neglect. Thankfully, there has been numerous reptile enthusiasts stepping forward to challenge pet stores to live up to the standards that reptile require, and there have also been numerous pet stores in North America that have been promoting proper reptile care. The downside to purchasing from a pet store is that you will be paying higher prices because the pet store purchases from breeders and then mark up the prices to make a profit. Sometimes you will find unique snakes in pet stores, but for the most time, they are usually the run of the mill whereas, if you purchase from a breeder, you may be able to get a more unique morph that most people have never seen before. 

As a general rule of thumb, always try to purchase the healthiest specimen available. This is easily done by purchasing the largest animal in a group, in which most turtles and reptiles are kept, that has bright eyes and is active. Larger animals typically mean that they are being well fed and cared for. If a reptile is skinny and not active, then it is best to leave it be. One of the most common reasons for buying a small sickly animal from either a breeder or pet store is because you want to save it and nurse it back to health. Although noble your intentions might be, a life time of health issues will not make you love your new pet any more, and health issues in reptiles are incredibly difficult to treat especially if it is young and has yet to build up a resistance to illnesses. A healthy turtle can live many years, and if you put in the time that is necessary, you will be rewarded in the long run. In fact, a healthy well cared for tortoise can out live you three times over if we take Adwaita, a male Aldabra giant tortoise in the Alipore Zoological Gardens of Kolkata, India, for example because he just dies in 2006 at the reported age of 250, which was disputed until his shell was carbon dated and said to be approximately 255 years old. 
Required Equipment All turtles and tortoises regardless of species require three main things to ensure that they not only survive, but thrive in their new home. The first thing that all reptiles require is an enclosure that is big enough for them to easily move about in, but also large enough to mimic a part of their natural ecosystem. In the case of turtles, they actually require a large aquarium with approximately one half water and one half substrate. For tortoises that are land dwelling, they require small aquariums that need to be enlarged as they grow. Full sandboxes are often used to hold tortoises. Depending on the type of turtle or tortoise, there are numerous types of substrate available for your specific pet ranging from different types of sand for desert tortoises to various types wood mulches for subtropical pets. You just have to remember to always avoid oak and cedar because they have oils that are toxic to most snake species. Unlike all other reptile species, turtles and tortoises are generally terrible climbers, so tight fitting lids over the enclosures are not requires. Should your tortoise jump out, call me, because I would love to see it happen. 

The second thing to remember about turtles and tortoises is that they are all cold blooded, so they require an external heat source to keep their bodies warm. A heat range of 75 to 80 Fahrenheit will suffice for a majority of reptiles, but certain desert species will require significantly higher temperatures in the 120’s to maintain their metabolism. This heat for turtles and tortoises are generally from an external reptile heat bulb to heat the cage from above because they really love to bask for a majority of the day. It is also important to heat only one half of the cage give the reptile a chance to regulate its body temperature by being able to move from one side of the cage to another. 

The last thing you have to remember is that turtles and tortoises like to have a safe and secure place to retreat to should they desire. They do this by crawling underneath things that they can push up against and feel safe. The easiest way to do this is to purchase reptile hides from a pet store that look like big hollow rocks that your snake can climb under. These are the easiest to use, most effective, and the safest. Some people choose to use real rocks, which are alright, but you have to ensure they cannot be pushed over because they could injure small sized turtles. 
Conclusion Although reptiles are one of the most misunderstood pet on the market today, for some reason or another, people have always made a strong connection to turtles and tortoises. They are simply unlike any other pet you could ever think of, and they are perhaps one of the last links to the dinosaurs that used to roam the world. The moment a turtle is in your house, the hobby envelops you in a way you would never expect. Half the fun is recreating a natural habitat for your pet whether it is a species of turtle or tortoise. I can probably state as a fact that all private breeders at one time or another were just like you or me, and picked up their first pet turtle just because of their uniqueness, and maybe because of a famous cartoon show, but the interest quickly turns into a passion. The simple fact that they make fantastic pets for people of all ages and both sexes. Just when you think they have no personality, they will find a way to surprise you and make you rethink the way you look at these animals forever. And there is no time like the present to get into the hobby because due to the large number of breeders throughout North America, the general price of turtles have gone down significantly , but over the last twenty years there has been a strong emergence of tortoises in the pet industry. The fantastic thing about tortoises is that different species come in a variety of sizes and colors that will make you fall in love. You just always have to do your research to ensure that you pet is getting the perfect habitat, perfect diet, and perfect lighting/heating. Plus you have to check your local municipality, state/province, and federal legislation to ensure there are no laws restricting these fantastic little guys.",
Vinyl Records,"Vinyl Records InformationTHE MAGIC OF THE VINYL RECORDVinyl records are considered among the original storage media that took the world by storm decades ago. Today, even though we have the CD, MP3, DVD, Blue ray, etc., vinyl records continue to charm everyone. Musicians and fans alike are passionate about having their music recorded on vinyl records. In spite of the popularity and convenience of streaming and MP3 and online downloads where you can carry with you thousands of songs in your pocket, Vinyl records still have a solid fan following among those who cherish them as well as among those who have just discovered them. The exciting full length LPs of the ‘60s and ‘70s are attracting young and old alike. So read up below on the vinyl basics and get started. A great thing, as far as music companies are concerned, about vinyl records, is that you cannot download them illegally. Many of today’s music artists are releasing their music on vinyl records in addition to CD and MP3 formats. Record labels also throw in free MP3 downloads with these albums so that the generation next can enjoy both – great sound at home with the vinyl and also carry their music as MP3 when they are mobile.

Vinyls are especially attractive for their unusual shapes and artistic design and current presentations are geared to appeal to the current listeners. New records are available at around $ 14. Amazingly you can expect to get used LPs, depending on its condition, for as little as a penny. If it is a collectible, there are avid collectors who will not hesitate to part with thousands of dollars to acquire it, particularly if it is autographed by the artist.BUT WHY DO PEOPLE COLLECT VINYL RECORDS?There are several reasons why people collect vinyl records. For some, it is an obsession – the thrill of getting hold of that rare record they have always wanted. There are garage sales, flea markets, rummage sales etc where records are sold all over America. Album art covers are major collectibles among fans. There are classics like the Beatles’, Janis Joplin, and Led Zeppelin etc. that are considered great treasures. There are 45-rpm vinyl record sleeves that are considered more valuable than the actual vinyl record. These sleeves are majestically framed, displayed or just lovingly preserved.Some also see vinyl records as an investment. On websites like eBay, millions of vinyl records are auctioned off each year. The most appealing thing about a vinyl record is its sound quality and then, of course there is the appreciation in value over time. Many people collect vinyl for its nostalgia value too. Limited editions are especially sought after, with colored vinyl, picture discs, 180-220 gram audiophile records, and album artwork coming close behind. So it is not really surprising that today’s generation also finds vinyl records as appealing as those who might have been crazy about them in the 1960’s or 70’s.Vinyl record trading is major business today. On eBay alone, you will find something like six thousand collectible Beatles’ albums for sale – all being sold for huge amounts. Artists like the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Madonna, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Elvis Presley, Led Zeppelin are the most preferred along with Motown records, blues recordings, jazz, punk and vinyl from other genres as well. Artists like John Lennon and Peter Buck of REM own massive collections that include rare, original vinyl records.VINYL RECORDS – SOME FEATURESWhen vinyl records were first introduced, they were seen as the unbreakable alternative to the shellac records that would easily break. Incidentally, vinyl records are popular not just because they can be reproduced or stored easily; the record covers and sleeves were also considered highly collectible too. It was possible to compile songs on 12-inch discs called albums. Small connections were compiled on EP or extended play records.Now lets look at some of the characteristics of vinyl records and get to know them better:
SpeedYou will generally find vinyl records at speeds of 16, 33, 45 and 78 rpm or rotations per minute. This basically means that these records must be played at that speed on the turntable to listen to the music the way it is meant to sound. Actually the 16 and 78 records were made decades ago at a time when there was no standard record size and are rather rare today. You will most likely come across the 33 and 45 RPM vinyl records.SizeVinyl records can be of 7, 10 or 12 inches where 7 and 10 inches are usually used in single play or SP recordings or singles. The 12-inch discs are the LPs or long playing records.TimeThis is a combination of the vinyl record’s size and speed because they determine the amount of music on the disc. If size is small and rpm is high, the record will spin faster. LP records play for longer – for over 25 minutes per side, making for roughly 50 minutes of music. All LPs are 33 rpm and 12-inch records. The SP or single play records usually have around two songs per side and are 7 inches with 45 rpm. So you’ll get about 6 minutes of music each side. There are maxi SP records that are 12 inch SPs and these are usually used in songs that run to twelve minutes a side. 10 inch SPs are uncommon. There are 33 rpm SPs, though.MaterialYou might assume that vinyl records are black in color, but some record companies do release limited edition color vinyl records that can be red, gray, white, blue, purple, etc. In fact you may even come across colorless see-through records. While there’s barely any difference in sound when you compare the color vinyl with the black, some people feel that color tends to get damaged more easily than black. Quite a few DJs use color vinyl to release their work. As we mentioned earlier, you will also find picture discs. Picture discs essentially have a picture or some kind of art on the sides rather than the plain black. These come in see-through covers so that the art is visible. These used to be rare and limited editions, although these days they are easily available.MassA vinyl record’s mass plays a crucial role in the way it plays. Almost all SPs come with the same mass. LPs weigh 120 grams, though some audiophile vinyl records are heavier and could be even 200 grams. You can safely assume that the heavier the record, the more its volume since the grooves are deeper and so, sounds a lot better. These also do not damage easily. Incidentally, most foreign 45-rpm singles were vinyl pressings while the US records are pressed on plastic.HOW VINYL RECORDS ARE GRADED
Vinyl records and covers are graded to describe the condition they are in. There is no actual standard as such. However, the following terminology is used popularly:Mint or M – brand new with all album extras intactExcellent or Ex – almost new, rarely played. Could have slightly worn coverVery good or VG – used record, but in great condition and good sound quality. Possibly some scratching but no major defectsGood or G – slightly lower sound quality due to frequent playing, possibly with scratches and scuffed cover.Fair or F – a just about playable record with a damaged cover. Can probably be restoredPoor or P – not good sound quality, damaged cover, barely playable from the scratchingBad or B – broken or almost impossible to play record Often the record’s edition makes an impact. For those who are not keen on seriously looking around, there are the new releases. The best thing is a record company that releases new vinyl record pressings from the master tapes of an album for the best sound quality.

Quite a few records were released in the 50’s and 60’s were mono recordings and later released again as stereo records. Monos are quite rare since all later editions were stereo.WHAT EQUIPMENT DO YOU NEED TO PLAY VINYL?Once you get hold of vinyl records, you would basically need a turntable, an amp and speakers. The earlier model turntables have all the necessary features like speakers, amps and RCA jacks built in. The speakers connect to the amp to complete the sound system. Turntables are generally component type hi-fi equipment where you would need to connect an external amplifier or receiver. If there is no phono input on your turntable you will need to buy a phono preamp.VINYL, MP3s AND CDsThere is no getting away from the fact that vinyl records have a charm all their own that is impossible to duplicate. MP3s are certainly easier to carry around since you can fit a massive collection into a hand held player. MP3s are definitely convenient. But then, nothing can compare to the joy of holding and playing a rare vinyl record. There’s a thrill when you slide it out of its sleeve and listen to all the crackles, pops and hisses that only add to the excitement. Ask any vinyl record collector. Record sleeves alone give rise to a variety of feelings with their innovative design. It is a fact that the sense of adventure you feel with vinyl is simply lacking with MP3s or CDs.Vinyl records have a far warmer sound compared to MP3s, CDs and digital downloads. With MP3 if the compression has been done in a low-resolution format, then it could sound tinny.Apart from the above, vinyl records come with extra perks. The album art, pullout photos, and even full size posters are big attractions. In fact, the alternative rock genre vinyl records actually had 16 page booklets that were big collectibles. You will also find bonus tracks on some LPs that you wont find on the CD version, which is definitely extra value. Most of all, vinyl records are more socially interactive as you can see, feel and relate with their physical presence with your friends while enjoying the music.The good news, naturally, is that you can actually get your vinyl records on to your computer hard drive with a turntable. This turntable lets you plug and play into your computer with a USB interface to produce sound files identical to the vinyl recordings. You can then transfer them to your iPod and carry them around or just enjoy them from your pc.WHERE CAN YOU BUY VINYL RECORDS?You can find vinyl records at your local music store, flea markets, thrift shops, garage or rummage sales, etc. Online, on eBay, there are plenty of mass sellers who auction them. The best bets are collectors who sell from their collection since they are usually in the best condition.LOOKING AFTER YOUR VINYL RECORD COLLECTIONYou should always store your vinyl records in a vertical standing position on a shelf. Do not ever stack them horizontally as they will damage the discs and the covers because of the weight. Vinyl records must be stored in a moisture free place. It goes without saying that they must not be exposed to sunlight or cigarette smoke as they could get warped. Thus – in short – vinyl records must be kept free from heat and moisture. Preferably handle your records by only touching the edge or center where the label is. Avoid touching the grooves.Records can be cleaned with a soft micro fiber cloth to keep them free from dust and dirt. Your turntable’s stylus must also be occasionally cleaned with a stylus brush according to the instructions that came with your equipment. And of course, your record covers and sleeves must also be taken care of. Keep your album covers in a plastic sleeve – who knows, you might be sitting on a fortune! There are collectors who frame their rare album covers beautifully to display them as wall art.POPULAR VINYL GENRESCurrently, the most popular vinyl genres, according to Amazon, which sells something like 150,000 titles across more than twenty genres on vinyl, are alternative rock and classic rock. The high-resolution vinyl format has a huge fan following. You will find vinyl in almost all genres – some sites specialize in selling modern jazz, bebop, pre ’75 R&B, psychedelic, Motown, blues, soul, funk, progressive rock and so on. The most popular classic rock artists are the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, etc. The most loved soul artists on vinyl are James Brown, Funkadelic, quite a few Motown and Stax labels, psychedelic artists and British invasion groups. Most collectors go for are blues, jazz, classic rock and classical records.CONCLUSIONThe great thing about vinyl records is that they are a part of the unforgettable rock and roll age and a cherished part of pop culture. Collecting, storing, restoring and preserving of vinyl records is like actually having a piece of the artist, the music and the memory of times gone by. In addition to this, it is a fact that vinyl sounds truly genuine. Because of the way it is recorded, vinyl brings a warm sound reproduction that is unmatched by digital MP3s or CDs. Vinyl is certainly here to stay.",
Croquet,"Croquet Information Introduction Croquet is a competitive team sport that is also enjoyed via informal games held in backyards across the world. Croquet is a popular past-time in which players hit wooden or plastic balls through wire hoops stuck into a grass court. Those grass courts can be lawns where friends and family play the game for recreational purposes in backyards or parks, or formal grass lawns where players vie during competitive tournaments. 

Croquet is played on a flat lawn that is mowed short. Artificial surfaces are rarely used for the sport. Croquet is played by people of both genders and all ages. Unlike many sports, men and women compete together and are ranked together. While there are some exceptions, the croquet “season” generally runs between spring and fall. 

Playing croquet offers effective yet gentle exercise. The United States Croquet Association estimates that players walk more than two miles during an average match. 

Croquet is enjoyed around the globe, but it is particularly popular in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. 

The gentility and picturesque aspects of croquet have captured the imaginations of artists who have portrayed the sport in literature and paintings. 
Croquet Clubs Beginners can learn to play at croquet clubs or they can take classes often offered by park districts. There are croquet clubs worldwide. Croquet provides camaraderie among aficionados all over the world. Players vacationing in a foreign land will get a warm welcome if they choose to visit the local croquet club. 

Most croquet clubs are affiliated with a national croquet association. Those national associations are affiliated with the World Croquet Federation. The WCF promotes the sport internationally and oversees world championships. Players who are serious about the sport will likely want to join a croquet club. Club membership offers many benefits including a ready pool of like-minded individuals for both formal competitions and informal games. Club memberships also grant access to croquet facilities and well-tended lawns for competition. 
Practice Tips Here are some helpful tips that croquet players can use to build skills and refine their game. 

• Be sure to learn the correct form for a particular stroke or shot before practicing. Otherwise there is a danger of ingraining bad croquet habits that could be difficult to overcome. A coach can be helpful in providing guidance on correct posture, grip and other aspects. • Keep practice sessions short. Expert croquet players believe that two or three half-hour practices each week are preferable to one lengthy, tiring session. • Swing the mallet from your shoulders in a pendulum motion. Don’t swing the mallet from your wrists. • Practice unfamiliar moves. Don’t concentrate exclusively on moves you already know how to perform. • Find a comfortable, natural grip on the mallet. The mallet should not rotate when you tighten the grip. Adopt a posture with good balance. Don’t lean forward too far. Be careful to position your feet so that the mallet can be drawn back completely without striking your ankle or foot. • Focus on practicing one particular shot during each session. That allows you to concentrate more fully on refining that technique. • Keep your head down during a swing. Don’t lift your head until after the ball is hit. Raising your head too soon causes your shoulders to move and thus spoils the shot. • Build confidence by first practicing moves that you already know how to do. Then broaden your practice sessions by refining unfamiliar shots and skills. • Set simple goals for each practice session. This also helps boost your confidence. • Take time to practice moves that are rarely used in croquet games. Knowing how to perfectly execute these lesser-used moves could make a big difference during a game. • Enlist the services of a personal croquet coach. If that’s impossible, partner with a helpful friend or a fellow croquet player. The two of you can observe each other’s techniques and offer feedback. 
Croquet Equipment Beginners wishing to buy croquet equipment should decide at what level they want to play the game. The equipment used in a friendly, backyard game during a summer picnic is not the same gear that will be used in a competitive event or tournament. The price and quality of croquet equipment varies widely depending on the desired level of play. 

Croquet equipment can be divided into three general categories: lightweight and inexpensive toy sets, adult-size sets and tournament-quality gear. The lightweight and inexpensive toy sets are scaled for children. Adult-size sets are in the middle ground between toy equipment and tournament-quality gear. Tournament-quality croquet equipment is the kind of high-quality gear used by players at croquet clubs worldwide. 

Jaques of London, a well-known provider of croquet equipment, sells croquet sets ranging from $80 to $5,775. 

The equipment needed to play croquet includes metal wickets or hoops, mallets, balls, pegs or stakes, flags, wicket clips and string and boundary settings. 

The standard croquet mallet generally has a square head that’s 9 to 11 inches long. Standard mallets weigh three pounds with a shaft that is 36 inches long. Mallets should have a lightweight shaft with a heavy head. 

The primary colors for croquet balls are blue, red, black and yellow. The term first colors are used for these balls. The secondary colors for balls, also referred to as second colors, are green, brown, pink and white. 

Balls for competitive play must weigh 1 pound, although that can fluctuate up or down by a quarter-ounce. Croquet balls for informal play can weigh less than a pound. 

Croquet pegs or stakes should stand 18 inches above ground with a uniform diameter of 1.5 inches above the soil. 

Hoops or wickets should stand 12 inches above the ground. The hoops should be sturdily embedded into the lawn so that they remain straight when knocked by balls during a game. 

Croquet flags are typically linen on a stake. They are usually blue, red, and black and yellow, the same as the primary colors for croquet balls. 

Wicket clips are the same colors as the croquet balls. Wicket clips mark the next wicket to be made by the specified color of ball.

Conclusion Croquet in its many varieties is a genteel sport which offers the benefits of fun, good exercise and camaraderie. Those advantages are reaped whether the players are enjoying an informal game in someone’s backyard during a summer picnic or battling in a formal tournament under the auspices of a croquet association. 

Croquet’s popularity worldwide is undoubtedly boosted by the fact that it can be played by players of all ages and both genders. Strategic thinking is just one of the skills necessary to become a successful croquet player.",
Liquor Distillation,"Liquor Distillation Information  Introduction to Liquor Distilling Your friends are sitting in your living room after dinner. You break out a bottle of your very own aged whiskey. As your friends sample your delicious concoction, you beam with pride knowing that you are the craftsman. 

Liquor distilling is an art form. Unlike the homebrewing of beer and wine, liquor distilling requires more equipment and a little extra effort before the final results are produced. This hobby requires patience and excellent organizational skills. You will learn from your mistakes and, over time, develop your own recipes and techniques. 

This hobby can be expensive. Rather than spend over a thousand dollars on equipment on day one, piece together your collection. Each piece of your home distillery can be replaced with more efficient, more expensive equipment as you get more involved in the hobby.  
Distilled Liquors For centuries, homeowners have produced their own wines, beers, and liquors. Homebrewing and homedistilling are very different. Distilled liquors are essentially a result of additional processing of a fermented liquid. In fact, fermented mash is termed “beer” in many guides. A distilled beverage, liquor, or spirit is a drinkable liquid containing ethanol that is produced by distilling fermented grain, fruit, or vegetables. This excludes undistilled fermented beverages such as beer, wine, and hard cider.  
Distillation The process of distillation makes liquor distilling unique. Some knowledge of chemistry is helpful when beginning a home distillery. Prior to beginning a home distillery, research the distillation process to ensure that you fully understand the chemical processes taking place during distillation. A clear understanding of the process itself will allow you to fine tune your equipment and produce a better product. Distillation is a method of separating mixtures based on differences in their volatilities in a boiling liquid mixture. Distillation is a unit operation, or a physical separation process, and not a chemical reaction. 
Liquor Distillation Today In a world where watermelon vodka and nail-polish remover flavored whiskey clog the shelves of liquor stores, it is difficult to find true quality in a liquor. Alcohol consumption today is higher than ever before. Fortunately, the appreciation for excellent flavor and quality is not lost. Liquor tasting itself is a hobby. Some people spend years hunting for the perfect bourbon or the most exquisitely flavored scotch. 

The basic process of distillation has not changed since the 8th century. Freeze distillation also remained in limited use, for example during the American colonial period applejack was made from cider using this method. There have been many changes in the methods used to prepare organic material for the still, and the ways the distilled beverage is finished and marketed. 

Knowledge of the principles of sanitation and access to standardised yeast strains have improved the quality of the base ingredient; larger, more efficient stills produce more product per square foot and reduce waste; ingredients such as corn, rice, and potatoes have been called into service as inexpensive replacements for traditional grains and fruit. For tequila, the blue agave plant is used. 

Chemists have discovered the scientific principles behind aging, and have devised ways to accelerate aging without introducing harsh flavors. Modern filters have allowed distillers to remove unwanted residue and produce smoother finished products. Most of all, marketing has developed a worldwide market for distilled beverages among populations that previously did not drink spirits.  
Modern Microdistilling In the quest for the perfect alcohol, many turn to home or micro distillation. The microdistillery movement is growing in the United States. These companies are paving the way for the home distillery. A microdistillery is a small, often `boutique`, distillery. While the term is most commonly used in the United States, micro-distilleries have been established in Europe for many years, either as small cognac distilleries supplying the larger cognac houses, or as distilleries of single malt whiskey originally produced for the blended Scotch whisk market, but whose products are now sold as niche single malt brands. 
Getting Started Before you begin, decide which route you plan to take. You can build your equipment at fairly low cost or you can spend a little more for professional equipment. Determine which type of alcohol you plan to make and design your equipment to suit the alcohol best. 

Choose your location well. You will need a ventilated space with plenty of room for cooking, fermentation, and distillation. You will need a rodent free area to store your ingredients. 

The process of creating your own liquor is not overly complex. Careful attention to detail will result in delicious results. 

There are many books available that discuss still construction in detail. Others contain recipes and distillation techniques. You can also find forums where other distillers compare notes, share recipes and tips, and troubleshoot.  
Types of Distilled Liquors Every region of the world has a liquor unique to the area. With the right recipe, you can successfully duplicate almost any liquor. Some liquors are more simple to make than others. The following list of liquors can be produced with good results in a home distillery. 

• Whiskey (includes Scotch & Bourbon): Distilled grain mash. 

• Rum: Rum distilled from light sugar, dark sugar, or molasses. 

• Brandy: Distilled fruit, usually grapes. 

• Applejack: Distilled from fresh and rotten apples. 

• Schnapps: Fermented fruit liquor. Apples, grapes, cherries, pears, plums, and peaches are common. Schnapps can also be used to describe a flavored alcohol. 

• Vodka: Flavorless liquor made from anything, primarily grain or potatoes. 

• Gin: Grain alcohol flavored with juniper berries. 

• Everclear and Moonshine: Pure grain alcohol. 

Not all liquors are simple to distill at home. Tequila, from the agave plant, is difficult to make. Sake is also more difficult. This liquor is made from rice. 

As you gain experience, you can add ingredients or experiment with different combinations to create your own flavors and versions of the above liquors. The sky is the limit once you master the basic steps of liquor distillation. 
Equipment & Supplies To set up your distillery, you will need to set up four areas. The first area is where you will cook your mash. The second area is where fermentation takes place. The third area is the distillery. The final area is for storage of ingredients and the finished product. Your cooking area needs to have a heat source, measuring tools, mixing tools, and pots. The storage area should be cool, dry, and out of direct sunlight. 

Your fermentation and distillation areas require more technical equipment.  
Mash Fermentation Tank Your fermentation tank is where the carbohydrate/sugar mix is converted into alcohol. The tank must allow for anaerobic fermentation to take place. This is fermentation without the addition of oxygen. 

Almost any sealed, watertight tank will work well as a fermentation tank. A five gallon bucket with a sealed lid will suffice. 

• A plastic tank will work best for small batches. 

• Glass is also a great option but it breaks easily and, if kept outdoors, will kill the yeast. 

• Stainless steel and copper tanks are excellent for large batches. 

• Finally, a wooden tank can be made with little expense. However, this tank must be lined with something that is alcohol resistant. 

The container must be larger than than the batch you plan to make. For example, if you plan to make 2 gallons of liquor, you will need a fermentation tank that will hold at least 32 gallons. 

You will need to add a spigot to the base of your tank for easy draining of your alcohol. In addition to the spigot, you need to make a fermentation lock of some sort. This is as simple as a hose leading from the tank to a jar of water. This prevents oxygen from entering the tank as carbon dioxide leaves the tank.  
Distillation Apparatus There are many types of stills. The two stills you are likely to use are the pot still and the column still. Pot stills are traditional in whiskeys and most grain alcohols. A column still eliminates most flavor and results in a higher proof alcohol. 

Your still can be made or bought. Regardless of which way you choose to get your still, you need to have the same key features. 

• Boiler: The alcohol begins the distillation process in this tank. The shape and size don`t matter but the tank does need to be made of metal. Copper and stainless steel work very well. 

• Column/Cap: The first step of condensation. Traps the water vapor before it travels any further through the still. Your column should provide lots of extra surface area to promote condensation. This can be done with a packed column or a plate column. 

• Condensing Coils: Alcohol vapor becomes liquid alcohol as it travels through this coil. 

• Cooling System: This cools the air around the condensing coils allowing the alcohol vapor to become liquid. 

• Collection Equipment: Collects the liquid alcohol and begins the denaturing process. This container should be made of metal. The smaller the mouth, the better. Less vapor will be lost.  
Safety Features No gauge should come in contact with liquid. Water is not explosive or likely to build up pressure. All of the controls on your still should measure the vapor. 

• Temperature Gauge: Water boils at a higher temperature than alcohol. If the temperature increases, there are fewer alcohol vapors and your run is nearing its end. 

• Blowout pressure valves reduce the chances of a still explosion. 

• A pressure gauge will allow you to turn off your still in case of a blockage.  
Ingredients Regardless of which type of alcohol you choose to make, you will need a few core ingredients. These ingredients are essential to the creation of a good alcohol. 

• Yeast 

• Water 

• Malt Grains: corn, wheat, barley, rye, rice 

• Vegetables: potatoes, beets 

• Fruits: Apples, pumpkins, cherries, pears, peaches, plums, grapes 

• Sugars: white sugar, sugar cane, molasses, brown sugar, honey 

You can experiment with different ingredients as you gain experience. Basically, anything with sugar or carbohydrates that can be broken down into simple sugars will work to make alcohol.  
Storage Containers You will need a collection of glass bottles with lids or caps that create a good seal. Ball jars work well. Bottles with screw on caps also serve as excellent storage containers for finished alcohol. 

If you find a bottling system you like, you could even create your own labels. 
Procedures & Mixtures Distilling liquor is a multiphase process. The chemical reactions that take place within each step allow the next step to take place. The steps are as follows: 

• Carbohydrates are converted to sugars during the preparation of the mash. 

• Fermentation converts the sugars to alcohol. 

• The alcohol is then distilled to create the liquor.  
Making Mash Plan to spend several hours making each batch of mash. Bacteria and acid will ruin your mash so sterilization and proper cleaning are important before and after every batch. 

There are several ways to make mash. Some involve sprouting grains to convert the carbohydrates to sugar. Others are more time consuming but less complicated. You can find a myriad of recipes for mash online. You will eventually figure out the recipe that works best for you. 

Most of the liquors you will make will be made from grains, potatoes, or fruit. Here is an example of a mash recipe that will work well for all three types: The ratio of grain to malt is 3:1. Use 37 gallons of water for every 8 dry gallons of the grain/malt mixture. 

Corn 

Cook cracked corn without malt for 30 minutes and let sit 24 hours in an open container. Add the malt and stir well. 

Potatoes 

Repeat the steps above but use a 5 to 1 ratio of potato to grain malt. Cook the potatoes in water for 1 hour. Cool the mix to room temperature and add the malt. 

Applejack 

You can use apples in almost any condition. All you need to do is juice the apples and ferment without malt. Add yeast if you choose.  
Fermentation This step converts the sugars created in the previous step to alcohol. 

Once the cooked ingredients are below 90 degrees, they can be added to the fermentation tank. Add a live yeast mixture to the mash. Close the lid and put all hoses in place. Ferment for 24 hours and check for fermentation. 

Leave the tank to ferment for three days. Remove a sample and test with a hydrometer for the alcohol content. Close the tank and allow to ferment until the ideal alcohol level is reached. This can take anywhere from 10 days to 30 days.  
Distillation Once your mash is fermented to your satisfaction, you can begin the fun. 

The proof of an alcohol is double the percentage of alcohol. For example, a liquor that is 50% alcohol is 100 proof. Your still will produce alcohol that ranges in proof from 160 to 190. You can raise the proof of the alcohol by filtering the finished product through charcoal. 

• Fill the boiler with the fermented liquid. DO NOT overfill as you need room for boiling and evaporation. 

• Light the boiler once you have added the liquid. Alcohol boils at 173 degrees Fahrenheit and water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The alcohol will vaporize first, leaving the water and any impurities behind. 

• The first 2 to 3 quarts should be set aside as they will contain methanol. 

• Once the alcohol is mostly evaporated, the temperature of the water vapor will begin to rise. At this point, you will have finished the distillation run. Any further distillation will force water vapor through the system. 

• If something doesn`t seem right, turn everything off. Clean and maintain your still to increase its longevity and reduce the risk of an accident. 

• The solution left after a distillation run can be saved for another run. 

Do not leave your still unattended. You are working with a pressurized system filled with flammable liquid and gas. The last thing you need is an explosion. 
Safety Aside from the risk of an explosion, poorly or improperly made alcohol can contain a variety of harmful components. Failure to use quality materials or ingredients can result in health problems for everyone who consumes the contaminated product. While instances of lead poisoning or other illnesses are less common than in the days of bootleggers, the risk of illness is always present when you take shortcuts or use equipment or ingredients that are not of food grade. 

For example, badly-produced moonshine can be contaminated with toxins, mainly from materials used in construction of the still. Stills employing used automotive radiators as a condenser are particularly dangerous; in some cases, glycol products from antifreeze used in the radiator can appear as well. Radiators used as heaters also may contain lead at the connections to the plumbing. Both glycol and lead are poisonous and potentially deadly. 

Although methanol is not produced in toxic amounts by fermentation of sugars from grain starches, contamination is still possible by unscrupulous distillers using cheap methanol to increase the apparent strength of the product. Moonshine can be made both more palatable and less damaging by discarding the ""foreshot""--the first few ounces of alcohol that drip from the distiller. The foreshot contains most of the methanol, if any, from the mash. Methanol may be present because it vaporizes at a lower temperature than ethanol. The foreshot also typically contains small amounts of other undesirable compounds such as acetone and various aldehydes. 

Any alcohol that is at least 80 US proof (i.e. 40% alcohol by volume) is flammable. This is especially true during the distilling process in which vaporized alcohol can accumulate in the air if there is not enough ventilation. 
Government Regulations Around the world, the government regulation of distilleries is present. Very few countries allow personal distilleries. Those that do permit home distillation often limit the quantity and strength of the alcohols produced. 

Before you begin your liquor distilling hobby, check your local laws. If you are required to have a permit, complete the necessary paperwork. While the idea of being a “moonshiner” might seem like an adventure, the legal repercussions of violating a distillation law will soon change your mind.",
Astrology,"Astrology Information  Intro Astrology is an intriguing subject. It is really thrilling to know the effect of various planets, constellations, the sun and the moon on our lives. Astrology is a study of all this and much more. It also tells you about your spiritual connection to an entity in the higher plane. If you are interested in cultivating astrology as your hobby then you have come to the right place. Here you are going to learn about the various concepts and symbols used, which will build a strong base for your in-depth astrological study. 
Types of Astrology Out of the various types of astrology, the ones that were most famous in the bygone years were Horary, Mundane and Natal. Horary Astrology was used to determine auspicious time of action, Mundane was used to predict disasters and Natal, the more famous one, was used to determine the type of personality one possesses, with the help of natal or birth charts. This form of astrology is in use till date. Current traditions in astrology are Vedic Astrology, Western Astrology and Chinese astrology (exists in different forms, in different places). 

Both, Vedic Astrology and Western astrology, have a common ancestry. Both of them cast a horoscope or astrological chart that represents celestial bodies like the Sun, the Moon, the planets and constellations of stars. The basic difference between these two types is that Vedic astrology is based on Sidereal zodiacs, where the zodiacs are linked to their original constellations, whereas Western astrology is based on tropical zodiacs. The 12 zodiac signs of western astrology do not correspond to their original constellations. But in Vedic astrology, it is this very position that is of prime importance. Additionally, in Vedic astrology nakshatras or lunar mansions and dashas or planetary periods are also important. 

In Chinese astrology, the 12 signs of the zodiac are not for the positions of the celestial bodies in the sky, but on the celestial equator. In Chinese astrology the signs correspond to one of the two sets of 12 hours in a day and also to one of the 12 months. Each year is governed by a sign and combines with a system that is based on 5 elements of Chinese cosmology, which gives rise to a cycle of 60 years. 
Birth Chart Birth Chart is the map of the Sun, the Moon and the planets at the exact place and moment of birth. For simplification, only these heavenly bodies are included in the birth chart, though one can also include other heavenly bodies like asteroids and stars. Exclusion of the stars and asteroids does not invalidate astrology. The principle behind creating a birth chart is that a person is said to possess qualities according to the time he/she is born. It is our astrological portrait that tells us of our highest potentials and symbolically represents our psyche. 
The Elements The entire universe constitutes of 4 elements, namely fire, water, air and earth. These elements represent certain traits and when applied to personalities, give them a certain “temperament”. This temperament is variable as it depends upon the emphasis or non emphasis of elements in our horoscope. People who have a strong emphasis of fire element are impulsive and spontaneous. Their emotional response is fast and they exercise their energies wholeheartedly and have quite a lively imagination. Zodiac signs that fall under this element are Aries, Sagittarius and Leo. People who fall under the Air element are animated and quick. Their energies are applied in diverse ways. They have a tendency to intellectualize their expectations and feelings. Aquarius, Libra and Gemini zodiacs fall under this element. People who have a strong emphasis of Water element are very sensitive and are the ‘feeling’ type. They have rich and deep emotional and imaginative lives. Cancer, Pisces and Scorpio have a strong emphasis of Water element. People who have a strong emphasis of Earth element react slowly and quietly. They have great level of endurance. They are deeply rooted emotionally and hence change very slowly. Zodiac signs Taurus, Capricorn and Virgo have strong Earth emphasis. 

The four elements have three states or qualities each called the fixed, the mutable and the cardinal states. For an analogy, water in it liquid form will be in its cardinal state, in ice form will be in its fixed state and in its vapor form will be in mutable state. Aries, Libra, Capricorn and Cancer come under Cardinal signs. They are initiators as they have an urge to shape up things. Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius and Taurus come under fixed signs. They build on what is already there and make it more organized. Sagittarius, Pieces, Virgo and Gemini are Mutable signs. They change things and their actions change with the unfolding process 
The Zodiacs There are 12 sun signs and each belongs to an element in one of its forms. Thus emerges the figure of ‘12’ signs. There can not be a pure Scorpio or a pure Libra as each person has a horoscope with different positions of the heavenly bodies. Each horoscope is very unique and complex. To understand each sign properly we also need to take an account of its elemental qualities and also the characteristics of the planets to which each one of them belongs. 

Aries is a cardinal Fire sign that is ruled by Mars. Taurus is a fixed Earth sign that is ruled by Venus. Gemini is a mutable Air sign ruled by Mercury. Cancer is a cardinal Water sign ruled by Moon. Leo is a fixed Fire sign ruled by the Sun. Virgo is a Mutable Earth sign ruled by Mercury. Libra is a cardinal Air sign ruled by Venus. Scorpio is a fixed Water sign ruled by Pluto. Sagittarius is a mutable Fire sign ruled by Jupiter. Capricorn is a cardinal Earth sign ruled by Saturn. Aquarius is a fixed Air sign ruled by Uranus. Pisces is a mutable Water sign ruled by Neptune. 
The Houses The horoscope is divided in to a number of houses, usually 12. The position of these houses depends on location and time of birth more, rather than the date of birth. They represent the different spheres of life. These spheres can be described in terms of personal experiences in life as well as physical surroundings. In the chart, the position of a zodiac sign or planet in a house determines to a large extent how a personal planet will act in an area or phase of life, and also the activities on which its force needs to be exerted.",
Stamp Collecting,"Stamp Collecting Information INTRODUCTIONBy the looks of it, I know it sounds pretty boring even for a hobby. So not all enjoy this form of hobby you know. Then why am I even writing about this hobby, is it some kind of a diabolical scheme, something intriguing so that you get hooked on to this hobby? Nope, nothing of that sort. Oh sure, stamp collecting has surely be termed as the world’s greatest hobby, but what exactly has made it all that to be the pinnacle of all hobbies? Stamp collecting, more than a hobby, is a craze among enthusiasts to collect since it gives them a feeling that they have a piece of history, a piece of art in their stamp collection books. How many times has it happened that when you open your mailbox, you come across a rather interesting postage stamp and you keep telling yourself that hey, I can start collecting these little things. Well, FYI, stamp collecting is a rather interesting hobby and lets face it, when you walk into a museum and you come across a rather old stamp collection, you always get the feeling that that you could start off with something like this too and why not right, I mean, how difficult can it really get?If these are the thoughts that have been hovering in and around your head, I’m pleased to formally greet you by saying, “Welcome to the world of stamp collecting…” Careful as we are in picking our words, this hobby is one of the few that are spread the world over. One of the best things about this hobby is that since people from every background are engaged in this hobby, the stamps collected by them will also differ for the simple reason that they might rather find some peculiar property of certain stamps a bit more interesting than others, which makes this hobby a bit unique. That’s because it is assured that the stamp collectors won’t be having the same collections throughout and they are bound to differ. Besides, compared to other hobbies, it doesn’t take an Einstein to figure out that collecting stamps is an inexpensive hobby. I mean c’mon, what would you rather go for, collecting model airplanes and cars or simply collecting some stamps? Stamp collecting is quite an ancient hobby with the first stamp, i.e., Penny Black, being showcased to the entire world in the 1840s and soon, after a decade or two, children all over England became engrossed in the entire concept of collecting stamps.This stamp collecting rage was even continued when children grew up to be adults thereby making stamp collecting a hobby not just for children, but even for the adults. And this has well gone throughout the 21st century even where stamp collecting has got its rightful place as perhaps the world’s greatest hobby. Take this for statistics, more than 19 million Americans are engaged in the hobby of stamp collecting and that’s only America we’re talking about, if you take the statistics of each of the countries, boy, are you going to be surprised or what!!! Timbromania (stamp madness) has affected the world indeed and people are getting infatuated by this hobby every second, even as we talk about it, may be 2-3 kids have already started filling up their stamp collection books. People would perhaps do anything to get their hands on those stamps that have a possible defect on them, the most famous stamp in this respect being the Inverted Jenny. Nobody could understand how such a defect could take place in printing out a stamp which in this case was simply a picture of a plane was mistakenly printed upside down. Stamp collectors did everything they could imagine to catch a glimpse of that specific stamp which only adds to the whole craze of stamp collecting.his takes us to the profitable aspect of stamp collecting. Just as you may have seen rare items being sold for a good sum of money, rare stamps too can be sold for quite a profit. Lets take the earlier example of the Inverted Jenny for this one too, shall we? Only about a 100 stamps of the Inverted Jenny were released in public and you’d be quite surprised at the fact that simply a block of four stamps were auctioned out for a staggering $2.7 million. Stamp collecting is one hobby that if it could speak for itself, would pass out a comment like “How do you like them apples???” to any other hobby in the world. Chasing a rare/misprinted stamp is something that really serious stamp collectors indulge in. Selling/auctioning off rare stamps could make you, as a stamp collector pretty rich and if you get to make some big bucks simply by pursuing a hobby, well, what more could you possibly ask for?Well, that’s that for stamp collecting. Lets move on to something that was not discussed even in the earlier article. Yes, we are referring to “philately”. Philately is nothing but a careful observation or a study of postal as well as revenue stamps. You should remember that this is not the same as stamp collecting since avid philately enthusiasts will simply study the rare and exquisite nature of the stamps without even expecting to own them some day. This simply points out to the fact that not all philately enthusiasts are stamp collectors. Philately came into existence when people starting observing fine details of stamps like for example, all the same stamps were not printed on the same kind of paper. Differences like variations in the watermarks, colors used, etc. made this hobby quite an intelligent one helping people to develop an eye for details. For a collector, a stamp may as well be just a collector’s item, but for a philatelist, it’s more of the study that captures his interest.So many years have passed and people over the years always said that stamp collecting and philately will eventually just fade out as kids become acquainted with other forms of recreational activities. People who said that surely must be twitching and getting spasms in their graves because boy, were they wrong!!! Stamp collecting and philately can be quite a fun activity for people of all ages. And it’s pretty safe to say that this hobby is going quite steady, even in the 21st century, so why not, why not take up this hobby and find out more about those little bits of paper that we call “stamps”. It even educates you about the cultural and geographical features of countries all over and the more you find out about it, the more enticing it will become and besides, isn’t this what hobbies are all about?Collecting stamps is not only fun, but also increases your knowledge on history and geography even without you realizing it. By looking at a stamp you can understand the year of its existence and the country in which it was printed. Collecting stamps is also a good way of making new friends and for parents it’s a great way of their children getting together without creating a ruckus. Collecting stamps can give you immense pleasure and every stamp collected creates an urge to collect more and it is this thrill of not knowing which stamp might turn up, which makes stamp collecting an interesting hobby. Many children carry over this childhood hobby well into the rest of their lives because it is a hobby without any limitations or boundaries.WHY STAMPS?Collecting stamps is a better hobby than many other hobbies because first and foremost it occupies very little space. The money required to start this hobby is very less as compared to collecting ‘dinky’ cars or toy planes. This hobby is safer and less hair-raising than collecting bugs or butterflies. All you need is to purchase a stamp collection book and a pair of special stamp holding tweezers to handle your stamps. You can immediately start collecting stamps by removing the stamps from your mail. These can be steamed off the envelope so that they come out without any damage. These stamps can then be inserted in your stamp collection book in the slots provided or you can use hinges, which are basically small pieces of folded paper with a weak gum on both sides. This weak gum ensures that you do not damage the stamp while removing it. Collecting stamps is a hobby without any limits or borders as there are thousands and thousands of stamps being circulated throughout the world. So the chances of you getting bored are negligible. Do not throw away any duplicate stamps, which you might have received. You can use them in exchange for another stamp of your choice. The infinite range of stamps covers famous personalities, cars, planes, historical events, animals, birds, etc. The list is endless and this is what could make you into an avid stamp collector or philatelist.WHERE CAN STAMPS BE PROCURRED?Along with removing them from your mail, you can also purchase stamps from various dealers and associations. You can find out a lot about stamps by buying catalogues from ‘The Scotts Collection’, where all the stamps are classified and numbered and this method has been adopted by many dealers and stamp collectors to arrange their stamp collection. You too can check out the catalogues.I HAVE STARTED MY COLLECTION. NOW WHAT?Once you have your own collection of stamps and if your friends too have started collecting them, then you can sit together and check out each other’s collections. You will be surprised at the vast range of stamps, which have been issued around the world. You will also learn some things like “Noyta CCCP” means that the stamp was issued in Russia. This is a fun way to spend time with your friends and even make some new ones. You can then start ‘bartering’ your stamps with your friends. This means that you can exchange your stamp for another one, which you do not have. This will take care of any duplicate stamps, which you might have collected by mistake. Slowly, as you will begin realizing the monetary value of your stamps, you will be able to identify those stamps that have a high value and those which are rare. You can exchange these stamps by offering 2 or 3 less rare stamps in return. You can also start subscribing to various stamp collecting magazines, like the Global Stamp News or the Scott Monthly Journal, which will give you information about rare stamps and also about people who want to trade, or buy or sell stamps. Many people have, in this way turned their hobby into a full-time profession.Proper storage of your stamps is also very important. Your stamps should be in a good condition. The perforations should be as perfect as possible and hence when removing it from an envelope, do not try to pull it off by using force. Once you have applied enough steam, you can easily pick it off the envelope with your tweezers without any effort. Store them in your stamp collection book by sticking them onto the hinges provided or by slotting them in their positions. It is also very important to learn to identify fake stamps, which could otherwise spoil your collection and your mood. Show any suspicious stamps to a reputed dealer to get an idea about its authenticity. The value of a stamp is determined by its rarity, its condition and the year of issue. By subscribing to magazines, you will also come to know about any stamp shows in your area. You can attend these shows to check out the vast range of stamps on display and sale. You can also meet like-minded people in these shows thereby expanding your range of knowledge in this field.So, you too can start collecting stamps by following the guidelines given above. Start slowly and soon you will be able to build up your collection and knowledge along the way. You will be able to meet new people with similar tastes and will be able to spend hours checking out and discussing each other’s collections. As your collection grows in size, you might slowly be able to attach a monetary value to your collection. You could realize that what once started out as just a new hobby has turned into something of great value, historically and financially. Go ahead, start your stamp collection now.",
Magic Tricks,"Magic Tricks Information  Introduction The first thing that we think of when we hear the word magic is simply “Abra Cadabra” and “Shazaam” which is good by the way. I’m sure many of you guys might have considered performing a trick or two to impress your friends or something like that. But hey, aren’t you supposed to know how to perform a bit of magic trick for that? So if you’re all pumped up to learn how to perform a magic trick, you can take it up as a hobby you know. Besides, it’s not like everyone who knows magic HAS to run and join the circus. So yeah, taking up as magic as a hobby could be quite worth your time, when you’re not doing anything important that is. Lets face it, you’ll be a hit at the parties when you show off some of your skills. And all that depends how passionate you are about pursuing this hobby. You should not have any difficulty in choosing the right kind of trick to learn because quite frankly, there are millions of tricks out there you can choose from. Besides, all you need is some props with you and voila, you’re all set up as the great Houdini himself.   
Why Learn This might as well be the best hobby out there for your kids for the simple reason that they are easy to learn and the word “tricks” is like the magic word that will keep your kids and even adults glued to this marvelous hobby. Lets admit it, unlike other hobbies that need the person to be careful and also a lot of practice, magic isn’t the same now is it? It hardly requires any practice or any preparation of any sort. Now when we talk about magic, the first thing that you have to understand is that this ain’t the real magic like the one you must have heard in fables. Lets leave the magic of Merlin aside for this time and make it clear that what we are talking about is nothing but simple illusions, simple tricks, that is all. No black magic involved in this hobby, although you might want to make your audience believe that the “truth is out there”. So what are the different kinds of magic out there that you can specialize in? Lets see, there are the three Ps, i.e., Production, Penetration and Prediction. The 2 Ts, Transformation and Teleportation and of course, Vanishing, Restoration and the “Oh so Famous”, Levitation. 

Let us see what each of these categories have to offer us shall we? In case of the Production tricks, all the magician has to do is produce something out of nowhere. This is a trick that is quite contrary to the Vanishing act. A well-known example would include pulling a bunny out of your hat, removing a dime from any of the participant’s ear, etc. This trick is surely made to stir some eyes in surprise. In case of the Vanishing act, all the magician has to do is take something and poof!!! Simply make it disappear right from underneath the participant’s nose without them even being aware of this. This is a trick that is totally the opposite of the Production trick. One famous trick would include presenting an empty box to your participants and then at the snap of your fingers, revealing that your assistant was in there all along. Then of course there is the trick so that you get to experience the “awe” of little children, making a dove disappear from under a cloth. 
Different Tricks How can we even forget the Transformation act that we are so much intrigued by on so many occasions? In this trick, the magician has to change something into something totally different, like changing an object from one part to another. This is nothing but a combination of the Vanishing and the Production acts. Changing a color of your hanker chief is a well known trick in this respect. Another trick to add on to the mystery of your performance would include letting a participant choose a card from an entire deck which is totally undisclosed to you and then later presenting the same card that the participant had chosen in the first place. Oh yeah, that’s just a bit freaky but hey, that’s exactly the stuff that magic is all made of. Then comes the Restoration trick in which the magician asks for the participation of the audience. He may call one participant to the stage and may be destroy his watch or something like that only to reveal that object in its undamaged form quite to the surprise of the participant and to the cheers of the audience. You can also tear a piece of paper into 4-5 pieces and reveal it in its original form to your audience. And, then there is the one that is Oh so popular. By sewing the box with your assistant in it and reattaching the box only to reveal your assistant pop out of the box like nothing ever even happened. 

The Levitation trick is one trick that involves a lot of trickery on your part so that your audience never sees through it. This is nothing but creating an illusion so that the object or even yourself appear to be floating in mid air. One famous act that quite a few must have witnessed on television must be the one in which world renowned magicians David Blaine and Criss Angel hovered in mid air for several seconds quite to the astonishment of the onlookers. One thing that you have to remember is that they are street magicians and are very good at creating illusions. This means that it requires a lot of practice, unlike other tricks that you usually tend to come across like the common card and coin tricks. Floating a metal object in between your hands is perhaps the easiest of all the levitation tricks out there. The Penetration trick is one admired and performed by many magicians. This would involve a magician taking something like a sword and passing it through a box with his assistant in it with the assistant walking away from the act practically untouched. 

So there, the different kinds of magic that you can all be interested in, what more of a hobby would you like? Who wouldn’t want to see the audience being captivated by the mysterious tricks of the magician and leave them asking for more? If you’re all set on doing that, then magic tricks is the perfect hobby for you.",
Scuba Diving,"Scuba Diving Information  Introduction The world under the sea is a vast expanse of unknown and often uncharted territories. It offers the adventurous spirit wonder, awe, and even inspiration. Thanks to Jacques Cousteau, one of the ocean’s most influential explorers, the average person, from business executive to housewife, has the opportunity to dive deep into the great blue sea and witness all that it has to offer. 

When taking the first tentative steps into the world of scuba diving, it can be somewhat nervous, stepping into the unknown and worrying about the things that could go wrong. Just about the only thing people see or hear in the news about scuba diving is when something goes wrong. The millions of dives every year that work out perfectly are testament enough to the fact that the sport, or recreation, has come a long way in terms of safety during the past several decades. 

The earliest stages of learning to scuba dive will bring some apprehension. We, as a human species, are not intended to breathe underwater, so for some people, getting used to the apparatus and the entire concept of breathing underwater may take a bit of getting used to. A quality scuba school will take you through the steps one at a time, and will allow you to test your mettle in a pool onsite rather than the open ocean waters. 

A scuba diving certification is mandatory in most regions around the world in order to rent equipment, partake in dive tours, and even to have the air in the cylinders recharged and reloaded. 

Where one chooses to earn their scuba diving certification is actually quite important as not all dive shops around the world recognize specific credentials. SSI (Scuba Schools International), for example, is the one universally recognized certification that will pretty much ensure that wherever you go, you will be recognized as a properly trained scuba diver. Of course, this isn’t an endorsement of one school over another, but several divers have learned the hard way that certain dive shops and locations don’t recognize other certifications. 

A dive certification is valid for the individual’s entire lifetime, meaning there is no need, once the tests are passed and the certification earned, to have to ever test again. However, scuba diving is one of those recreations that could use a little refreshment from time to time. 

Once a person dives down into the wonder that awaits beneath the waves, they never want to stop. 
History Scuba is an acronym for ‘Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus’, which was coined by its creater, Jacques Cousteau. It is a form of underwater diving where a person is able to breathe through the use of special equipment, gases, and training. Scuba diving is commonly used for recreation, but it is also used in commercial, industrial, and rescue operations as well. 

The earliest forms of diving deep underwater required the use of air to be pumped down through tubes from the surface to the divers. Scuba divers carry their own supply of air, which is a combination of nitrogen and oxygen in a compressed gas form. This allows the divers to have greater flexibility and mobility to dive deeper and to move around wherever they feel is the best location. Scuba diving allows a person to submerge for far longer periods of time, and to go deeper than snorkeling or free-diving. 

Most scuba divers use swim fins to propel through the water, but current technology enables them to use the assistance of propulsion devices to carry them through the water. 

The first commercially successful scuba sets were the Aqualung open-circuit units developed by Emile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau, in which compressed gas (usually air) is inhaled from a tank and then exhaled into the water, and the descendants of these systems are still the most popular units today. 

The open circuit systems were developed after Cousteau had a number of incidents of oxygen toxicity using a rebreather system, in which exhaled air is reprocessed to remove carbon dioxide. Modern versions of rebreather systems (both semi-closed circuit and closed circuit) are still available today, and form the second main type of scuba unit, most commonly used for technical diving, such as deep diving. 
Controlling Buoyancy Underwater Buoyancy is what is referred to as a person’s (or object’s) ability to float in a given surface. The deeper a person dives, the heavier they appear to be. This isn’t caused by any pressure from the water pushing down, but rather the compression of the air in the lungs, and what is known as the B.C. vest (buoyancy control vest). When air is compressed, more is required to maintain a level flotation. 

To dive safely, divers must control their rate of descent and ascent in the water. Ignoring other forces such as water currents and swimming, the diver`s overall buoyancy determines whether he ascends or descends. Equipment such as the diving weighting systems, diving suits (wet, dry or semi-dry suits are used depending on the water temperature) and buoyancy compensators can be used to adjust the overall buoyancy. When divers want to remain at constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy. This minimizes gas consumption caused by swimming to maintain depth. 

The downward force on the diver is the weight of the diver and his equipment minus the weight of the same volume of the liquid that he is displacing; if the result is negative, that force is upwards. The buoyancy of any object immersed in water is also affected by the density of the water. The density of fresh water is about 3% less than that of ocean water. Therefore, divers who are neutrally buoyant at one dive destination (e.g. a fresh water lake) will predictably be positively or negatively buoyant at destinations with different water densities (e.g. a tropical coral reef). 

Diving weighting systems can be used to reduce the diver`s weight and cause an ascent in an emergency. Diving suits, mostly being made of compressible materials, shrink as the diver descends, and expand as the diver ascends, creating buoyancy changes. Diving in different environments also necessitates adjustments in the amount of weight carried to achieve neutral buoyancy. The diver can inject air into some diving suits to counteract the compression effect and squeeze. Buoyancy compensators allow easy and fine adjustments in the diver`s overall volume and therefore buoyancy. For open circuit divers, changes in the diver`s lung volume can be used to adjust buoyancy. 
Equipment Needed for Scuba Diving Scuba diving is considered a more exclusive recreation because of the expense for the equipment as well as the maintenance. Having quality equipment is one of the most important factors when it comes to purchasing equipment. The cheaper the items, the more at risk one places himself or herself when diving, especially when diving to deeper depths. 

Most dive shops around the world have rental equipment available, but a person must be able to show their scuba certification and it must be from a dive school or organization that they recognize, or they will not rent the equipment or permit the individual to attend a particular dive. 

Also, depending on where a person plans to dive will determine whether they will need other peripheral equipment. The most common is a wet suit, which is used when diving into cold waters, such as the ocean waters off of the coast of California. A wet suit means that the person will be wet, but the body will warm the water against the skin, allowing the person to avoid the risks of hypothermia. Dry suits are sealed suits in which the individual will remain dry and can wear normal clothing if preferred, while diving. Dry suits are ideal when water temperatures on the surface are considered too cold for wet suits, usually below 55 degrees Fahrenheit.  
Basic equipment The most basic equipment needed for scuba diving, which every person should have of their own, is the face mask, or dive mask. A dive mask should be fitted to the individual. Many modern dive masks can also accommodate vision maladies, such as far sightedness. When a person has their own dive mask, they are assured that it will fit snuggly, not tight, and create a perfect seal around their face. Dive masks cover the eyes and the nose. 

A snorkel is the second piece of basic equipment. Snorkels are used when the diver is on the surface. To save air in the tank, a diver will revert to the snorkel. 

Swim fins are ideal for propulsion through the water and there are many different kinds of swim fins, each serving a different purpose. A dive shop professional will be able to instruct on the benefits and hindrances of one swim fin over another. 

Wherever a wet suit will be necessary, swim gloves, boots, and hood will also be essential. These are made of the same material as wet suits and provide the same protection against the cold. 

Beyond the most basic equipment that every scuba diver should own, comes the rest of the equipment that can be rented from dive shops, but is beneficial to own for oneself. The BC (Buoyancy Control) vest is a vest that the diver wears over the shoulders, like a backpack. To this, the tank is secured, the backup regulator is attached, and the weights as well. 

Regulators. There are many kinds of regulators that can be used by divers, but the most important thing to consider is safety. A quality regulator is ideal, especially when planning dives to one hundred feet or more. Having a regulator and buoyancy control vest with a backup regulator is essential, and often required by many dive shops. The reason to have a backup regulator is in case something goes wrong with the primary regulator, or a dive companion has an issue with their equipment while on a dive. 

Weights are essential in order to submerge to certain depths. Having too much weight can pose buoyancy problems and could drag a diver down too fast. Having too little weight will mean that a diver may not be able to submerge at all. 
How to Start the Scuba Diving Experience Scuba shops are in abundance throughout the world, even in remote, dry land regions. Lakes and some slow moving rivers offer a wonder by themselves and scuba divers enjoy keeping up with their hobby, sport, or recreation, depending on whom one discusses it with. The most basic training for scuba diving will require class work, a short test, and then dry surface or pool exercises. 

The most important factor to consider when beginning to learn to scuba dive, as mentioned earlier, is to choose a school that has the proper credentials, with an instructor who has at least several hundred dives under his or her belt. The wrong school or the wrong teacher could mean that when you take your next vacation to an exotic location with blue waters and tropical fish, you may find that you are unable to dive because of the certification you possess. 

The safest and most widely recognizable organization for scuba certification around the world is known as SSI (Scuba Schools International). The requirements that SSI set for earning a scuba certification are strict and enforced, which means that just about every dive shop throughout the world will recognize a scuba diver with a SSI certification. 

The idea of submerging oneself under one hundred feet of ocean water can be somewhat nerve-racking. If you have any reservations about whether or not you will suffer from claustrophobic symptoms while trying to learn to breathe underwater, it’s important to mention this to the dive shop and instructor before signing up for the course. 

Most courses that are worthwhile charge around $300 US and up for complete certification. Several dive shops offer a sample day, where the person can suit up, have the mask in place, and then submerge in a pool or other shallow body of water to determine if scuba diving will even be a possibility for them before spending the money for the course. Most schools do not have a refund policy for the certification course. 
The Process Scuba diving is a process of learning. The first step is to learn the safety measures, how the body reacts to pressure changes, and what to do in certain emergency situations. From there, the student will learn about the equipment, checking to ensure that it is safe, and how often it should be checked by a professional. 

Once the class work is completed, then the shallow dives begin. Most schools perform this in a pool, in a controlled environment. The student is required to gather their equipment, properly assemble it, attach it to their body, and then enter the water through the appropriate methods. 

Once this test is passed, then there are a couple of open water dives. When out in the open water, more tests are performed, such as removing the mask underwater and reattaching it and blowing the water out, as well as removing the regulator from the mouth, replacing it, and beginning to breathe again. 

When the student displays adept skills at these tasks, then the actual dives begin. 
Frequently Asked Questions Is it safe? 

With any activity, there are risks involved. In scuba diving, the risks are mostly dependent on the individual. If the individual takes proper precautions, maintains their equipment well, and always dives with at least one partner, then the risks are minimal. Decompression sickness is one of the most common situations that occur that can pose a serious risk to one’s health. This is when a person surfaces too quickly and the gases that form in the blood at deep depths doesn’t have a chance to escape. 

Proper courses go through these conditions, and how to avoid them, in great detail. Taking the activity seriously will lead to low risk. 

I’m afraid of tight quarters, can I dive? 

Ask your local dive shop professional if you can test out in a pool the equipment. Give it a few tries and if you can’t get over your fear, then perhaps scuba diving is not right for you. 

I found a great deal on equipment in the newspaper. Should I grab it? 

Diving is a risk. Having the right equipment shouldn’t be a matter of saving a few dollars. If you know the brands and the equipment appears in good shape, ask the seller if you can have an experienced dive professional look it over first. If they agree, then do so. If they don’t, then stay away. 
Conclusion The water holds secrets that mankind hasn’t even imagined yet, let alone actually witnessed. Scuba diving allows anyone the opportunity to swim to the edge of those secrets and see the wonders of what lies beyond our landlocked sight and vision. Scuba diving and the equipment that is used has evolved in leaps and bounds through the years and is safer than ever. 

With thousands of dive shops around the world, there is rarely a location that can’t be accessed to dive and become a part of the living sea below. The rule should always be, however, that safety comes first. When it does, then every dive will be a successful dive.",
Jiu Jitsu,"Jiu Jitsu Information  Introduction Jiu Jitsu, also known as Ju Jitsu and Jujutsu, is a Japanese martial arts system that utilizes a wide range of techniques including kicks, strikes, throws, joint locks and chocking as well as the use of weapon. Aspects of Jiu Jitsu can be found in almost all forms of martial arts. 

The word is usually translated as Ju meaning gentle or yielding and Jitsu meaning technique or art. The basic principles involve using the attacker’s own energy against himself rather than attacking back with your own energy. 

Jiu Jitsu does not have a clear lineage because it was developed by several different schools across many centuries. Thus, the techniques of Jiu Jitsu vary depending upon the school. There are both traditional and modern forms of Jiu Jitsu sport. Additionally, the arm lock and submission techniques have become popular with Police across the globe. 
Techniques There many different Jiu Jitsu techniques and each school has their own style of execution. The below are some of the major techniques: 

Kansetsu Waza - Joint Locks 

Joint locks or arm locks serve many functions. Some control the opponent’s weapon while others inflict pain by bending the joint the wrong way, which usually forces submission. Other techniques set up for throwing techniques or simply to restrain the aggressor. These techniques are for controlling an opponent’s attack and can be used on any point that bends including fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders and knees. Joint locks are often used by police forces to control criminals and in interrogation or torture. Joint lock submissions are often the final move in modern sports contests. 

Shime Waza – Chokeholds 

One of the most dangerous of Jiu Jitsu techniques, a chokehold can bring about unconsciousness or even death. If the windpipe is damaged by choking the neck, death can be brought about by asphyxiation. Otherwise, an opponent can be knocked unconscious for three to seven second by strangling, which cuts off the blood flow to the brain. Death by strangulation would take over a minute, which is why strangulation techniques are still allowed while choking techniques are normally banned. Strangulation techniques can be more easily applied to restrain without any fatal consequences whereas choking is much more difficult to perform without permanent damage to the opponent. Additionally, Jiu Jitsu has many techniques to counter choking or strangling techniques, which makes it a very popular form of self-defense. 

Atemi (Kyusho) - Striking Arts (Vital Points) 

While most schools of Jiu Jitsu don’t put an emphasis on striking an opponent, strike techniques are used as tools for disabling opponents. It usually involves striking key points on an opponent’s body that are sensitive, causing pain or injury. The body or weapons can be utilized to hit or press vital spots such as nerve centers, weak bone structures, and exposed organs. However, most Jiu Jitsu schools do not allow kicks above the shoulders. Karate was developed by students of Jiu Jitsu who favored striking techniques 

Ne Waza - Ground Fighting/Grappling 

Similar to Joint Locks, grappling pins and holds are used when an opponent is on the ground. Early systems of grappling were generally simple moves including some very damaging techniques such as gouging or biting. For sporting contests, more elaborate techniques were developed. Over time, grappling moves were altered so that they could be practiced by anyone for a variety of purposes including physical health, sports contests and self-defense. Thus, for modern competitions, some of the ancient techniques are banned and very few schools still teach the old moves. 

Nage Waza - Throwing Arts 

Throwing techniques is one of the prime examples of using an opponent’s force against himself. By creating an imbalance in the attacking person, it is easy and swift to throw them, usually forcing them to become prone on the ground. This can lead to grappling techniques, but often victory was won through the use of knives or other small weapons. Throwing techniques were used most when unarmed and fighting against an armed opponent to get them in position to disarm them. 

Orosu – Takedowns 

Not to be confused with throws, takedown use physical strength to drag or strike the opponent to the floor. This utilizes brute strength to overcome the opponent while throws use the opponent against himself. A takedown usually occurs once the opponent’s legs or arms are trapped, which prevent retreated. In modern sporting contests, takedowns are usually accidental or because of an over-aggressive attack. 
Schools and derivatives Many styles and derivatives exist today because there are so many different facets of Jiu Jitsu. As techniques were modified and new moves were incorporated, many instructors codified their style and created their own school, or ryu. As other learned these new schools they, in turn, would continue to develop and change the styles into their own. Some schools were so altered from the original that they are no longer considered Jiu Jitsu.  
Old Schools In the 1600s there were well over 2000 Japanese Jiu Jitsu ryu with characteristics that were common to most of them. However, specific technical characteristics vary from school to school. Some schools of Jiu Jitsu do not conform to the generalizations about Jiu Jitsu. Some of the old Japanese schools include: 

- Araki-ryu was founded by Araki Mujinsai Minamoto no Hidenawa in the early 1570s and specializes in close combat grappling with weapons. Before beginning the study of Araki-ryu, students and practitioners must take a set of vows called the Kishmon Mae Gaki no Koto. 

- Daito-ryu aiki-Jiu Jitsu was first popularized under the leadership of Takeda Sokaku in the early 20th century and it emphasizes neutralizing an attack early. Though the school claims to have roots that extend centuries into Japanese history, there are no known records before Takeda Sokaku began practicing and teaching. Interestingly, the founder of Aikido, Morihei Ueshiba, was one of Takeda’s students. 

- Hontai Yoshin-ryu was founded by Takagi Shigetoshi around the 1660s and it focuses on unarmed grappling combat as well as some weapons arts. There are very few schools today because they value their traditions and do not believe in commercialism. 

- Kashima Shin-ryū was found in 1450 is known as one of the Japanese koryu martial arts and primarily teaches weapon arts. Koryu means old school and usually applied to Japanese schools of martial arts that began before the Meiji Restoration. 

- Kukishin-ryū was founded by Kuki Yakushimaru Ryūshin in the 14th century and teaches a variety of weapons arts. The name originally meant Nine Gods Spirit School, but due to the simplification of Japanese kanji the current versions can be translated as Nine Demon Gods School. 

- Kyushin Ryu was founded by Inugami Sakon-no-shokan Nagakatsu around 1558. Originally, it focused on teaching striking techniques, but over time, various masters added techniques such as throwing, grappling and Katsu Waza, which were methods of resuscitation and first aid. 

- Sekiguchi Shinshin-ryu was founded by Sekiguchi Yarokuemon Ujimune in the 1640s and is most well-known for its grappling and sword techniques. While the school spread wide across the country and was practiced for many centuries, during World War II, most of the school’s documents were lost. It took more than fifteen years to restore the school and continue its teachings. 

- Sosuishitsu-ryu was founded by Futagami Hannosuke Masaaki around 1650 and teaches unarmed and armed grappling as well as sword techniques. Over the years, this school has almost been completely abandoned several times, but those who carried it on decided to incorporate other techniques, making it more fluid and relevant. This continual evolution continues to this day. 

- Takenouchi-ryu was founded by Takenouchi Chūnagon Daijō Nakatsukasadaiyū Hisamori in 1532 and is one of the oldest Japanese koryu. Though it is famous for it Jiu Jitsu techniques which have influenced the founding of many other schools, Takenouchi-ryu teaches many other forms of martial arts including armed grappling (yoroi kumiuchi), staff (bōjutsu), sword (kenjutsu), sword drawing (iaijutsu), glaive (naginatajutsu), iron fan (tessenjutsu), restraining rope (hojōjutsu), and resuscitation techniques (sakkatsuhō). 

- Tatsumi-ryu was founded by Tatsumi Sankyo sometime between 1504 and 1521 and covers a lot of of the classical martial and strategic skill with the main focus on the katana, the Japanese backsword. While weapon arts dominate the curriculum, a large portion of the teachings are on unarmed grappling, resuscitation and restraining techniques. 

- Tenjin Shinyo-ryu was founded by Iso Mataemon Minamoto no Masatari in the 1830s and its special techniques focus on striking to disrupt balance as well as fluid and flexible movements of the body. Tenjin Shinyo-ryu is translated as Divine True Willow School and is classified as a Japanese koryu.   - Yagyu Shingan Ryu is credited to be founded by Ushū Tatewaki sometimes in the 1600s. Originally created to be a battlefield art, the techniques focus on weapons and grappling used against armored and unarmored opponents. 

- Yoshin Ryu was founded by Akiyama Shirōbei Yoshitoki in 1632 and focuses completely on traditional Jiu Jitsu grappling techniques. It is is one of the most popular and well-known having spread all across Japan by the 1860s and to Europe and North America by 1912. 
What you need & How to get started To get into Jiu Jitsu, you’ll need to research a local club or dojo. Most places offer a free first lesson or sit-in so you can see whether it’s something you want to pursue. At first, you will not need to buy the uniform, which is called Gi. Typically, they want you to come dressed in a loose t-shirt and track pants or shorts. Once you’ve decided that Jiu Jitsu is for you, you can purchase a Gi, although some clubs include them in the price of the lessons. 

There is some other equipment you might want to get. Sparring gloves and feet protectors are good for more advanced training. These range from simple foam protectors to fingerless sparring gloves to professional boxing gloves. Since some clubs provide weapon training, you may want to buy your own. Take care when travelling with weapons as different places have different rules on transporting dangerous weapons. For gloves, feet protectors and weapons, most clubs will provide these without any cost to you, but you can also buy your own if you want so that you can practice at home. 
Conclusion Today, Jiu Jitsu is done for several reasons. Some learn it to defend themselves since most of the techniques do not require strength and there are many techniques to use against grabs. Others practice it for health reasons because the moves will help build stamina and flexibility and do not require a high level off fitness to begin with. Many find self confidence through their studies and practice. There are many other reasons, but not matter what your reason is for learning, there will be a place for you to learn. 

Below is some history on the sport if you are interested.",
Reptiles,"Reptiles Information  Introduction Throughout North America, it has become quite common to find people that keep different reptile species as pets. It wasn’t that long ago that reptiles were so rare in the community that to purchase one from a pet store cost you an arm and a leg and the chances of it being wild caught was quite good, but the hobby has grown so immensely over the past few decades that people of all ages and sexes are now keeping these wonderful animals as pets. Although reptiles for the most part has not received the same negative stigma as snakes, the biggest question that is asked to people that keep reptiles as pets is “why?”. Of course the purpose of this article is to answer that very question, but the short and painless answer, or Coles notes version, is that there is such a huge diversity of reptiles now available to the public and on top of being completely unique in the pet industry, they are utterly fascinating. 

But if they are so unique and fascinating, why is it that their popularity is now just becoming mainstream? The answer is that there has always been, and perhaps always will be, an unknown or mysterious stigma associated with reptiles that a majority of people just aren’t interested in anything but the mainstream cats and dogs. But the main reason there is such an influx of reptiles right now is because there are so many breeders producing a variety of reptiles that have never been available without being caught in the wild. And for those who have strong allergies to pets, reptiles are considered hypoallergenic because they have no hair or dander that most people suffer allergic attacks too. The fact is that reptiles make fantastic pets, and once you have one, you will definitely be hooked in the hobby for the rest of your life. 
What is a reptile? Reptiles are animals in the (Linnaean) class Reptilia. They are characterized by breathing air, laying tough-shelled amniotic eggs, and having skin covered in scales and/or scutes. Reptiles are classically viewed as having a ""cold-blooded"" metabolism. They are tetrapods (either having four limbs or being descended from four-limbed ancestors). Modern reptiles inhabit every continent with the exception of Antarctica, and four living orders are currently recognized: 

• Crocodilia (crocodiles, gavials, caimans, and alligators): 23 species • Sphenodontia (tuataras from New Zealand): 2 species • Squamata (lizards, snakes, and worm lizards): approximately 7,900 species • Testudines (turtles and tortoises): approximately 300 species 
Types of Reptiles Of the over eight thousand reptiles in the world, I have found it best to break down the reptiles into three main categories based on their natural habitats and climate. The three types of climates that reptiles are found in are desert, tropical, and subtropical. Perhaps the hardest part about being part of this fascinating hobby is replicating the natural habitats of specific reptiles. Thankfully after decades of research, it is now possible to purchase nearly anything you could think of for nearly all reptile species from your home town pet store. Can’t find what you need at your pet store? Everything else that is too specific, or for things you pet store simply doesn’t carry, a quick search through the internet will get you anything you could think of for your pet. The best part about purchasing from the internet is that it is typically reptile hobbyists that are selling the products so that you can get help from people inside the hobby at any given time. 

Desert reptiles like it as hot as you can make it for them. Since desert reptile species come for one of the toughest environments around, they are typically a lot hardier that other species. One advancement they have gained over thousands of years is thick scaly skin that helps prevent injuries and protects them from their harsh surroundings. One of the most fascinating aspects of desert reptiles is that they have evolved in such a way that they no longer need to drink water. Because water is so scarce in the desert, these reptiles have evolved to absorb water from the items they eat. This also leads into a varied diet of vegetables/fruits as well as a variety of insect/small rodents. The idea of not putting water in with any animal in general is a great cause of debate in most places, but with desert reptile species, the temperature is often so hot that any water will evaporate instantly causing high humidity. Since these species need to stay dry, increased humidity could lead to respiratory problems. Common reptiles in this group would be Bearded Dragons, Uromastyx, and a variety of geckos. 

Tropical reptiles like their enclosures to be toasty warm and nice and as humid as you can make it for them. These are some of the most unusual reptile species around, and this group is perhaps the largest of them all. In the wild, tropical rainforests are the home to crocodiles, amphibians, and lizards like geckos, Chameleons, monitors, and much much more. Unlike the desert reptiles that need no water, these tropical reptiles need as much as they can get. A majority of this group feeds mainly on insects, small rodents, or other lizards, and for those smaller lizards that like the heights, the bright green and blue Day Gecko for example, love the occasional nectar feast. The problem with some species in this group, like geckos primarily, is that their skin has to absorb so much water that the skin becomes paper thin and can tear easily. These lizards are generally for looking at only, not handling. 

The third group of reptiles generally covers the rest of the reptiles, and these are reptiles considered to be Sub-tropical. These are reptiles that require heat similar to Tropical reptiles, due to their cold blooded nature they need the heat to speed up their metabolism, but they do not require the nigh levels of humidity that are needed by Tropical reptiles. In a lot of ways, these reptiles are a combination of desert and tropical reptiles because they are hardy animals that can survive in most areas of the world, but their habitat requires significantly less than a tropical reptile. Examples of reptiles in this category would by Short Horned Lizards, Chuckwallas, a variety of geckos, and frilled lizards. A lot of reptiles that are part of this group are found throughout North America, and if you look hard enough, you may luck out and find some of these fascinating creatures. 

Although I did say there were only three categories, I have to add that there kind of is a fourth in which we can call “Everything Else”. Just like everything, where there are rules, there are exceptions to those rules. The first rule about cold blooded animals is that they require external heat sources for their metabolism to work, but there are reptiles out there that actually have to be kept cool. For reptiles like Crested Geckos, Satanic Leaf geckos, and some pygmy species of Chameleons, their metabolism only requires low amounts of heat that are often considered far too low for other lizards to survive. There are also a large variety of reptiles that are simply fantastic examples of evolution from the Legless lizard, yes, it has a lizard’s head but a snake’s body, to flying lizards, glide like flying squirrel, to the thorny devil, sort of like a bearded dragon crossed with a cactus. Thanks to evolution, these are some of the most fascinating animals in the wild right now. In recent years, scientists have discovered numerous new species, and in time, many more will be found. 
Reptile Defenses Unlike snakes that boast a large number of venomous species, there are actually only two types of reptiles that are actually venomous. And firstly, no, it is not the Komodo Dragon. Sure they are the largest reptiles in the world, aggressive towards humans, and a bite will act as if there is venom present, the truthful answer is that their mouths are full of harmful bacteria that acts like a venom if bitten. The only two reptiles that are venomous are actually cousins; The Gilas Monster and Beaded Lizard. Both have venom that can easily kill a human, but they are excessively violent and act more like a cross between a snake and a monitor lizard. 
Purchasing Your First Reptile The first rule about purchasing your first reptile is to buy a species that is interesting to you. Never be persuaded to purchase a reptile that you don’t want because you are told it is an easier reptile meant for a beginner. If it is a reptile that you don’t really want, then it is a reptile that you will grow tired of in the future. Regardless of what type it is that you want, you have to ensure you do all the research about it prior to purchasing it so that you take proper care of the reptile from day one. There is simply no sense in getting a reptile that will grow to be 12 feet long that requires a room to live in if you are living in an apartment. The idea that a reptile will grow to the size of its enclosure is a myth, and the fact is that if they live in an enclosure too small their growth will be stunted and they will suffer from health issues. 

One of the most debated issues in all of herpetology is whether to purchase from a private breeder or from a pet store. Here is an argument that is based on a few too many bad apples spoiling it for the bunch. Without pet stores, there simply would not be reptiles, snake, and amphibians in captivity as pets because it was various pet stores that sparked the interest in reptiles in the first place. But over the past twenty years, there have been numerous cases of reptiles being sold by people thinking only of profit as their reptiles suffered from neglect. Thankfully, there has been numerous reptile enthusiasts stepping forward to challenge pet stores to live up to the standards that reptile require, and there have also been numerous pet stores in North America that have been promoting proper reptile care. The downside to purchasing from a pet store is that you will be paying higher prices because the pet store purchases from breeders and then mark up the prices to make a profit. Sometimes you will find unique snakes in pet stores, but for the most time, they are usually the run of the mill whereas, if you purchase from a breeder, you may be able to get a more unique morph that most people have never seen before. 

As a general rule of thumb, always try to purchase the healthiest reptile available. This is easily done by purchasing the largest reptile in a group that has bright eyes and is active. Larger animals typically mean that they are being well fed and cared for. If a reptile is skinny and not active, then it is best to leave it be. One of the most common reasons for buying a small sickly animal from either a breeder or pet store is because you want to save it and nurse it back to health. Although noble your intentions might be, a life time of health issues will not make you love your new pet any more, and health issues in reptiles are incredibly difficult to treat especially if it is young and has yet to build up a resistance to illnesses. A healthy animal can live many years, and if you put in the time that is necessary, you will be rewarded in the long run. 
Required Equipment All reptiles regardless of species require three main things to ensure that they not only survive, but thrive in their new home. The first thing that all reptiles require is an enclosure that is big enough for them to easily move about in, but also large enough to mimic a part of their natural ecosystem. If a reptile primarily stays on the ground, or is terrestrial, then it needs a lot of ground space, but if it spends most of its time in trees above the ground in the wild then it should have a tall cage with little ground space. Depending on the type of reptile, there are numerous types of substrate available for your specific pet ranging from different types of sand for desert reptiles to various types wood mulches for subtropical, and even different types of mosses for tropical pets. You just have to remember to always avoid oak and cedar because they have oils that are toxic to most snake species. Most important of all, especially if you want to keep you new reptile in the cage, you have to have a tight fitting lid that they can’t push up or squeeze through. The fact of the matter is, if they can escape, they will, and just because you can’t see them trying, they are trying as hard as they can to escape. 

The second thing to remember about reptiles is that they are cold blooded, so they require an external heat source to keep their bodies warm. A heat range of 75 to 80 Fahrenheit will suffice for a majority of reptiles, but certain desert species will require significantly higher temperatures in the 120’s and there are also some reptiles that require almost no heat whatsoever. This heat can be from an external reptile heat bulb to heat the cage from above, or you can choose to use a heat mat to heat the cage from below. It is also important to heat only one half of the cage give the reptile a chance to regulate its body temperature by being able to move from one side of the cage to another. Most reptiles love a basking spot light that they can lay under for hours on end. Think of it as sun tanning for reptiles, but a perfect example is the Bearded Dragon that loves the heat so much that it will lay under its lamp and keep its mouth open to regulate his own body temperature. 

The last thing you have to remember is that reptiles like to have a safe and secure place to retreat to should they desire. They do this by curling up underneath things that they can push up against and feel safe. The easiest way to do this is to purchase reptile hides from a pet store that look like big hollow rocks that your snake can climb under. These are the easiest to use, most effective, and the safest. Some people choose to use real rocks, which are alright, but you have to ensure they cannot be pushed over because they can and will crush a small snake. And again, snakes like to regulate their temperatures, so it is important to have one hiding spot on the cool side of the cage, and a hiding spot on the hot side of the cage. 
Conclusion Although they are one of the most misunderstood pet on the market today, the reptile is one of the most unusual pets you can purchase on the market today. They are simply unlike any other pet you could ever think of, and there is such a large variety of them, that there is something for everyone. The moment a reptile is in your house, the hobby envelops you in a way you would never expect. Half the battle is recreating a natural habitat for your pet whether it be desert, tropical, or sub-tropical. I can probably state as a fact that all private breeders at one time or another were just like you or me, and picked up their first pet reptile just because of their uniqueness, but the interest quickly turns into a passion. The simple fact that they make fantastic pets for people of all ages and both sexes. Just when you think they have no personality, they will find a way to surprise you and make you rethink the way you look at these animals forever. And there is no time like the present to get into the hobby because due to the large number of breeders throughout North America, the general price of reptiles has gone down significantly over the past twenty years because there is no longer a need to import wild caught animals. Now you can easily find beautiful reptiles of all sorts of colors, patterns, and sizes to suit your personality, and the best part is that a majority of them are captive bred. You just always have to do your research to ensure that you pet is getting the perfect habitat, perfect diet, and perfect lighting/heating.",
Quilting,"Quilting Information  Intro Quilting is a fun hobby that can leave you feeling very satisfied with your efforts. This wonderful hobby does not call for any specific eligibility criteria and can be taken up no matter how old you are. Quilts are often regarded with sentimental value because the person who creates them makes them with great care and love. A lot of attention goes into the choice of color, material and stitch. By taking up quilting as a hobby, you can enjoy the pleasure of gifting it to your loved ones or just make one for yourself. Who knows, as you become proficient at it, it might even become a nice source of income. In many homes, quilts are often cherished because of the memories they carry and are passed on from generation to generation. 

Getting Started With Quilt Making Quilting is a process that gets you fully involved and by combining art and skill, you can create a lovely quilt that you can keep for decades to come. It can seem intimidating to think that making a quilt takes substantial time depending on the type you are planning on making. But you can rest assured that all your effort will be fully worth it when you see the fruit of your labor. 


Quilting is a craft that has been around since ancient times and is said to have begun some time in the 18th century in America. Quilts were described as coverlets that were made of three layers stitched together to make one layer. The person who makes the quilt is called the quilter. Nowadays, quilting is quite popular as many people earn a substantial income from this creative art. While quilts were made for utility in early times, today, they are widely used to bring a decorative touch with the variety of designs and types of quilts. People who enjoy embroidering and needlework also enjoy quilting. 

What You Need – Quilting Tools As with any hobby, quilting can be made even more enjoyable with the right tools. No matter which type of quilt you intend to get started with, you will need basic stuff like needles, pins, hoops, etc. in your kit. There are more accessories that can enhance your quilt-making activity, letting you produce beautiful quilts. As your skill level goes up, you will enjoy using these tools that help you save time. There are even quilting machines you can consider at a later stage once you get the hang of it. 


Here is an overview of the quilting tools you will come across. Getting familiar with these will let you choose the ones you might need when you get more involved with your quilting hobby. 


- You get fabric markers to mark your quilt fabric. Preferably you should choose one that will wash out. 


- Quilting machines suitable for large quilts literally take the weight off your hands since huge quilts can be tough to hold and stitch at the same time. 


- Quilting needles for machines as well as sewing by hand are something you must need to keep a stock of. Since the needle is vital to your sewing machine or manual quilting, you will need to pick the right ones. 


- Thimbles and pins are also essential in quilting. Many people use pincushions and magnetic pin strips to keep needles and pins in place. For hours of stitching it is advisable to use thimbles since these protect your fingers. There are a variety of them available. 


- Frames and hoops are used in quilting and these come with instructions on how to make use of them. These also come in a wide range of options to choose from. 


- Rotary cutters and boards are very helpful with cutting the fabric, which is considered one of the most important steps in quilting. Since different pieces must be aligned just right, tools like these rotary cutters by Fiskars are the tools for this. 


- Templates for quilting are useful in giving your quilt a unique structure. These help you produce that dream quilt that you are keen on. 


The above tool list is not exhaustive and you will probably discover more as you progress with your quilting hobby. Apart from these, you will need to know how to select threads and cottons for your quilt since this can practically determine how well your quilt will turn out. 

Techniques You will also hear about different quilting techniques and will naturally want to experiment. Some of these techniques are: 


- Block piecing where you piece the quilt blocks perfectly 


- Foundation piecing that helps you create quilt blocks 


- Rotary cutting for creating quick accurate pieces 


- Speed piecing where you quickly piece quilt blocks 


- Diagonal corners with which you piece corner triangles 


- Appliqué, a technique that can be done both with hand and machine 


- Getting neat, even stitches with hand quilting 


- Machine quilting that lets you save tremendous time 


- Binding helps finish the rough edges 


- Basting is a technique to hold the quilt layers together 


- Picture transfers on your quilt 


- Dying and painting your quilt fabric 


Other techniques that you will discover involve measuring the right amount of fabric for your quilt, drafting patterns, pressing your quilt and caring for your quilt. The entire process of quilting can be quite a voyage of discovery as you learn new techniques.   

The Quilting Process The first time you choose your quilting design it is best to keep it simple using cotton fabric pieces and fewer colors so that you familiarize yourself with the art. You will need to ensure that you pre-wash your quilting fabric so that they don’t shrink or run color after you make your quilt especially if you are using cotton. Begin with a simple pattern. Quilting will involve piecing the fabric, layering it, then quilting it and finally binding it. Quilts are usually begun at the center and then progressively built outwards. Remember, the most crucial step is piecing it since the top layer decides its pattern. You stitch the pieces of fabric together for your pattern. Layering involves bringing the three layers together as one. These are the top layer, the batting and the underlining or backing for the quilt. This is then quilted into a single piece using a variety of stitches. The final step is the binding, which means the finishing touches like adding a trim to the edge. 


This should give you a good idea of what quilting involves. As you progress, you can buy the tools you need to produce a professional quilt. Here you will find excellent instructional videos and books that show you various quilting techniques and tips. In addition to this, you will also find many interesting links that will tell you all you need to know about quilting. So – get started!",
Fantasy Football,"HISTORYOriginThe creation of fantasy football is attributed to Wilfred “Bill the Gill” Winkenbach during a 1962 Raiders cross-country trip in a New York hotel. Winkenbach, a limited Raiders partner, along with Bill Tunnel, a public relations manager for the Raiders, and Tribune reporter Scotty Stirling are accredited with creating a system of organization and a rule book that would eventually  become what is now fantasy football. The first game was played in Winkenbach’s home in Oakland, California. For several years the game was limited to this venue and a select few players. Making the Game PublicIn 1969, Andy Mousalimas, one of the inaugural players of the game, introduced the game to his sports bar, the King’s X in Oakland. Mousalimas opened up several leagues in his bar and it quickly became popular with his patrons. From this point, the game continued to spread, but at a slow pace. Because the game takes an entire football season to play and can only be played once a year, the game’s popularity had to compete with the limitations of the sport it was based on.  Playing OnlineThe Grandstand Sports Services was the first to offer an online way to play fantasy football in 1985. In addition to allowing online play, the service expanded to offer features like automated drafting as well as real-time scoring, trading, and transactions. Grandstand Sports Services also allowed for continuous leagues. In 1997, CBS offered the first free online fantasy football league. Other sports media websites quickly followed suit resulting in the game’s continued rise in popularity as it was now accessible to anyone with internet access.  NowFantasy football is now a cemented feature in modern pop culture. In addition to the apps, guides, and communities that have sprouted in response to the game, the game also inspired the comedy series “The League” which revolves around a group of friends and their fantasy football league.",https://www.discoverahobby.com/fantasy-football#
Start A Band,"Start A Band Information  Introduction The attraction of becoming a rock star has sparked international drama, especially since the advent of MySpace and YouTube. Anyone, it seems, can record solo or with a few friends and surface on the internet inside of twenty-four hours. This is both a blessing and a curse; true talent doesn’t necessarily need the help of a manager or public relations agent to be published in an impactful way, but because of the sheer numbers of mp3s and videos worldwide, it is difficult to be noticed among the throngs. This article is intended for any entrepreneur whose goals are to bring his music out of the garage and out into the world. 
Managing a Band Sometimes bands have an obvious leader/manager—this is star, who often has the most creative talent, and the rest of the musicians will step into the background. Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, and Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz are among the examples from pop-music history—early on, the sidemen accepted their roles as supporting players. In these situations, the star gets top billing on club marquees, while the band develops into a loyal coalition of players who take orders from the leader. These kinds of bands are open to the lead’s vision for the band, including even small things, like which musicians play solos, and when? What instruments sound good together? Can you hear the keyboardist all the time? A great way to learn broad band concepts like tempo and dynamics is to pay attention to how the professionals do it. 

A strong leader helps direct the group in a specific musical or business direction. If this person has true leadership skills, he or she will consult the group for its input and make decisions, easy or hard, that make everybody feel valued and important. A weak leader may create resentment and disharmony—and if such behavior continues, you may have to start the difficult process of choosing a new leader. 

The leader will most likely be the hardest-working member of the band. Among the leader`s duties are negotiating with neighbors over where and when to hold rehearsals, researching songs and lyrics and presenting them to the band, casting the tie-breaking vote for rehearsal time if members` schedules conflict, halting rehearsal to ensure that everybody`s input is heard, and arriving early to a gig to determine where and when to set up the equipment. 

Or, at the early stages, your best opportunity to form a band might be to form a self-contained group of musicians, who all work together to pick a style, rehearse, and perform. Some situations, especially, will demand a group vote: • Whether you`ll play a gig at a certain time and place (and for a certain amount of money) 

• Certain financial decisions that affect everybody, such as opening a band bank account 

• Whether to make a large group purchase, such as a PA system 

• Choosing a band name 

• How to disperse money from gigs, recordings, and so on 

• Set-list disputes 

• Choosing common goals   You`ll do all the fundamental band work yourselves without hiring outside people. (Once you get bigger and need help, the hiring will begin.) A self-contained group can be incredibly rewarding (or incredibly painful, if you fall in with the wrong combination of people). Whether you stay together for three weeks or an entire career, band members make emotional connections with each other and can stay friends forever. If they`re really lucky, they`ll wind up like U2, a group of Irish schoolmates who managed to stay together as a profitable and rewarding band for two decades and counting. If you find that a self-contained band works for you, consider making an Intraband 

Contract or ""band agreement"". This contract will offer some protection for what a member can do with the name, payment, ownership of songs, equipment, etc. if/when he/she leaves the band. Solving this now will help to avoid disputes in the future. Keep in mind, though, it`s common that these kinds of issues will turn off potential band mates. So, make sure they are in agreement and vested before forcing a contract on them. 

Whether you choose to play in a band led by someone else or whether you choose a self-contained band, either configuration is equally respectable—and fun. 
Getting Started These days, there are more kinds of bands playing more styles of music in more configurations than anyone could possibly count. Some are party bands, playing upbeat versions of familiar rock `n` roll songs to get people dancing. Some are wedding bands, playing a specific roster of standards predetermined by the bride and groom. Some will play original music, written and performed by the band members, in an attempt to fill clubs and sell compact discs. Some even combine amazingly opposite styles, such as classical with metal (such as Apocalyptica playing Metallica), techno with classical (Vanessa Mae), or folky bluegrass with rock (Robert Plant with Alison Kraus). Just use the instruments and voices your band brings to the table. No immediate expenditures need to be made. Experiment. Don’t be afraid to try a violin against steel drums or a didgeridoo in tandem with harpsichord. Don’t be afraid to change your musical vision if the music seems to be headed an unexpected direction. It`s not important, at this early stage, to know exactly which of these configurations, if any, you`d like to be. Try to let your style evolve, rather than defining it so rigidly that there`s no room for experimentation or dissent. The Rolling Stones started out as a blues band, performing Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry songs, but have evolved over the decades into perhaps the most successful rock `n` roll band in the world. 

One of the first questions you`ll need to tackle is, ""How many musicians should be in the band?"" Often the answer will be obvious, as you`ll have three or four people who show up to practice prepared to sing or play certain instruments. But you may have to make the membership decision based on your collective musical vision—duos sound drastically different from quartets, and it`s worth knowing the pros and cons of each configuration. Perhaps the ultimate rock-and-pop lineup is a quartet, usually with drums, bass, guitar, vocals and, if the singer plays an instrument, perhaps a keyboard or second guitar. It may not seem like much, but when all four band members play together, they can create a powerful sound (or a horrible racket, depending on how good they are). Classic quartets include The Beatles, The Who, The Sex Pistols, The Clash, X, The Replacements, Jane`s Addiction, and the Foo Fighters. You can have as many musicians as you want, of course, as long as the lineup doesn`t start to mess up internal communication or divide your earnings into unacceptably small portions. If you’re looking for additional musicians, look to the internet at such places as MySpace Music or even Craigslist. Over time, this is becoming a tremendous resource for finding (and auditioning) prospective members. 

Come up with a good name. Make it something easy to pronounce, easy to remember, and one that will associate what you play with who you are. It should be something everyone is proud of and will look nice on a business card. If you can think of an appropriate logo to tie to it, new listeners will find you even easier remember. 

Practice covers and standards until you get a feel for exactly what your new sound is. This is important even if you want to compose your own music because you can get a feel for how everyone’s instruments and voices blend together. “Tweaking” now for the sound you want might save a lot of hurt feelings in the future. Perhaps one vocalist comes up with better harmonies, or perhaps another does not have the wide range needed for solos. Or maybe you’ll find that the guitar work on a certain song muddies up what the mandolin is trying to do. You can work with what you already know to fine tune for the genre of music you want to play. 
Rehearsals You will need to compare notes and choose the most commonly available practice times for as many of your band members as possible. Be ready to take into consideration various work schedules, family duties, and religious commitments. There is bound to be at least one time everyone can meet, even if it’s just for a couple hours each week on a Sunday afternoon. The more you can practice, though, the better. It is these times that you will work through complex passages and create your personalized arrangements. These are also the times for you to bond with your band mates and knit together your unique sound. You can get acquainted with their styles so that you’ll know what comes naturally for them and what they have difficulty with. This helps you anticipate how to “roll with the punches” on stage later, should they forget to play a verse or a musical break, for example. 

Before you start rehearsal, take time to tune up. And if you play piano or drums, be patient and avoid the distracting urge to fiddle around while the guitarists tune up. It sounds so simple: Decide on a musical key and have everybody play in that key. But…what if the guitarist prefers E and the pianist can only play in C and F? What if everybody enjoys B-flat, but you insist on playing Roy Orbison`s ""Oh, Pretty Woman,"" which, according to your sheet music, is written in A? The basic rule is to let the singer pick the key. Otherwise, he or she will have to strain and the song will sound terrible. Guitarists and pianists can always learn new chords, but inexperienced singers comfortable in C will have a hard time switching to D-flat on short notice. 

Another great boon to the rehearsal regimen is to practice while a recorder is going. Often, some magical passages will surface during a practice session only to be forgotten by the song’s end. Having even a simple recorder handy can save you from having to re-invent the wheel. In addition to catching a good passage, recording is a very useful (though sometimes unkind) means of feedback. 

Practice with a metronome. This will help to prevent bad habits, such as speeding up or slowing down on passages between verses. Even drummers don’t have a perfect sense of rhythm all the time. Bands that have been playing for a great deal of time together often develop what is called “muscle memory,” meaning their fingers fall into place faster than the tempo is allowing for. This causes fluctuations in the tempo and instability among the various voices of the tune. A metronome, though aggravating, is a good way to get back to the correct tempo. 

And last but not least, show up for practices on time! Nothing will drive a wedge between band mates like lax attendance and absences. If the time or day isn’t working out, find another. Every member is integral to the overall chemistry of your band, and it’s okay to make that known. 
Finances Most of your finances should be pretty easy to handle for the first year or so. Since your goal will be promotion, a lot of gigs will be performed with band recognition in mind, i.e., open mics, benefits, coffeehouses, jam nights, etc. Much of your initial compensation may be paid in coffee, meals, or beer. But once you’re able to provide a venue with a contract and are reimbursed monetarily, it is time to set up a bank account for cashing checks. This is usually the time the band needs to choose someone to manage their funds. The band can either be established as a business entity or the manager can register the band’s name as a sole proprietorship. Either way, the goal should be to make the band’s income IRS-traceable and fair. The manager is responsible for cashing checks and getting payment to band members within a reasonable time frame. The manager will also be the one to handle doing the taxes if the band is established as a business. 

The manager is usually the one to compose the band’s contract. A contract is necessary for summarizing the parties involved, how much will be paid to whom and when, where the venue is and at what time, and also the length of the gig. Though the hiring party can always ask you to play longer for more money, it is essential that a stopping time be specified in the contract. Defining the duration of the performance is key to keeping both your band and the hiring party in a professional relationship. 
Growing a Fan Base As mentioned earlier, acquiring a good fan base is slow work. But don’t spend all your time on your own work. Take interest in other live music, especially in bands that are playing the type of music that is compatible with your own. These are the bands you are choosing to be your unspoken “mentor” for helping you to get involved in the music scene of your choice. At some point, they may become familiar enough with what you do that you can ask (or be asked!) to partner with them in a venue. Even if it’s just one time, your band’s name will be associated with an already-recognized band that has made its mark on the local scene. 

And don`t forget to invite all your friends and relatives to your early gigs. They may well be the supportive core of all your early concerts, and they`re likely to stick with the band as it gets bigger and bigger. Don`t take these ""early groupies"" for granted—they may be the difference between a crowd of 5 strangers and an energetic crowd of 50 or 75 fans. 
Negotiating After a gig or two, you may have a little bit of leverage to negotiate for a higher salary. What salary should this be? Have a number in mind when you deal with potential clients. Figure out how much it`ll cost to play your gig—regular expenses include gas, guitar strings, drumsticks, gaffer tape, and possibly, renting sound and lighting systems. In a perfect world, your gig salary will cover these costs and leave the band with spending money. 

Nonetheless, until you`re a big star, it`s generally better to make a little less money and get the gig. Stubborn negotiating has its place, but don`t shut yourself out of an opportunity, especially if you know the club booker or wedding planner doesn`t have much of a budget to play with. 
The First Gig Practice, practice, practice. And then practice some more. Things that go wrong with performances will be things you never dreamed possible, so it’s best to be prepared for the worst. Have set lists ready to cover every minute of your performance times (give or take a minute or two for introductions and banter). Have your stage diagram with you, detailing who will stand where, the locations of the speakers, monitors and mixing board, and whose input goes where into the board. In some cases it is best to visit your venue beforehand to get an idea of how the stage is set up. And if a sound person will be handling your sound, send ahead your stage diagram so he can have everything ready to go beforehand. Few things bother venue management more than bands that arrive late or take too long in setting up and tuning. 

Make sure you know the answer to the following questions: 

• Where are the power outlets, and how many does the club have? 

• Where can you park while loading your equipment? 

• Where can you park during the show? 

• How big is the stage, and will it fit all your musicians and respective gear? 

• Is the club or venue generous about sound-check time? 

• Do you need to bring your own PA system? 

• What nights have the rowdiest crowds? 

• Are there certain influential ""regulars"" you might need to win over? If so, what songs do they like? 

• Are the venue managers prompt about payment?   As a rule of thumb, plan to arrive two hours before your show at a familiar venue. If the club is out of town, or you`ve never been there, give yourself three hours. We also recommend compiling a ""gig sheet,"" including the club manager`s name and contact information, numbers for other bands on the bill and so on. This will help if you arrive early to find the door locked. 

Also, ask in advance when the venue`s doors are open to the public. If you arrive two hours early, and the club is already filled with people, it`ll be hard to walk through the club, let alone conduct your business. 

Finally, unless you`re meticulously organized (most musicians aren`t), prepare a checklist before every gig. Include preshow packing details on the list: Do you have transportation? Gas money? Does the equipment fit? And don`t forget to account for the equipment: Include check boxes for guitars, amps, gaffer tape, set list, props, and a clean T-shirt. 

Multiple guitars, amps, drums, and microphones—not to mention the musicians themselves—probably won`t fit into the bassist`s Yugo. Generally speaking, each band member will need a total of one car for himself and his equipment. 

Consider borrowing a truck or van from a friend, or finding a cheap one-day rate. Have everybody meet at the rehearsal space, several hours before show time, to load up and caravan to the concert. Allow extra time for crises and van breakdowns. And be especially kind to the drummer, who has the most stuff. 

Once you walk through the door of a club, whether it`s for an audition, rehearsal, or gig, everybody is important. Bring your own door-stopper so the ID-checking bouncer doesn`t have to hold open the door for every patron. Tip waitresses and bartenders. It goes without saying that you should be courteous and professional toward the people who will be working with you. You want everybody in the club to think you`re the best band they`ve ever heard and, equally important to landing a future gig, the easiest one to work with. 
Equipment When it comes to equipment, start small and simple. Even most acoustic guitars come with a jack for plugging in, and certain instruments, i.e., trap sets need no amplification. Many venues keep their own sound systems on site so that when musicians roll through, they can simply hook up. But if you are going to have to provide your own sound, you will probably not need more than twelve- to fifteen-inch speakers, an 8-channel mixer, and perhaps a monitor up front to help you hear over a noisy crowd. If your band is playing acoustic instruments that need microphones to be heard, condenser mics or Shure SM57s usually work best. For handling vocals, the Shure SM58 mic usually works just fine. You will need microphone stands and cabling, of course. Use the equipment for a practice or two to get an idea of what your settings will be on the mixer. But remember, acoustics change as a room fills up with people. Expect to be tweaking your sound (or having someone on hand to help) once you’re on stage. The main point is that you shouldn’t have to overextend everyone’s budgets just to get onto a stage the first dozen times. If you find that something is not working, it is then that you and your band mates can discuss budgeting, fine tuning, and expanding your sound system. 
Hitting the Road Getting big in your hometown is a wonderful thing. But it has its drawbacks. If you play too often at local clubs, ""familiarity breeds contempt"" syndrome may creep in and promoters, bookers, and even fans may decide they have other things to do than hear your band once or twice a week. That`s when it`s time to travel. 

Taking it on the road is perhaps the best investment you can make. It can be grueling, and costly, but if you do it right you`ll immediately see growth—perhaps the kind of growth that attracts managers, booking agents, radio stations, and even prominent record labels. Once you`ve established a home base, it can never hurt to develop several satellite bases. 

Before setting up a trip, consider the realities of taking the band on the road. Yes, travel can be a blast—rock history is filled with outrageous road stories—from dramatic accounts of The Who wrecking hotel rooms during all night bashes to those guys from the movie Almost Famous singing along happily to Elton John`s ""Tiny Dancer."" What all such descriptions leave out are the countless hours of driving and waiting--hours and hours of each. 

So make sure you`re ready. Is this the right time? Are all the band members emotionally—and physically—prepared for a grueling trip? Countless bands fall apart upon embarking the open road because of the close quarters they must share for unbearably long periods of time. Even the smallest irritations can lead to all out warfare. Many aspiring bands buy the classic touring bus only to find that it becomes a gas-guzzling liability, draining hefty amounts of their income in refueling and insurance costs. In addition, sharing the responsibilities of driving the bus long hours becomes a drag, especially at night. Are you sure you`ve exhausted your local options? And perhaps most important, will the trip be a boost, from a financial or emotional perspective, for the band? If the answer is yes, or if you can find a quick out-of-town gig perfect for a short, nothing-to-lose road trip, it`s time to deal with transportation. 
Marketing and Merchandising Everyone looks forward to the day when the band’s first CD is released or when they have a table full of logo’d t-shirts, stickers, and buttons to sell. But keep in mind that all these things take space, so include their transport details in your gig packing plan, along with your equipment! Start out by ordering CDs and t-shirts in small numbers to make sure the items will sell. Then, (even though it may cost somewhat more this way), order more when you’ve sold them. Between sets, put those items on stage where people’s eyes will already be focused. If your items are squirreled away behind stage or in another room, you may miss out on extra sales. 

Have an internet presence. These days it couldn’t be easier! Set up a website and keep your band’s bios and a constantly updated calendar there. Include links to favorable reviews and comments that your fans have left you online. Hint: provide links to places where you’ve performed and also to locations where your CD is being sold. Set up a Facebook page. Facebook makes it very easy to share fresh mp3’s and alert your fans to new events on your calendar. ReverbNation has a similar system. Use YouTube to install videos that you or others have recorded of your band. Post comments about your band’s activities on your blog. Ask your friends to post your band announcements on their blogs and websites. Have a mailing list so you can send e-mails directly to fans’ inboxes and cell phones. Try Facebook and Twitter. And beyond that, you can employ some of the more conventional means of marketing, such as flyers, posters, and media announcements. Post your announcements at coffee shops, music stores, the venues themselves, neighboring establishments, in your car window, on your instrument case. 

When all is said and done, your active life as a musician could be brilliant. And if you’re lucky enough, a stadium full of inspired fans will agree.",
Jigsaw Puzzles,"Jigsaw Puzzles Information  Introduction A jigsaw puzzle is a puzzle that requires the assembly of numerous small, oddly shaped, interlocking pieces. 
History The first jigsaw puzzle was created around 1760 by an Englishman named John Spilsbury. He used a fretsaw (hand held saw used for intricate cutting) to cut the pieces of maps from mahogany board. He boxed them and sold them for children to assemble. John Spilsbury called them the Dissected Maps. In the following years, scenes were added to the maps by those who copied John Spilsbury’s idea. 

By the 1800s puzzles were made to educate wealthy children. The puzzles continued to be made of various woods and in larger pieces. Most pieces were not interlocking. By the later part of the century changes were occurring in the production of the puzzles. The wood was thinner, better saws had been invented by this point, and the pictures were more varied and colorful. In the late 1800s Ralph Tuck, a German, was instrumental in advancements in the way the puzzles were made. He developed new techniques for creating the jigsaw puzzle. 

By this point, more changes were occurring not only in the manufacturing of the jigsaw puzzle but also the market to which they were sold. Adults became fascinated with the puzzles. Due to new technology by the turn of the century, the early 1900s brought about many changes in the production. Because of new machinery and new materials, production increased at a lower cost causing the jigsaw puzzles to be available to a wider population. 

After World War I there was a booming demand for the jigsaw puzzle. By this time, cardboard was used for the puzzles and the cost was a fraction of the cost of the original puzzle. Now the puzzles contained as many as 1,000 pieces. 

Currently, millions of jigsaw puzzles are produced and purchased every year. 

Interestingly enough, jigsaw puzzles are gaining even more popularity currently. Wooden jigsaw puzzles are also growing in popularity. Online jigsaw puzzles are almost as popular as cardboard and wooden puzzles and are growing in demand. Companies are constantly striving to create more challenging and cutting edge puzzles. Many accessories are being developed to accompany the puzzles such as glues, frames, and carrying cases. 
Uses for Jigsaw Puzzle Jigsaw puzzles are great hobbies; and they are not just a hobby for children. Men and Women throughout the world today both take advantage of jigsaw puzzles and the hours of fun they can offer. Jigsaw puzzles are becoming more and more popular. Why, because they are an activity that is affordable, relaxing, a bonding activity among family and friends, and educational. 

They are a challenge and a very relaxing activity. As you find the pieces and fit them together you feel a sense of satisfaction. After a stressful day or situation, there is nothing like sitting down to an enjoyable hobby; becoming lost in it and leaving the world behind. 

When the puzzles are completed some individuals mount them for pictures for their wall putting them in attractive frames. There are so many varied scenes on jigsaw puzzles currently that anyone can find the right puzzle to suit their taste. There are other craft projects suitable to the use of jigsaw puzzles, such as table tops covered with glass or any other furniture for that matter. The uses for jigsaw puzzles, in terms of crafts and decorations are only limited by your imagination. Some people complete the jigsaw puzzles and either trade them or put them away for another day. 

Jigsaw puzzles also serve very important educational purposes. Puzzles are commonly used in schools to teach in all areas of education. They are also used for therapeutic purposes in counseling facilities, and mental health facilities to diagnose and treat certain disorders. For example, children who are abused, as part of diagnostic tools, puzzles are used to determine the situation. Schools use them as behavior disorder treatment tools and special education tools to teach and treat the students. 

Jigsaw puzzles make a wonderful and lasting gift to a friend or loved one. This type of gift gives the person you care enough to give it to hours of pleasure and enjoyment. A gift such as this can also be used to send a message to your loved one or friend. Puzzles today not only have the gift of existing text and pictures to indicate a message to that special person but you can also have a jigsaw puzzle custom created to you specifications. For example, someone you care about has a birthday approaching. You can give them a puzzle for their birthday to signify the day as a special day with a special picture or message on the puzzle you choose. Or you can also have a puzzle mounted and framed that this special person has completed and wants to keep it. Another example is grandmas birthday is coming up and you want to make it special. Order a special jigsaw puzzle with a picture of all the grandkids on it and a message, “we love you grandma”. Another gift that would brighten their day is to give them a computer program of jigsaw puzzles. When it comes to jigsaw puzzle gifts, the ideas are endless and the variations and messages you can send that person you care about are abundant. 
Benefits of Jigsaw Puzzles Jigsaw puzzles have many benefits. They are entertaining and educational, especially for children. Puzzles occupy that time when the children are out of school and have nothing to do. Puzzles are a fun way to teach children, taking the boredom out of learning. It gives them a way to vent energy in a constructive way and is the better for it. 

Jigsaw puzzles can be an economical way to bring family and friends together. With costs rising at a frightening rate there is still a way to have fun together without breaking the bank. More than one person working on a puzzle can actually bring about a bonding among those individuals. Jigsaw puzzles can strengthen the family unite while giving them enjoyment and relaxation. In today’s society, when the family spends less time together, doing jigsaw puzzles together is a constructive, wholesome activity that the whole family unit can share. 

Jigsaw puzzles can be psychologically beneficial as well and in turn biologically beneficial. We live in very stressful times. Those activities that help us relax can only be of benefit. When you sit down to do a jigsaw puzzle it gives you a chance to forget the world around you and get lost in the challenge and accomplishment of the puzzle you are working on. By relaxing, you are giving your body and mind a chance to rest and get caught up. It has been medically proven that stress lowers the immune system, causing us to be more susceptible to disease and illness. By finding ways to relax we are protecting our minds and bodies from the pressures and ills that surround us. 
Types of Jigsaw Puzzles There are many types of Jigsaw Puzzles. The amount of pieces to the puzzles can be in the range 100s to 1000s. They are made of materials such as wood, cardboard, plastic, and other synthetic materials. The illustrations and text on them are varied as well. Many of the puzzles are scenic or of animals. There is also education informational and pictures. Puzzles can even be ordered with a photograph such as a family or individual photo or a photo of something special that the person wants to have put in a jigsaw puzzle form. Nearly anything you can think of can be put on the face of a jigsaw puzzle. 
Choosing and Purchasing a Jigsaw Puzzle When choosing a jigsaw puzzle several things need to be considered. You must decide first, what are you likes and dislikes in terms of pictures, colors, and themes. For example, is your choice scenic or animals or maybe you prefer another theme such as military, urban, or perhaps another theme available. Do you prefer bright colors or deeper colors? Do you prefer to custom create your own puzzle? You also have to decide on the size of the puzzle you want. They can range from 100s of pieces to 1000s of pieces. You need to choose the degree of difficulty you want as well. The degree of difficulty is very important to consider, actually. Are you looking for something to keep you busy for hours or days or are you interested in an activity that only takes an hour or two. The choices are endless. Then you have to choose what material you want your puzzle to be. Most commonly the jigsaw puzzles are made of heavy duty cardboard. However, there are puzzles made of other material such a plastic, wood, and even rubber. 

These choices you make when choosing a jigsaw puzzle will of course be affected by the recipient of the puzzle. For example, perhaps the puzzle is for a child. In this case you may want a brightly colored, cardboard puzzle, of perhaps a few hundred pieces. If the puzzle will be for an adult woman you might want a scenic picture on the puzzle, of a thousand pieces, made of heavy duty cardboard. If you want the puzzle for a man you may want to purchase one which has a military or hunting picture, of appropriate color and a thousand of more pieces. 

Another component that affects your choice of puzzle is the purpose or intended use of the puzzle. For example, if you or the recipients of the puzzle are going to use it for a hobby you would determine the aesthetics of the jigsaw puzzle by the individual taste. The difficulty level would be determined by the age and intellectual ability of the individual the puzzle is intended for. 

The cost is another important issue. Because a jigsaw puzzle is not something you can use up in one use, you will have it to use time and time again. An important aspect of purchasing a puzzle is your purpose for purchasing it. Are you intending to complete the puzzle just for recreation or do you intend to do the puzzle and then mount it and hang it on your wall? Jigsaw puzzles are a relatively reasonably priced activity, ranging from $5.00 and up. To make it even more reasonably priced you can trade friends and relatives puzzles or barrow puzzles from each other. You also have the option of buying them second hand. Some individuals even enjoy leaving them sit for a year or two and then doing them again. 

However you choose to obtain your jigsaw puzzle there are many ways to accomplish this. As I said earlier, depending on your purpose for the puzzle you can trade or borrow. The puzzles may be purchased in any number of places; many different types of stores carry puzzles or you can purchase them on line or in catalogs. There are also rummage sales and second hand stores to buy them from. 
Conclusion Jigsaw puzzles are currently one of the top of the line activities. They require little knowledge to participate in, and are not an expensive activity. Jigsaw puzzles are hours of fun without breaking the bank. They make a tremendous and versatile gift. Even if you give the gift of a puzzle every year to the same person you need never repeat the gift. This is due to the fact there is such a varied selection of puzzles in appearance, type, size, and style and also because you can have them custom made to your satisfaction. They are a fitting gift for man, woman or child of every taste and preference. Jigsaw puzzles serve many purposes including education, busy work, hobby, therapy, bonding, and gift giving at an affordable price. What more could you ask for? Don’t you just have the overwhelming urge to do a jigsaw puzzle now?",
RV Travelling,"RV Travelling Information  Introduction The concept of traveling in a recreational vehicle is steadily becoming more popular, especially among families and retirees. One of the reasons for this is it allows for more freedom—you aren’t limited to one region because of sleeping and eating accommodations. The fact that it is cheaper in the long run is important to those traveling with families. While recreational vehicles are not designed for long-term lodging, they do have the capacity to sleep several people at the same time and having cooking and bathroom facilities. 

Retirees are investing in the idea of RV traveling more frequently. Many are selling or renting out their homes for months at a time as they hit the road and travel across the United States or other countries depending on their locality. For the price they would pay for motels and dining out, they can travel in their RV without worrying about where they are going to eat or sleep and how much it will cost. 
Description and Function of an RV Recreational vehicle or RV is, in North America, the usual term for a motor vehicle equipped with living space and amenities found in a home. 

Australian English: The term ""recreational vehicle"" may refer to a sport utility vehicle (SUV or 4x4). 

British English: The term ""recreational vehicle"" may refer to a sport utility vehicle, Dune buggies or ATVs. Terms covering some of the vehicles classified as ""recreational vehicle"" in North America are camper van or motorhome (see below) and caravan. The term RV is used for imported North America vehicles. 

While the terminology used in many countries may differ, in most cases an RV is still viewed as an inexpensive way to take a vacation or do extensive traveling. Since they are available in various sizes, it is possible to travel with a small or medium size family for weeks or months at a time.  
Features A recreational vehicle normally includes a kitchen, a bathroom, a bedroom and a living room. In other countries the terms caravan or camper van are more common, and the vehicles themselves vary, typically being smaller than in North America.  
Function RVs are intended for everything from brief leisure activities such as vacations and camping, to full-time living, for which they are often parked in special trailer parks. (However, many trailer parks are reserved just for mobile homes, not to be confused with RVs and motorhomes.) RVs can also be rented in most major cities and tourist areas. They are occasionally used as mobile offices for business travelers and often include customizations such as extra desk space, an upgraded electrical system, a generator, and satellite Internet. Other RV`s serve as traveling permanent homes. 
RV Lifestyle There are many different reasons people might choose the RV lifestyle even for traveling across the country or just for a vacation or short weekend camping trip. The concept of RV traveling has reached record levels with almost one family in 12 in the United States owning an RV. That means there are 8 millions TV households in America alone with previous statistics showing the typical motorhome, travel trailer or fifth wheel owner being 49 years old and married. However, a more recent study the University of Michigan conducted indicated the age span of those who own motorhomes, travel trailers or fifth wheels are usually between the ages of 35-54. 

One of the things that makes RV traveling some popular is because people don’t have to worry about packing—they can maintain the RV in ready condition for their next trip. This style of traveling is great for family vacations and can help strengthen the bond because everyone is able to spend time together and they tend to work together in order to make the trip more enjoyable. 

Unlike travelers who have to worry about motel accommodations and places to eat, RV travelers don’t have to sacrifice the comforts of their homes during their travels. They can enjoy many different sites including small towns, beaches, parks, mountains and campgrounds whenever it is convenient for them without the concerns about finding room accommodations and paying higher prices during high seasons. In addition, if you purchase a sport utility RV you can even bring your personal vehicle with you so you don’t have to use the RV to travel around the vacation sites. 

In terms of cost, it is possible to find an RV for as little as $4,000 and as much as $400,000 for the Class A motorhome. Even those who don’t want to leave the comforts of home behind will be pleased because new RVs include fully equipped baths and kitchens, central heating and air conditioning, stereos with surround sound and plasma television sets. Cost wise, a family a four can expect to spend approximately 74 percent less when they travel by RV compared to staying in motels or vacation rental homes with these estimates also factoring in the cost of traveling to the vacation destination whether by ship, air or private car. 

In addition to cost factors RV owners have an immense amount of flexibility and freedom when they are traveling. There is no need to worry about traveling on someone else’s schedule, lines in the airport, restrictions on what you can bring along and making advance reservations unless the RV park requires advance notice. RVs also allow people an inexpensive way to travel away from home on a regular basis—even weekends—for camping and other events. Because you don’t have to worry about unpacking when you return home from a trip, you can have more time to simply spend with the family. 
RV Traveling with Children Any vacation can be difficult when you are traveling with children—RV traveling is no exception. However, you can eliminate some of the potential problems if you plan ahead of time and don’t just spring the trip on children. While this may work well for adults, it is not a good idea for children—at least not very young ones. Those old enough to assist in planning the trip should be allowed to do so; it will help them feel more a part of the experience and they will feel less resentful about being “made” to go. 

When you plan to travel with children you and your travel companion, whether a spouse, significant other or just a friend, should help develop a list of fun places you can go that the children will enjoy. Of course, budget constraints may put a damper on some distances and activities, but you want to discuss the ideas with the children and give them insight into those activities that are within your budget. 

Once you know where you can afford to travel you want to map out those destinations and plot the directions: today GPS makes it much easier to accomplish this because you can save those destinations and directions to call up when you are ready. You will be able to even identify rest stops and other things you may want to see along your travels. An internet search will help you find different attractions and RV parks, resorts and campgrounds where you may choose to stop for a couple of days with the intention of seeing all the sights in a specific area. 

If you are planning a trip with children who have not traveled, slept in an RV or spent a night away from home, you may want to have a trial run before you leave on your trip. You can have the “dry run” the night before your trip or even a few days earlier right where you park the RV. It is always a good idea to allow children to get used to staying in the RV overnight before they have to spend an entire day traveling in it to an unfamiliar location. When the younger children don’t have to worry about where they will sleep at night when you are traveling, they will be able to enjoy the traveling and the sights you pass along the way. 

Unless you absolutely have to be at a specific place at a specific time, plan your trip so you have extra time every day without rushing. You will come across many places you can explore during your trip, and children need to stop frequently. You also want to make sure you stop early enough to allow the children and everyone else to enjoy the evening. 

During the planning stages of your trip you need to incorporate ways for the children to remain entertained, amused or just busy. The size of a motorhome provides children with plenty of space for playing table games and even some video games. You need to be careful, however, and make sure the children understand they cannot play any games that require them to move around while the RV is in motion such as tag, hide and seek and any type of interactive video games. They can only play those games that allow them to remain in a seated position. 

Audio tapes, DVDs and CDs are several items you can bring along to keep the children occupied. Teens can take the time before the trip to put plenty of music on the iPods so they can be entertained while they are traveling. Since some teens tend to like to dance to music, it is important for them to understand they cannot get up and move around; just because they are teens and no longer “children” does not mean there is a different set of safety rules. 

There are many different games children can develop to entertain themselves along the way—license plate poker, picking out cars of a particular color and many more. While children may need to stop more frequently along the way, there is no need to stop for bathroom breaks unless you are traveling with a tent trailer that does not have an accessible bathroom. 

If you are traveling with school age children you can provide each one with some paper, a clipboard, pencil and pen. Use Google Maps to print out some of the places you will be visiting and allow each child to follow along. You also want to print sheets that have other things they can look for such as railroad crossings, stop signs, a helicopter, etc.—they can then check those items off as they find them. 

Before the trip visit a dollar store to purchase some items you can use for special awards. You will usually be able to find things such as magnetic checker/chess sets and other games that are great to use in the car. Do not give out all of the treasures you bring along but keep them separated for emergencies. 

Children may find the thought of an RV resort with a swimming pool and playground area quite exciting. Do not avoid their questions about how much longer until they arrive at your destination but provide them with an estimate that is reasonably accurate while also providing some insight into some sights they might see along the road. 

RV parks are usually equipped with restrooms, showers and sometimes laundry rooms, all of which are important when you are traveling with more than one child. This prevents the problem of having to tote all the dirty laundry home or having to find a Laundromat within the town where you park the RV. The key to a great RV camping trip or vacation is having all of the necessary facilities and amenities within the RV or the RV park. 

The planning of your trip should include assigning chores the children can do when you arrive at your destination. They need to first tend to their own belongings and keep them together neatly in an assigned area, but you should also assign each one a “family” chore based on their age. This will allow everyone to enjoy the vacation instead of one or two people being responsible for all the cleanup duties. 
Where to Find RV Parks In the United States alone there are more than 16,000 public and privately owned RV campgrounds that offer the pleasures of a resort and include amenities such as health spas, golf courses and tennis courts. Recent studies show that because of the popularity of RVs people are traveling shorter distances and on shorter breaks. Weekend trips are becoming more popular in the RV as well. Travelers in the 21st century don’t want to be bothered with planning a trip but just want to get into their vehicles and drive to their destinations—or maybe their lack of a destination as the case may be.",
Sports Collectibles,"Sports Collectibles InformationINTRODUCTIONPeople from all walks of life have a passion for sports and their sports heroes. Throughout the years, sports have moved from a pastime to a serious business venture worth billions of dollars to the right people. Athletes now make more in a week than their counterparts made in a year, or a career fifty or one hundred years ago.While the fans can only seem to appreciate these superstar athletes from a distance, sports memorabilia has become a serious enterprise for many people. Even these athletes who make endless sums of cash don’t seem to be immune to the decadent art of greed and will charge young children fifty dollars or more for their autograph and a baseball, or a baseball card.There are items from past championship teams as well as some of the greatest players in the entire world of sports that sell for millions of dollars. A single baseball can sell for over a million dollars, if it’s authenticated to be the ball that actually was used at that time.Baseball cards are the most common item thought about when talking about sports memorabilia, but it can include a number of other items.The term sports memorabilia usually refers to anything that can be directly connected to a sports event or personality. These items are generally gathered by the fans of the particular sport, athlete or team that the item signifies or by collectors who find value in the rarity time-value of these collectibles. ""Sports memorabilia"" often refers to autographed sports items as well.WHAT IS THE FASCINATION?Ask a dozen psychiatrists what the fascination is with sports memorabilia and you will likely encounter a dozen different answers. Some attribute it to youthful exuberance when these people were children. Others can categorize it as an obsession with something that they feel they can connect with on some level.Others may describe it as simple lust for money.Whatever the reason, sports memorabilia has become an enormous business for millions of people around the world. Becoming a professional athlete is considered so rare that only a fraction of all of the high school and college stars in their sport ever make it to that level.Even fewer are ever able to become the best at what they do. In tennis, for example, Raphael Nadal recently become only the seventh player in history to win all four major tennis championships in his career. When you consider how many professional tennis players have come along through the years, that is a rare accomplishment. Even those who are considered some of the best players ever, such as John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, and Bjorn Borg didn’t manage that feat.With that, someone who managed to collect a piece of that historic win for Nadal, whether it was a programme or a tennis ball or a signed bandana that he wore during that record tying win, will be worth a tremendous amount to certain sports memorabilia collectors.Becoming involved in sports memorabilia collecting requires a passion that goes beyond simply enjoying watching a game. It delves into an aspect that some may consider intrusive to life, or obsessive, but for others, it is simply a way to live vicariously through their sports idols, to remember golden ages from the past, or to invest in the hope that the object that they came across will be worth a great deal of money someday.STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE: STARTING A COLLECTIONPerhaps you’ve been a sports fan for a long time, but haven’t really collected many items from your athletic heroes or the teams that you love the most, but you want to start now. Or maybe you have been collecting for years, storing them in a box in a nice, safe, dry place and are thinking that it’s time to get organized with your treasures.Either way, it’s never to late to get started in a sports memorabilia collecting life.One of the most important first steps that you need to do is to educate yourself on the value of different items. Some cards, though they may look old, will not hold their value too well. Others will register off the charts.It’s a lot like stamp or coin collecting in that condition and printing make a significant difference. There are many books printed and updated annually that will list the most popular and common items, from uniforms to trading cards to programs and ticket stubs. These books will list the demand for some of these rare items and the condition factor.Perhaps you have a rookie Babe Ruth card in a box somewhere, but it’s not in the best shape. Maybe it has some creases or folds in it and the picture is slightly worn. Believe it or not, that card may still be worth a lot of money to the right collector.If you’re looking to begin a collection but you don’t want to spend a lot of money on it, then think current sports. You can post ads through the Internet or in your local newspaper advertising what you’re looking for and that you’re not looking for priceless gems.Someone may have gone to the playoffs last year and their ticket stub isn’t worth much to them. If it’s something you’d like to add to your new collection, then you can offer them a few dollars for it. Over time, you never know how much it could be worth.ITEMS OF INTERESTWhile many people tend to pay a great deal of attention to baseball cards, there are, of course, many other items that constitute sports memorabilia and these can all be separated into two types: modern and antique. From baseball gloves or part of a uniform worn or used by Babe Ruth to the baseball that broke the all-time home run record hit by Barry Bonds, from the cleats worn by Emmitt Smith to the jersey of Mean Joe Green, there are countless sports memorabilia items throughout the world and basically what it all comes down to is price and availability.Some sports stars make their wares available, for a nominal fee, on a regular basis. There are those athletes who donate their memorabilia for charity and, of course, those who sell it to line their own pockets.Sports memorabilia doesn’t even have to be limited to the major professional sports, such as football, baseball, hockey, or basketball, but can cover any number of sports, including track and field, swimming, table tennis, golf, and anything else under the sun.People consider sports memorabilia to be objects that were used or worn by world leaders and dignitaries when they played or participated in an activity. Even auto racing, such as the world of NASCAR, has an enormous fan base, as well as horse racing and other types of competition.When you look around enough, you will find a host of items that are collectible, from Diecast figures to ‘Bobble’ head dolls, from posters and special sportswear, such as the Nike Air Jordans. When these items are in perfect condition and maintained well, some of them can be worth a great deal of money when enough time has passed.CATALOGUING AND DISPLAYING OF SPORTS MEMORABILIAOne of the online encyclopedias mention that collecting sports memorabilia is based predominantly on sports that have a particular interest to the individual. It also mentions that sports memorabilia collecting is often done with a high level of organization, is catalogued well, and ultimately displayed attractively, for all visitors or guests to see.When you begin your own sports memorabilia collection, you will want an efficient way to catalogue the items that you own. For starters, pick up a notebook or an accounting ledger. A notebook tends to be a more economical and efficient method for cataloguing, simply because of the fact that you can add many personal notes about each item in the description. You can add comments such as where you picked up the memorabilia item, how much you paid or whether you personally received it from an athlete, and any personal impressions, thoughts, or ideas about the item.Computer spreadsheets and other programs can also be used for cataloguing items, and this is especially useful when your collection begins to grow beyond a few select items. By using a computer, you can organize these items by any number of parameters, including alphabetically, by team, sport, player, year, and a number of other factors.DISPLAYINGWhen you’re ready to show off your sports memorabilia, whether you do this at home or in the office, you will want to make sure that the items are protected. The more valuable the item, of course, the more care you want to show it.Using clear display boxes or product frames is one of the best ways to protect and display your sports memorabilia. Frame manufacturers make impressive looking displays that are ideal for just about any purpose, from showing off a team ball autographed by all the players of that particular year to a banner with your favorite team’s insignia on it.How you display your sports memorabilia is almost as important as what kind of items you have. Make sure that you give them the respect they deserve and display them with loving care.WHAT TO FOCUS ONWhile there are a dozen different professional sports to choose from, most people don’t have a passion for all of them. Some actually only prefer one or two. Maybe three or four.When you’re looking to begin or build a sports memorabilia, whether it’s for prestige, display cases, or for long-term investment, focus on the sports that matter the most to you. If you’ve never been to a soccer game and couldn’t care less about the sport, then it’s not wise to try and collect items from this sport. If you happen to stumble upon something, like a programme from a championship game, then it could add something to your collection, but it’s best to simply focus on what interests you most.When you start stepping outside of your interest level, then you can lost interest quite rapidly.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSIs there money to be made from sports memorabilia?People can be fanatical about their sports, so yes, there is money that can be made from the right sports memorabilia. If you’re looking to get into collecting sports memorabilia for money, then you should make sure that the sports you concentrate on are those that you truly enjoy, otherwise you will lose interest in it quite quickly.Where can I find some good items cheap?Comic books stores or baseball trading shops are some locations that are ideal for finding items of interest for a reasonable price. The more rare an item is, the more expensive it will be.BASEBALL CARD COLLECTINGOne of the most common sports memorabilia items is the baseball card. Kids from all walks of life can often recall the days of their youth when they were collecting baseball cards and trading them with their friends. Ripping open that pack of ten cards with the gum in it was a treat that many kids took for granted.

Sifting through the players one by one, usually flipping past most of them quickly, hoping for that one special card they still needed, elicited a level of excitement that few things in childhood could match.A baseball card is a type of trading card relating to baseball, usually printed on some type of paper stock or card stock. A card will usually feature one or more baseball players or other baseball-related sports figures. Cards are most often found in the United States but are also common in countries such as Canada, Cuba, and Japan, where baseball is a popular sport and there are professional leagues.CONCLUSIONSports memorabilia have been around since the beginning of professional sports and while many of the items that could be worth money have been lost through the years, there are those who take collecting sports memorabilia very seriously. This is a hobby that can be started at any time and with just about any budget.It’s important not to focus on the cost or the rarity of the item, but rather on the significance it has to you. Unless, of course, you plan on making money in the long-term, in which case sports memorabilia collecting would be so much a hobby, but a profession.In any case, knowing what has value and what doesn’t is the important first steps to take before diving in head first and spending way more than you should have for a particular item.",
Tai Chi,"Tai Chi Information Introduction Tai Chi is a meditative exercise that is characterized by slow, lazy movement. However, don’t let that fool you. It has excellent health benefits, assists relaxation and is a self-defense martial art. Tai Chi is therefore regarded as “meditation in motion”. Tai Chi is also known as Tai Chi Chuan, T’ai Chi, Taiji, etc. This ancient Chinese martial art is popular across the globe for its health benefits and relaxing effects, and is increasingly being used as an alternative to the other forms of martial art. 

Martial arts can be divided into two basic categories: the hard martial arts and the soft martial arts, also known as internal arts. Karate and Kung Fu are examples of hard martial arts. Ba Gua and Tai Chi are examples of soft martial arts. The movements in Tai Chi are slow, delicate and flowing and emphasize on force rather than on the brutal movements of the hard martial arts. These flowing, soft and slow movements are executed with precision to attain the right effect. 

Tai Chi is popular in the West, as many people have taken to Tai Chi for its relaxing properties and for its health benefits. The way it is practiced in western countries, it can be best describes as a moving form of meditation and yoga combined; The art is practiced in a number of forms or ‘sets’ that constitute of a sequence of movements. Many of these movements have been derived from the martial arts, and may from the natural world; like the natural movements of birds and animals. The creatures whose movements were copied were the tiger, deer, bear, ape and birds. All the movements are slow and graceful with a smooth transition from one movement to the other. 
History It is difficult to trace the origin of Tai Chi; therefore, one has to rely on legend to know the actual source of this beautiful martial arts form. Tai Chi traces its origin to China in approximately 220 to 265 AD. Yoga was known in China as Saolin chuan (chuan means boxing). Chang San Feng, a Taoist monk, further developed the art of Tai Chi in 13th Century AD. This art form was subsequently associated to different families in China. Each family developed its own form of Tai Chi based on the original form and designated them the family name. 

All other forms of Tai Chi developed from the art developed by the Chen Chang-hsing family (1771-1853). A man called Yang Lu Chan (1789-1872) studied Tai Chi from the Chen family and later developed his own style now known as the Yang style of Tai Chi, and is today the most practiced traditional style of the art. This style of Tai Chi again has three forms that are followed today namely the short form, the long form and the simplified form. 

The Chinese characters of Tai Chi Chuan, translated into English are “Supreme Ultimate Boxing/Force”. This supreme ultimate is the “Tao”, the framework within which in the field of time the dualities (male/female, dark/light, active/passive, forceful/yielding, etc) of Yin and Yang are manifested. Tai Chi within itself, in its movements, patterns of breathing and shapes, contains all that is necessary to bring the forces of Yin and Yang to interact and reconcile to attain the Supreme Ultimate and thus is given such a name. It can be said that originally, Tai Chi Chuan, was a sophisticated method of fighting that brought about the interaction and reconciliation of the two dynamic dual forces. Thus, in this art form, speaking structurally, a practitioner tries to neutralize the force of his opponent and then applying a counter force. In this interaction of give and take, the highest expression or the “supreme ultimate” is found. 

In its developmental stage, Tai Chi was a very potent form of martial art, and was zealously guarded by a few families who used it for self-defense. The techniques of breath control and relaxation, the different and proper postures for transmitting energy, and the methods of single-weightedness were all created with the singular purpose of engaging in combat in a scientifically efficient manner. This aspect of Tai Chi is very important and has to understood and appreciated by every student of Tai Chi, in order to utilize the art to the fullest. All forms of Tai Chi emphasizes on grasping the meaning of the movements and forms 1/3rd of the real purpose of learning Tai Chi. Other purposes of Tai Chi are physical well-being and spiritual, mental and emotional well-being. ‘Push hands’ are also an important part of modern Tai Chi. it is a two person sport and exercise regime in which both the people are sensitive and responsive to other person’s vital force or ‘chi’. 

The Tai Chi philosophy, it is believed, has been taken from the two Chinese philosophical texts, the I Ching and the Tao Te Ching. Tao Te Ching when translated has many meanings; one of which is “the classic way of integrity”. I Ching is a Chinese system of divination. The 13 basic postures of Tai Chi, created by Chang San Feng, are associated with the 5 elements in Chinese alchemy namely fire, water, earth, metal and wood and with the 8 basic I Ching trigrams. Other movements of the art form are also related to the full 64 trigrams of I Ching philosophy. 

Both, I Ching and Tao Te Ching, stress on “chi” that denotes a form of energy. Literally, it means something like “breathe”. “chi” in ancient Greek language meant ‘spirit”. According to Chinese philosophy, ‘chi” flows through an individual’s body. Tai Chi masters, Chinese medicine and Tai Chi philosophy believed that when this energy is blocked one becomes ill. Thus, Tai Chi is also acclaimed to have health benefits as it fosters the circulation of “chi” in a body. This “chi” is circulated in patterns that are closely related to the vascular and nervous system. Thus, Tai Chi is also closely connected to acupuncture and other arts of oriental healing. 

Tai Chi also has meditative benefits. It is said to help a person understand himself/herself thus enabling the person to deal more effectively with others. For this a person needs to self control. This can be attained by the two notions of the Chinese philosophies Tao Te Ching and I Ching. These two notions are Yin and Yang. These two opposite principles merge into one another to create a balance of the outer world and inner self. This in turn brings about a person’s spiritual and physical well-being. Precise execution of Tai Chi exercises fosters a tranquil and calm mind. This provides a person with a practical avenue to learn balance, rhythm of movement, alignment, genesis of movement from various body parts, fine-scale motor control, and more. Practicing Tai Chi thus also helps its practitioner in some measure to stand, walk, run, move, etc in a better way. It also helps to correct poor posture, movement or alignment patterns, etc which might contribute to injury or tension.   
Learning In modern society, we can apply the benefits of Tai Chi in our daily life. In fact, Tai Chi is already very popular in western countries as a hobby sport. This hobby promotes the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical well being of a person and also provides inner calm and tranquility. Tai Chi can be used to fight stress, fatigue, overwork and the lack of understanding of oneself and ones body. Tai Chi, if practiced perfectly, increases one’s longevity and gives you a tool for self-defense should the need ever arise. It also helps in the proper circulation of “chi” in the body keeping you healthy and free from diseases. Practicing Tai Chi daily helps in attaining mental clarity and develops a healthy body. With so many advantages, Tai Chi has become quite popular among the European and western countries. You too can practice Tai Chi as a hobby and later practice till you attain perfection to achieve all-round well being.",
Foosball,"Foosball Information  Introduction Foosball, also commonly known as table soccer or table football, is a widely played game found in schools, pubs, workplaces, and bars that takes the sport of soccer and shrinks it into a table games played for fun. Perhaps you didn’t know what it was, but the chances of you walking past a table at some point in your life is very good. They are more often than not found in dark corners of pool halls, but until recently they have rarely been played in North America. Perhaps the entire sport of soccer is considered second place to sports like hockey, football, and basketball in North America, but in Europe, Foosball is almost as popular as real life soccer. 

Perhaps the appeal to the game is its simplicity that allows virtually anyone of various ages to play the game and actually be good at it. The goal of the game is the same as soccer, which is to score the most goals against an opposing player or, if playing doubles, players. The game allows players to play a fast actions game as both offence and defense for a considerably low price. And just like and game of skill, the more you play the game, the better you will get, and if you get really good, you can compete in the World Championships or other tournaments for substantial cash prizes. 
History of Foosball The history of foosball is a bit tricky when you first set out to learn of its true origins. The game that is generally known as table soccer is believed to have originated Germany in the 1920`s. However, it was also discovered that the French were concocting the exact same game sometime in the early 1930`s. So the actual origins are for the most part are unknown and any information stating its true origins basically nothing more than speculations. IT is also rumored that the concept of table football was created parallel to the actual game of soccer, which is a romantic idea, but probably quite far from the truth. 
Required Equipment For most people who play in pubs, schools, clubs, ect., the only necessity is a pocket full of change. Since Foosball tables are nearly always automated, you simply insert a predetermined amount of change, often between $1 and $2, and you play until all the balls are gone. For new players that have never played the game before, there is one other necessity for playing foosball, and that is patience. Chances are you will not instantly be as good as experienced players, but with time and practice, you can be. 

For those people who need to purchase their own table for home use, there are a couple other items you will want to purchase. The first item is high quality balls from a specialty store that sells game tables, but in most cases the internet will have to be used to find good quality balls. There is nothing wrong with buying cheap plastic balls from Wal-Mart, but this type of ball has no grip on it and tends to break quite easily. Good quality balls are used because they can be gripped by the foosmen on the table, which can then be better manipulated by the player. 

The other item that is almost a necessity is silicone oil that is used to lubricate the metal bars that the foosman are mounted on. Over time, dirt and grime builds up and regular cleaning is needed. TO ensure that the bars glide nicely all the time, small amounts of lubricating oil is added to prevent sticking. Constant sticking can lead to bent wobbly poles that make playing on the table a frustrating experience. 
Purchasing a Table If you have been considering purchasing a table after playing with friends in public places, then there are probably some basic information you will be needing. Foosball tables come in a wide range of prices based on the quality of table, starting around $150 and going on up to $2000 or more for professional tables. If you want a decent table, that will withstand the rigors of play and last for years to come, then you can settle in the $600 to $800 range and be quite happy with a very good table for recreational use. But what exactly makes a table a “good table”? 

The first thing you want to look for is a heavy duty cabinet, one that can withstand harsh play from a large variety of beginner to experienced players. Most tables will come with levels for floors that are not level, which makes a huge difference on the play field. Without a level table, your balls will come to a stop in various spots, or your shots will take strange angles that are inhumanly possible. Good quality foosball men and rods are a must because there is noting more frustrating than replacing smashed foosmen or trying to straighten bend rods. And most importantly, a solid thick play surface with a good laminate will help keep the surface looking like new for many years. Supports under the play surface help to avoid warping and keep the surface flat. 

With these tips in mind while purchasing your foosball table, you will ensure you purchase a foosball table that will last a life time. But always keep in mind that sometime you will find good deals, but for the most part, if a deal is too good then it probably is. And once you have your table, make sure you keep the surface clean, and always make sure to lubricate the rods to eliminate any risk of warping. 
Tips and Tricks Never Spin the Rods because you can hit the ball about as hard as your spin by practicing a wrist shot. There is no way to accurately aim the ball and score when you are just spinning the rods, and you cannot catch balls on defense if you constantly spin the rods. But the most important reason why not to spin the rods is because it actually damages the table by breaking men, loosening pins and screws, and causes the rods to warp. No chocolatear! 

Practice the wrist shot to gain power, speed, and accuracy by placing the ball in front of your three-man attack bar. Lift the defense bar to allow your shots to go into an empty net, and practice hitting the ball as hard as you can straight into the goal. Practice throwing your wrist down in a snapping motion towards the floor past the rod handle, and since your hand is still gripping the handle, your wrist lock preventing a 360 spin of the attack rod. 

Practice aiming your shots as often as you practice making you ball go fast and hard. Set the ball again in front of your three-man attack bar, but this time instead of concentrating on speed, concentrate on the direction you want the ball to move. Depending on where you hit the ball, the ball will travel in different directions. It is ideal to practice this will the defending foosmen all down so you can practice shooting around the players. A majority of players learn to play defense by defend goals straight on, but the simple variance of angles, throws most inexperienced players for a loop. Nothing is more embarrassing and impressive as a shot at ¼ of your normal shooting speed sneaking between a defender’s foosmen. 

Alternate holding techniques like the open hand or fan technique can add substantial speed to any or your shots. These techniques are simple to use as the difference between these and a normal shot is that you keep your hand open. These shots are made by rolling the rod handle in the open palm of your hand. In a way, it is similar to making a 360 spin shot, but you stop the shot before it spins more than 180 degrees. The resulted shot is faster and more powerful than a wrist shot but it does take more time to gain accuracy. 

Fundamentals of Defense begins with yet another reminder not to spin the rods. If the foosmen are not in an upright position, which they are not 80% of the time while spinning, you will not stop any shots. The basic rule of defense is that if you can draw a line from the ball into the goal, your net is considered open. Always stager your defensemen in such a way that the attacker must rely on ball movement or making you flinch to score. In these cases, it is best to loosely grip the rod handles to allow quicker movement when your opponent attempts to race around your defense. If you stack your goalie directly behind your defenseman, you are basically blocking your goalie and leaving all the angle shots wide open. With practice and experience, you will be able to anticipate your opponent’s moves and adjust your defense accordingly. 
Conclusion Foosball is a quickly growing table game of skill that has yet to reach its full potential thus far, but given enough time, foosball will eventually establish itself in North America as it has in Europe. It wasn’t long ago that people ignored the Foosball table to play pool or snooker instead, but younger people, like college students, are discovering foosball and growing its popularity. At one point, the chances of you finding a foosball table in someone’s house was unheard of, but more and more people are purchasing them instead of pool tables because of the considerably smaller size and cost. For those who choose to only play foosball in pubs, bars, ect., the only cost associated with playing the game ranges for $1 to $2 per game. In most places where lots of players are present, the general rule is that if you or a team of two people win a game, you play for free until you are beaten. But in the end, foosball is just like anything else, it takes a lot of practice to be great, but it is fun all the way from beginner to allstar.",
Antiques,"Antiques InformationIntroductionYou can read about the stories from time to time in the news: a person found a historical document at a tag sale for fifty cents that ends up being worth tens of thousands of dollars. Or the individual who finally treks up into the attic to find an old chair that appears to need some work, brings it down to a friend’s shop only to learn that it’s a valuable antique.There’s something to be said about the craftsmanship of an older generation when it comes to furniture, automobiles, and just about anything else that would be considered antique. Antiques at dimension to the design of a room, it adds character, and while many modern manufacturers are stepping into the world of antique recreation, they aren’t true antiques; they don’t have any real history.Antiques attract millions of people because of the history that they carry. Other people once used these antiques, from furniture to sit in, desks to write on, and chests to lug their belongings around in when they emigrated from their homeland to another nation that offered promise and hope.An antique is generally defined as something that is more than seventy-five years old. Automobiles from the fifties and sixties are often mistaken for antiques, but they are only classics. In order to be successful at antique collecting, you need a general knowledge base of time periods, items that were made, sometimes even manufacturers.There are far too many unscrupulous businesses out there that will try to pass off a modern recreation of an antique as an antique and most individuals won’t know about their mistake, or the expense that they incurred unnecessarily paying more for an item they believe was a true antique.By knowing what to look for in an antique, and by knowing the right people to ask, since it is almost impossible to know everything about every antique ever made, you put yourself in a position that will protect you from making a poor purchase choice.There are many people who don’t understand the appeal of antique collecting and drive past the rows and rows of antique shops in certain towns and never take a moment to step inside and feel the history that surrounds them. Most of the true antiques that one will find in shops, online, or by luck while passing through a tag sale, were once used by people who have long since passed from this mortal coil.Antiques help to keep history alive and in some small way, they help to carry on the memories of those who have gone before us. If you have never stepped into the world of antique collecting, and you’re ready to begin, then you’ve come to the right place.First Steps in Antique CollectingThe first steps in any new venture can sometimes be the most nervous and troubling. In antique collecting, the first steps, if not taken with care, can cost money. When you’re ready to begin collecting antiques, it’s a good idea to align yourself with people who share that same interest.Look in the local newspaper or go online and try to find groups of antique collectors who share stories, refer others to special deals, and basically look out for the interests of their members and keep an eye out for the things that the members might be looking for.You can learn a great deal from local antique shop owners. Weekends are not the best time to approach them as a beginner, since this is generally their busiest time of the week when their customers are off from work and cruising around looking for the best deals. Instead, call ahead and let them know that you’re new to antique collecting and would like to ask some questions. They will likely be more than willing to walk you through a few steps first and will most likely ask you to come over during the mid-week period, when business is at its slowest.The next thing to do is purchase some books on antique collecting and read. Read, read, read. The more you read, the more you will learn about manufacturers, styles, woods (for furniture), metals and craftsmanship used to forge certain items, and just about anything else under the sun that you could want to know about antiques.There are hundreds of books on antique collecting, and while you don’t need to read them all, you should focus on what most other antique collectors consider to be the most important and more well written. Ask the groups that you find as well as the shop owners for some advice.The more you read, the more comfortable you will be with the terms used, the periods mentioned, as well as what makes one antique more valuable than another. Sometimes the natural wear of an item is what gives it more value than something that looks as though it just came out of the wood shop. Other items will only be considered truly valuable if they look pristine.Then there’s the manner of the reconditioning of the item, if any work has been done to it. Modern varnishes and lacquers can actually diminish the value of an antique if not applied properly, or if the wrong finish is used. Some items will be missing important features that make the antique valuable. If you don’t know about the things to look for, you could end up on the losing end of a deal you thought was great.Placing Personal Value on AntiquesNot every antique that you come across will necessarily have to have some serious monetary value to be worth something. People find antiques every day that speak to them on a personal level. It could be something as simple as a jewelry case that reminds them of their grandmother, or their mother. They could find a pocket watch that is identical to a photograph of their great grandfather when he first arrived in his new country.When you start shopping around for antiques, you will undoubtedly find numerous items that remind you of something or someone you once knew. Even smells can inspire the desire to want to own an item. The smell of mothballs in the attic can make millions of people think about visits to their grandparents’ home and produce a longing, a nostalgic yearning for those days that are long gone.Don’t begin an antique collection solely based on the merits of financial gain or aesthetic appearance. Whether you’re looking for furniture or small jewelry items, or quills for writing, there should be some items that you find that aren’t necessarily valuable financially, but that touch you in some deep and personal way.When you begin your journey into antique collection, look for the small items, appreciate the history that they offer. It may not have anything to do with your direct personal history or even that of your family’s history, but when you browse through all of these incredible items, you are browsing through someone’s history.The First TripWhen you’re ready to take your first trip out antiquing, as it is commonly called, there are some things to keep in mind. The first is that, if you’re serious about antique collecting as a long-term hobby, then you should consider leaving your wallet, or your purse, home. It wouldn’t hurt, either to abandoned the pickup truck or the SUV that would make purchasing an item easier to get home.The reason for this is that when you begin any adventure that you have never done before, it can be exciting and exhilarating and you could be tempted to do things you might not otherwise have done.Think about this for a moment, if you would. When was the last time you were excited about an activity, you couldn’t wait to begin it, and your exuberance was so strong that you went out there and suddenly realized that you were in over your head or that you simply didn’t make the right decisions. When you are trying something new, or when you’re heading out with a full bank account and looking to start your collection post haste, you can make mistakes, poor choices, and these can hurt your chances of having a truly rewarding and lasting hobby, or passion, for years to come.Yes, beginning something new can be quite a feeling and something that you just want to dive into, but without some level of rational thought throughout the process, you will find that you will make mistakes.Make your first trip out to antique stores, especially on the weekend, about soaking in the atmosphere. You should step back and watch how other people act and react to certain specials or particular items. Allow their frenzy to consume them. If you do this long enough on your first trip, especially when you do so during the busiest times, you will see a lot of people act quite foolish and impulsive.You will see poor decisions being made and people paying far more for an item than they should. Remember, this could be you, if you’re not careful, if you don’t use a little common sense and an ounce of restraint.When you step back at first, you will have a better grasp of what you want and a better poise to be ready to negotiate the price.Negotiating PriceAntique collecting is about finding the best items and getting them for the best price. Antique dealers know what the value of their items are and they also understand that many of their customers are also frugal and understand the value of the items. There is generally some leeway in the price and you shouldn’t consider paying full price for the item.Remember one thing about antiques –they were not built recently. These items were made many years ago, and price and value are somewhat subjective. The antique dealers want to make the most profit for their items, but that doesn’t mean that they are going to turn down a reasonable offer.Reasonable can mean many things to many people. If you walk into an antique store, find something you want, and offer half price for it, you’re not being reasonable. If you took off ten or fifteen percent and made that offer, you’re being reasonable. An antique dealer can either say yes, no, or counter with another offer.Remember, you’re the customer. You don’t have to purchase anything you don’t want to. Discuss the price and if the dealer isn’t willing to negotiate, you can either pay the asking price or move on. It doesn’t hurt to ask.Frequently Asked QuestionsI have no clue whether an item is antique or not. What do I do?If you own an item that may be an antique, bring it to an antique store near you. If you found an item that you like and want to verify that it’s an antique, bring along someone who knows and have them evaluate it.Do antiques appreciate in value over time?That all depends on the item, how many were made, the condition, and a number of other factors.Can antiques be items other than furniture?Most laypersons think of antiques as being furniture only. This is far from the truth. Antiques can be anything that was created, made, or built more than seventy-five years ago.There’s an item that I really like, but I just don’t know if it’s an antique. How can I tell?There are many items out there that are being passed off as antiques, when they are anything but. The only true way to protect yourself from being misled is to educate yourself on antiques. It’s also a great idea to befriend antiquing groups in your area and ask questions.Never hesitate to ask questions. Most collectors who have a passion for antiques will be more than happy to answer them.ConclusionAntique collecting isn’t for everyone. It is an acquired passion that can lead someone to stumble across a treasure, whether that value is measured in dollars and cents or simply and aesthetic or personal one. It can be difficult to convince others who don’t know anything about antique collecting just what the attraction is all about, but if you’ve caught the bug, make sure that you surround yourself with people who share that passion for antiques that you’re beginning to develop.The quickest way to destroy a fledgling passion is to be surrounded by people who simply don’t understand it.",

Amateur Geology,"Amateur Geology InformationINTRODUCTIONThe hobby of amateur geology, often referred to as rockhounding, goes back quite a far way into the past, but the hobby became the most popular during the years when prospectors began looking for valuable minerals and gemstones for commercial purposes. Although the initial impulse to join the hobby was for financial gain, the reasons have grown considerably since those early days. Although financial gain is always in the minds of those seeking the literal treasures of gems and minerals, more and more people seem to have been drawn to amateur geology for recreational purposes and for the beauty that rocks and minerals provide. It’s also safe to say that the hobby has expanded considerably since the days of gems and minerals because people are now very interested in fossils for the same reason they were seeking gems and minerals.The main reason for the rise in popularity of amateur geology is that a collection can begin by simply picking up a rock. It doesn’t have to be a diamond or a ruby to be something beautiful and even the smallest can tell the entire history of your home town. Avid rock collectors often use their specimens to learn about petrology, mineralogy and geology as well as skills in the identification and classifying of specimen rocks, and preparing them for display. The hobby can lead naturally into lapidary projects, and also the cutting, polishing, and mounting of gemstones and minerals. The equipment needed to do this includes rock saws and polishers. Many beautiful crystal varieties are typically found in very small samples, which require a good microscope for working with and photographing the specimen. The hobby can be as simple as finding pretty rocks for a windowsill or develop into a detailed and comprehensive museum quality display. There are also many clubs and groups that search for specimens and compare them in a group setting. Information on where to find such groups can be found at libraries, bookstores, and ""gem and mineral shows"". Tourist information centers and small-town chambers of commerce can also supply valuable local information, but the internet is perhaps the greatest tool in discovering the hobby of amateur geology.REQUIRED EQUIPMENTThe great thing about rockhounding is that most people typically start collecting without realizing that they are actually participating in a hobby. Most people will just see a cool rock on the ground and pick it up because it looks nice and they just want to keep it. The fact is, for amateur geologists, it is quite typical to go into the field with little more than perseverance and the best intentions. But then you realize that hunting for rocks is pretty fun, but what exactly are these rocks that you keep collecting. The first, and perhaps simplest, equipment that all rockhounders should carry at all times is a notepad and a pencil. This is simply to write down the date, the place, and commentaries on the excursion and the mineral samples that we have found. It is recommendable to number each of the found samples, as well as to make a card where we will indicate which mineral is and which are their more interesting characteristics. Plus to see these characteristics, especially the smallest identifying factors, a magnifying glass is a fantastic tool that will make those smaller details easier to see, which will make the identification of certain minerals possible.For the collection of the samples we will need a newspaper in order to surround the units and thus to avoid that they are deteriorated and they spoil. A geologist hammer, or a hammer and a cold chisel or rock chisel, is absolutely essential when you have to break a rock apart to obtain the mineral samples that are wanted to gather. With safety being as important as it is, it is quite important to wear protective goggles to protect the eyes of those possible little fragments that take place when the rocks are broken with the hammer. Trust me, there is nothing worse than having something stuck in your eye. Gloves are another easy safety precaution in order to avoid injuring your hands when manipulating rocks. It’s actually a little silly, but a backpack to load and to take all the tools and the mineral samples found is nice to have because the second you don’t have one is the time you end up carrying pockets of precious rocks for long hikes.If your search of samples is not simply a hike in search for gems, minerals, fossils ect., but rather a trip into a type of cave or mine that is underground, then we should have certain considerations for safety. Obviously, the first major considerations is to not to go alone. You should always go accompanied into an underground area, and it is being recommendable that the entire group doesn’t enter into the mine at the same time, as it is important that somebody remain waiting outside. The mines that are not in operation are used to undergoing a serious deterioration and in some cases a real risk of collapse can exist, is due to carry far the precautions to the maximum.For the mineral search within a mine we will need a helmet above all else in order to protect the head of possible landslides, blows with the ceiling of the mine, and other such possible dangers. A lantern will be essential to be able to see and to be able to advance in the penumbra of the mine. To kill two birds with one stone, it is recommended to use a helmet light because it allows the hands to be free at all times plus, the light will always illuminate just in the point where we are glancing at.WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THESE ROCKSThere are a few technical terms advanced pebble puppies need to add to their vocabulary before they decide what to do with their collections. The first one is Trashite, second is Leaverite, and the last is High Grade. The first term “trashite” is a mineral specimen of no absolutely no value. Trashite should always be left at the collecting site without even a second look back, which will make sure it will never interfere with your collection. Leaverite, used as a noun or a verb, means ""leave it right where you found it"". It is also a specimen you don`t need to waste your time on, but let someone else take it home to their waste pile. High grade is a verb, meaning pick over your collection with a critical eye and select the best pieces, while giving away, selling, swapping, etc. your lesser pieces. High grading is a good practice at the collecting site, too. It prevents you from having piles of Trashite and Leaverite around your yard. As your collection grows, aim for quality, instead of quantity. Your significant others will appreciate it, and you will feel better about your collection that will constantly grow in quality. This also implies that you should display your best pieces, and keep your less attractive pieces put away for safe keeping.Specimens are also organized, traded, and sold in units called ""beer flats"". A beer flat is the two-inch tall cardboard box that is discarded after the six-packs have been stocked in the store. The boxes are about 11"" x 17"" and are ideal for storing all but the largest of your extra specimens. These boxes are so standardized and accepted among rock collectors that you can purchase fold up white paper boxes of various standard sizes that fit into the beer flats. This also leads up to the discussion of the several sizes recognized for collectable specimens. Size counts when you are deciding what and how to collect. If you have unlimited space, you can collect any size you want. The rest of us, however, with limited space, must seriously consider the size of what we collect. In the space that you can keep and display 50 hand specimens, you would be able to keep and display 1000 thumbnail specimens. The various sizes range from Thumbnail, Miniature, Hand, and Cabinet specimens.Cleaning the rocks you find may be one of the most important and rewarding aspect of the entire hobby. Since the end result of collecting various types of rock is to display them, it only makes sense that your specimens are clean, bright, and shining when you decide to finally show them off. When it comes to different types of minerals found in mines and quarries, they are usually dirty or covered of clays or oxides that disfigure the specimen. It is also common to find minerals covered with layers or mineralization of calcite, quartz or other that we wished to eliminate to obtain the mineral that really interests to us. The suitable method to clean minerals happens to be to submerge them in some type of solution that eliminates these undesired substances either by simply cleaning in clear water, or water mixed with some acid type. Note that the use of acids is extremely dangerous and their use should only be by someone who is trained to do so. The other process is through Rock polishing, which is a lapidary process whereby rough stone is polished and smoothed using simple machines to produce attractive stones often used in jewelry. The most common means is tumble polishing, but there is also vibratory finishing.CONCLUSIONAlthough amateur Geology is a great hobby to get into, and perhaps one of the easiest to get into, it is also one hobby that requires a fair bit of research as you gain more experience. There is actually a big difference between going out and picking up rocks compared to planning a trip to find specific types of rocks. Although it is amateur, it is still geology at its heart, and the ultimate goal within the hobby to learn geology on a smaller scale than someone who goes through a university program to study geology. The fact of the matter is that finding a certain gem, mineral, or fossil is just the start of the hobby because once you get your specimen home, then your real job begins. Once home, the goal is to ultimately determine what it is that you have and the best way to showcase your find. A geode for example is a find that many people dream of because Geodes are essentially rock cavities or vugs with internal crystal formations or concentric banding. The neat thing about geodes is that they look like normal rocks on the outside, but the insides are full of gorgeous crystals. I live in an area where fossils are common if you look hard enough, and their quite frankly isn’t anything more amazing than cracking a rock open to find fossilized materials. On top of everything else, rockhounding is a great way to stay active and see the great outdoors. So not only are you doing something that is a great interest to you, but it is also a great part of a healthy lifestyle.",

Floristry,"Floristry InformationINTRODUCTIONFlowers and plants have become a part of every culture in the world. The role that flowers now play in beautifying our homes and gardens dates back to the earliest of civilizations throughout our history. There is no clear record on when flowers were grown strictly for arrangements, but it was likely when the first agrarian societies developed, well before formal recorded history. The first formal recognition of floral design and arrangements was recorded by the Ancient Egyptians that selected specific flowers during burial ceremonies and for their relationship to specific deities and Gods. Other cultures continued this practice with flowers as well as foliage and herbs used to ward off evil and to provide protection. The Asian cultures used flowers for their artistic and esthetic value as well as for medicinal purposes.With this formal adaption of the art of flower arrangements, greater emphasis was placed on growing flowers and increasing the length of time that the flowers were available. Over time indoor and greenhouse cultivation of even the most exotic of flowers became more and more common, allowing a much greater choice for professional and hobby florists alike.Now, the floral industry is a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide. Exotic cut flowers are flown around the world with most florists able to order any type of flower required to complete that perfect arrangement. Floral arrangements are a part of almost every celebration from festive holidays to weddings and funerals.While going to a professional florist for your centerpieces and arrangements is always an option, creating your own unique floral pieces is a way to create a unique piece of living art. You can also combine floral arrangement with floral gardening, growing the seasonal or year round flowers that you want to use yourself. This may be a bit more costly, especially if you are contemplating a greenhouse, but it is an extremely rewarding and satisfying addition the floral arrangement hobby. Learning about flower arranging is something that can be done via classes, books or online learning, and it is an art form that anyone can practice and develop. Getting started is very low cost and the entire family can join in, making beautiful arrangements that may even transition from a hobby to a business.STYLES OF FLORAL ARRANGEMENTThere are many different types of floral arrangements from the massive and elaborate arrangements popular in many Western cultures through to the very minimal arrangements of more Eastern cultures. Perhaps one of the countries most associated with the elegant and minimal type of design is Japan. Often the floral arrangement is seen as a part of the Tea Ceremony but it is also developed as a way to beautify the home and workplace environment. Living plants and cut flowers are most common in traditional Japanese arrangements, and typically seasonal plants and flowers are the only acceptable materials used in traditional arrangements.MEANING OF FLOWERSIn the Victorian era, which is the time that Queen Victoria ruled in England, extended from 1873 to 1901, there was a great deal of cultural change. During this time artists flourished and, with increasing industrialization and availability of time, money and imported goods, many people found that they could turn to more artistic and literary pursuits than they had been able to afford in the past. This is a time when the Victorian style of floral arrangements really took off, including the famous style of Victorian gardening still very much in vogue today.It was during this time that people sought to see meaning in all aspects of life, so having a flower type mean a specific sentiment, emotion or message just made sense. There were limited types of flower that were used in arrangements because they had to be locally grown. By knowing the meaning of the flowers you could interpret the meaning of the arrangement. While not as essential now, many people still use the traditional association of an emotion with a flower, which helps to determine what flowers can be used in a specific type of arrangement. The most common flowers and their associated means are listed below:Amaryllis – dramaAnemone – fragilityAzalea – abundanceBaby`s Breath – festivityBachelor Button – anticipationBlack-eyed Susan – encouragementCamellia – graciousnessDaffodil – chivalryDaisy – innocenceGeranium – comfortHydrangea – perseveranceIris – inspirationLavender – distrustLilac – first loveMarigold – desire for richesNasturtium – patriotismPeony – healingPoppy – consolationOrchid – delicate beautyPansy – loving thoughtsSunflower – adoration In addition there are several flowers that have different meanings based on their colors. These include carnations, roses, tulips and chrysanthemum. The colors and the corresponding flower are often used as the central part of the message or arrangement with complimentary flowers to enhance the meaning. For example, A white carnation is a sign of remembrance and can be used in an arrangement with red and white roses that can signify love and unity.While the meanings of flowers in this form is a fun way to add to a floral arrangement there are also more traditional flowers associated with different events. All months have a flower that is considered the birth month flower, similar to a birthstone or a zodiac sign. The following are the traditional and alternative options for the birth month flowers:January – carnationFebruary – iris, violetMarch – daffodilApril – daisy, peonyMay – liliesJune – roseJuly – delphiniumAugust – dahlia, gladiolusSeptember – aster, forget-me-notOctober – MarigoldNovember – chrysanthemumDecember – poinsettia, narcissus, holly, paperwhite As you can see most of the birth month flowers are naturally blooming during that period of time. There are also few exotic flowers in the traditional list but there are some very beautiful modern alternatives that have been added as more and more international shipping of cut flowers is possible.Flowers can also have cultural meanings and may be deemed to be more or less acceptable in arrangements for special events in each culture. Colors of flowers can also be important, especially for some of the Asian and Middle Eastern cultures. For example a traditional Mexican holiday, The Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos), is most commonly associated with marigolds, usually in bright yellow, red and orange combinations. These flowers are not only strikingly rich in color but they are also excellent cut flowers as they last for a long period of time.Chinese weddings typically include a lot of red flowers since red is the symbol of life and happiness within the culture. White flowers, which are common in many Western styles of wedding bouquets and centerpieces are avoided since white is colored the color of death. In the Indian wedding the flowers that are most often used in ceremonies and arrangements include marigolds, jasmine, orchids and roses, often used in very beautiful combinations both for the bridal party as well as to decorate the reception area.Peonies are often considered a traditional flower of Chinese cultural events and special celebrations. Cherry blossoms, particularly in spring arrangements, are a hallmark of Japanese cultural events. Orange blossoms are very traditionally use in floral arrangements in the Middle East and are also used in cooking. The Lotus flower is often seen as a powerful symbol in Buddhist religion and represents the four virtues, which is why it is often used in wedding arrangements in Asian cultures.TRAINING AND CLASSESFloral arrangement and floral art is a hobby that can be very low cost to start, especially if you have your own supply of fresh flowers.

Watch Collecting,"Watch Collecting InformationINTRODUCTIONKeeping time is one of those ancient traditions that has taken on new meaning in the modern age of fast food, fast meetings, and telecommuting. People seem to check their watches on a regular basis, so that they are certain not to miss an important date, meeting, or some other event.Time is precious and mankind has been tracking and keeping time for thousands of years. From to ancient Mayans who used a complex formula to maintain a calendar that has more significance now, as we approach the year 2012, than in the past five hundred years, to the Anglicans in England who built Stonehenge with a precision alignment of the sun and moon and stars.While these two examples aren’t watches or clocks, they highlight mankind’s fascination with the technology that goes into watches and clocks. Big Ben is one of the world’s most well-known clocks and Rolex is one of the most universally recognized wrist watch manufacturers in the world, though certainly not the most expensive,Watch collecting for some people is a hobby that presents a number of opportunities, as well as challenges. Knowing watch history, manufacturing, and periods is important to discovering the great find at a tag or garage sale, and ending up with what looked like an ancient watch only to learn that it was just an imitation, a remake from a modern manufacturer.Watches come in all shapes and sizes, just as clocks do. What can be exciting for any watch collector is discovering the jewel in a sea of the ordinary. Whether it’s a pocket watch from the time of Lincoln to a wrist watch that made it into space, there are gems located around the world just waiting to be discovered.Watch collecting can be compared to many other collecting hobbies, such as stamp collecting and coin collecting, to name just a couple. If you are interested in watch collecting, then there’s no better time to start than right now. As far as hobbies are concerned, watch collecting is a timeless and fulfilling one that can last a lifetime.AN OVERVIEW OF WATCH COLLECTINGThere are a number of groups that gather to discuss watch collecting, to trade secrets, and to simply enjoy the company of other people who share a common interest. While a majority of individuals don’t understand the appeal of watch collecting, those who have been bitten by the bug know what it can offer.Watches are the time keepers for society. Mankind could certainly survive without watches, as it had for thousands of years, but the idea of the watch has made life much simpler, and more complicated at the same time. Without watches, men and women are subjected to averages, meaning meetings would take place in the morning or the afternoon, hopefully close to the right time.Watches have changed through the years, moving from strictly analog (using the minute, second, and hour hands) to digital and then combining the two. Some watches incorporated a calculator for use by technical engineer types. Other watches offered the ability to know what time it was in different parts of the world while still others became capable of being submerged underwater.Now there are dive watches that scuba divers use to tell time, measure depth, and air levels in a tank. There are aviation watches and naval watches. There are watches that track the constellations in the sky and even watches that will offer the latest headline news across a screen whenever something comes up. Watches can also be used to track the stock market, from anywhere in the world.Watches have come a long way from the days of pocket watches attached to a chain and kept in the vest pocket of a wealthy man. Is time really all that important? Or is the fascination with time keeping and watches something that has evolved over time, changed with changing times, and ultimately led to the current fascination with it? That answer can only be arrived at by understanding the history of watches.TYPES OF WATCHESA movement in watchmaking is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month and day).Mechanical MovementsCompared to electronic movements, mechanical watches are less accurate, often with errors of seconds per day, and they are sensitive to position and temperature. Mechanical movements also use a balance wheel together with the balance spring (also known as a hairspring) to control motion of the gear system of the watch in a manner analogous to the pendulum of a pendulum clock.Electronic MovementsElectronic movements have few or no moving parts, as they use the piezoelectric effect in a tiny quartz crystal to provide a stable time base for a mostly electronic movement. Electronic watches are often called quartz watches. Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch in order to provide a traditional analog display of the time.GETTING STARTED: FINDING THE RIGHT SUPPORTWhen you’re ready to begin your watch collecting hobby, one of the first things that you should do is to seek out a group of like-minded individuals who share your passion for watches. Watch collecting is a popular hobby, especially in this modern age of technology and a sense of losing some measure of history.There are a number of ways that you can set out to find a group with whom to share your interest, ask questions and, ultimately, offer guidance when you are at that place when you have more knowledge than other people around you. Since there is an enormous amount of information to know and understand when it comes to watches, wading through the waters by yourself is not necessarily the best idea.Using the Internet, you can join any number of watch aficionado groups throughout the world, sharing your passion with people whom you might never otherwise have met. The Internet has offered hobbyists of all types the opportunity that our fathers and forefathers could never have dreamt about.Get online and begin searching for groups within your are first and then for groups around the world.WHAT YOU NEED TO GET STARTED

PassionFirst and foremost, you need passion. If you don’t have a passion to learn about watches, then watch collecting is not going to last long for you and in all likelihood, you will end up wasting your time in the long run. For those individuals who plan to collect watches for the sake of profitability, there will still need to be a great deal of research conducted on your part and while it may seem as though you are going to find some diamonds in the rough, so to speak, odds are you will lose interest long before you stumble across that great find.Watches have history, as you may have read earlier and as such, they have a lot to teach us about how time is kept, managed, and even structured. The efficiency of a quality watch is something to behold, so make sure that before anything else, you have a passion for watch collecting.KnowledgeBefore you head out and purchase your first watch to add to your collection, you need knowledge about what you’re planning to buy. Do you understand the most basic difference between analog and digital? Between functional and dress watches? How about some of the most general terms, such as the crown, the dial, bezel, and even movement?If you don’t then you will likely stumble into an unnecessary quagmire of questions and while a good support group will be more than happy to help you move through this passion for watch collecting, many will grow wearing of doing the heavy lifting when it comes to learning and research for you.Educate yourself on the basics. Here is a brief rundown of the most important concepts to watches and watch collecting:Crown The crown is a protrusion from the side of an analog watch that is usually situation in the three o’clock position, and is used to wind the watch and to set the time.BezelThe bezel is basically the metal surface of the watch that allows the person to quickly read the time. Some watches do not have a bezel and instead the individual must decipher the time from the basic hand positions.DialThis is also referred to as the face of the watch and is the main focal point of the watch. The brand of the watch, the numbers or notches for the hour and minute hands, and some other information is generally located on the dial.MovementThis is the term for the mechanical device that powers the watch. Analog watches consist of winding mechanisms, balance wheels, and a mainspring and escapement. These produce power and move the hands around to tell the time.
The more you know learn about watches early on in your watch collecting hobby, the easier time you will have in locating quality watches and starting your collection.ResourcesWhile some people will immediately assume that resources means money, this isn’t necessarily the case.

Washing windows or taking care of the lawn are simple services that elderly individuals may enjoy having done for them who might also have that precious watch you’re interested in.A Starting PointWhenever we begin a new hobby, it’s important to have a starting point and reasonable expectations. Don’t jump into watch collecting expecting to find a Rolex at a garage sale or a historically significant pocket watch worn by one of the presidents of the United States.Think small and reasonable. You can find a number of wonderful antique watches at antique shops. While some of these watches may be expensive, there are also great deals to be found.ExperimentIf you want to truly invest your time and money and effort into watch collecting, then you can consider purchasing a few cheap watches and dissecting them to see how they work from the inside. This will give you great insight into watch mechanics and what to look for when buying watches for your collection.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSI don’t have any watches. What should I purchase first?It doesn’t matter if you have any watches when you set out to begin watch collecting.

Kitesurfing,"Kitesurfing Information  Introduction Kitesurfing is a sport that takes place on the surface of the water. The rider is pulled through on the surface of water by a kite board or surfboard, with the power of the wind using kites. Kitesurfing is thus also known as kite boarding. The terms are used interchangeably. 

The kites, which are used for doing kitesurfing, are very large and called as power kites. The board, which supports the surfer, does not have any bindings or straps. Holding onto the kite, which can be controlled, the rider is propelled forward on water surface. 

Over past few years, kitesurfing has gained a lot of popularity partly due to the reason that the basics of kitesurfing can be learned easily as well as the ease of transporting the necessary equipment but it is a difficult skill to master. A lot of practice as well as control is required, in addition to care since the sport is quite dangerous and can cause serious injury. Keeping in mind the dangers involved, safety instructions, innovations in designing of kite as well as safety systems have been incorporated to make this sport much safer. 

There are also different styles that a rider can do depending on the conditions and the rider’s comfort level. These can be freestyle, jumping, wake style, cruising and wave riding. 
Guidelines for the beginners 1. Find a Trainer Kite: 

In order to learn kite surfing within no time this step is considered being the most important. Instructor kites are much simpler and smaller in size as compared to actual kites. You are taught on ground for much time before practicing it on the water. It is very difficult to control the board on water so make it easier the training is done on ground. These training kites are mostly two foil line and they have various sizes ranging from one to three meters. It is better to opt for such kite whose size is 3 meter. The good about these trainer kites is that they provides or ensures you with the basic know how about controlling the kite against wind. It is very important to have complete control over this trainer power kite before going for big kites. Moreover it is very cost effective way to start off.
  2. Build up your Board expertise 

Sports for instance skate boarding, surfing and wakeboarding improves or add a lot to your kite surfing skills. If you are an expert in any of this game then you can learn kitesurfing with in no time. There are number of ways to boost your surfing speed surfing i.e. technique and board you use. 

3- Consult an expert (critical step) 

By having an expert for your guidance you can learn how to kite surf with perfection. Your instructor will correct you if you are doing something wrong in the best way. Lesson you will take from your trainer will not make you to learn in less time, but he or she will ensure you won’t face an accident because of practicing it wrong. 

4- Get yourself proper equipped before going for it: 

Every physical sport can lead to severe injuries if not done with proper care. So make sure you are well equipped before you go for kitesurfing. Mishap can happen anywhere resulting in injuries. Why not to protect from various injuries. So make sure you have pads, gloves, helmet and other useful equipment on you while surfing. 
Types of boards used for kitesurfing: Kitesurfing can be done by four different types of boards which are as follows: 

1- Skim- type board 2- Wake board 3- Hybrid board 4- Directional board   Skim-type board: 

It is not the choice of people anymore, so you will see rest of the three boards with all those who are doing kitesurfing.   Directional board or surf style (directional) board: 

It is just like a surfboard. It consists of three or two handles for keels and feet, similar to what we have in surfboard. 

Advantages: The size of these boards are very large, they have better stability, where it makes easy for us to use in bad winds. They can be the best choice if you want to surf on waves. Due to the presence of rabeta and nose with keels, they are considered as the best for long (high) jumps. 

Disadvantage: In case of heavy winds these boards are very much difficult to use at the corners of water. 

Hybrid board: 

These boards are also known as bi directional boards. They have two handles still they are compatible with sandals and with boots used in water boards. In these board both the surface are of same kind. So any side can be use to do surfing. It is mainly the choice of those who are the beginners of kitesurfing. 

Advantages: The main advantages of this type of board are that until or unless they are not directed to change the direction they will never change its direction. 

Disadvantages: In normal winds they can be used else it is very difficult to handle them. 

Style board or Wakeboard: 

They don’t have kneel and are very small in size. Mainly they have boots but some wakeboards still have sandals. 

Advantages: Turning and jumping is very much easy from these boards as they have small and light weight. Moreover, one can hold in edge of water in strong wind. 

Disadvantages: As they need high winds thus floating is not possible. In case of weak or bad wind, staying up is very much difficult. If kites falls while surfing in water the athlete can’t swim as his feet’s are tight up with boots. Going into water with boots is not a child play. 
Techniques Spinning or Turning: For a beginner the most difficult thing is to “turn”. If you are a beginner you should learn how successfully turn. To turn successfully, a beginner should first stop, and then sink backwards into Water. After this he should turn the kite in opposite direction and start again. For the one who is practicing the simple turn from much time can make a change to its turn via “heel turn jibe”. It is an effective way of turning which can be done by first reducing the speed and board flattening. After this the board flat is reversed on water which can be done by bringing around downwind the rear foot and making it your new leading foot. This reverses the kite direction and swings the path of the surfer in half circle. With the turn ended, the kite is again flying in front of the surfer. 

Care must be taken when turning in high winds because the pressure can easily swing the surfer off into the air resulting in an injury. 

Jumping and flying with perfection: 

Controlled flying is known to be a great adventure of kitesurfing. When kite is on your head, you can then perform many aerobatic. One thing that should never be put away from mind about kitesurfing is that it is an extreme dangerous sport. Tension has to be built in the board and kite by accelerating it before you jump so that you are able to catch perfect momentum. As you start off, your chest face immense strong wind and kite drag force can easily cause dislocation of muscles if not done with proper care. So it is very much recommended to consult an expert for your guidance otherwise practicing at your own will only cause injuries. Your instructor can ensure how to do this technique with 100% perfection. 

Grab technique: 

Before going for grab technique one has to be an expert of jumping technique. Until and unless you are not a good jumping athlete you can’t perform grab technique. The person who is performing this technique should know how to land on water after jump with perfection. 

Following are the steps that are needed to perform grab technique: 

1- Jump the way you do on normal basis 2- Take off your hands from the bar while you are in the air. 3- Hold the edge of the board from that hand which you take off from the bar. 4- For landing on water take your hand off from edge and land on water the way you land on normal days. 
Tips Here are some beginner’s tips which you may find quite useful: 

• Always inflate your kite by laying it out completely. This will keep it safe from bladder twisting inside the sheath. • When rolling up the kite, don’t roll it the same way. This can cause stretching of material which can change the flying characteristics over the time. • It is recommended that a small kite should be used by beginner as compared to an experienced one. • You should check the weather conditions before kitesurfing. If storm is coming don’t go for surfing. • Always keep a hook knife with you. You may entangle yourself and may be unable to free yourself. For this you will have to cut the flying line, which can be done using hook knife. Otherwise without the hook knife, you may cut your fingers while freeing. • When folding the inflated kite, first fold it from one end to the middle and then fold the other end to the middle. • Make sure when you deflate, you close the valve. This will block the sand from blowing in. • Deflating the bladders can be done using a pump. Most of the pumps work in reverse as well. • You should periodically check the length of lines. Over time the kite lines stretch and so new lines needs to be pre-stretched when you buy on spool. • In order to find a leak in bladder, you should pump it after removing bladder. After this, spread some water solution which is soapy over bladder and find the spot where it bubbles. Repair this spot where leakage is present.

Running,"Running Information Intro Running is a both a sport which can take many forms, and a great way to get in shape. 

What does ‘running’ actually mean? Running is defined in sporting terms as a gait in which at some point all feet are off the ground at the same time. This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from a slow jog to all-out sprinting. 
Equipment
Shoes One of the great aspects of running is that it doesn’t require a large investment in equipment to get started. One area where you shouldn’t skimp though is your running shoes. Good shoes, correctly fitted, will make running more comfortable, and are your most valuable tool in preventing injuries. 

Visit a specialist running store, with trained professionals that can help find the right shoes for you. Go dressed to run, as they will want to watch you run, and may have equipment to measure and map your personal running style, and your ‘biomechanics’, or how your foot moves during each running stride. 

There are many different shoes for different purposes, but to get started, expect to spend about $100 on a good quality pair of general running shoes. If you can afford it, it’s a good idea to get two pairs, and alternate them between runs. This lets the shoes dry out and the fabrics and materials ‘rest’ and reshape between runs. If you run every day, two pairs are essential. Keep a record of your running, because you will need to replace your shoes at least every 500 miles.  
Socks Inside your shoes, you need a good pair of socks. Your running stride will be able to help you find the right socks, but specialist running socks are designed to prevent blisters, reduce heat and sweating, and last frequent washes and hard wear. They may cost more than regular gym socks, but they will last longer, and they will certainly make your running more comfortable.  
Clothing You don’t need expensive high-tech running clothes to get started, but a good pair of shorts, leggings, or sweat pants that doesn’t chafe is important. There are many ‘technical’ fabrics available today that aren’t expensive, and will keep you dry and chafe free. Find a style that is comfortable and that you like. 

Eventually, if you become competitive or really want to increase your running, compression clothing is a good investment. These garments fit very snugly, and help to improve circulation. This gives you more endurance while you run, and prevents injury. Wearing compression clothing after running can speed up recovery too, but it is more expensive than standard running garments, and by its tight-fitting nature, it isn’t always comfortable.  
Gyms and equipment You can run just about anywhere, so you don’t need an expensive gym membership to get started. However, if you really want to run a lot, if you don’t have a lot of time, or you don’t want to run in the dark or in bad weather, a gym can give you some more options. Many gyms have indoor tracks, and pretty much all have treadmills. 

Running on a treadmill is different from running on the road. Start slowly, until you get used to the movement, and be careful to change speed and incline slowly. Once you get used to them, treadmills can be very useful. They often have cushioned surfaces to prevent injuries, and although you can set them to run uphill, you don’t ever run downhill, which is where many injuries occur. If you are serious about your running, you may even want to invest in a treadmill at home for the long winter months! 
Coaching and clubs You can get started running by yourself, and there are plenty of places to go for advice. Any bookstore will have a section on running, and there are several magazines devoted to running. Any of these will offer you advice, and most publish training plans for most levels of runners. Use the internet too, to find information on running, equipment, injuries, and training. 

Most towns and cities have at least one running club. Check with your local gym to find out of there is one in your area. Most running clubs take runners of all levels, and the company of other runners is great for motivation, enjoyment and safety. Running is great way to meet new friends, and running clubs are a great place to start. 

If you’re just beginning, you probably don’t need a specialist coach, but do start with a visit to your family doctor for a checkup and to make sure you are healthy enough to start running. If you get more serious about your running, a coach can be a great help. Many running clubs have coaches to help them with programs to improve form, speed or endurance, and they can be a valuable source of advice and support. If you really want to get fast or run far, a coach is a good investment. 
Running and the weather Unlike many sports, running is one you can do year-round. But staying safe and healthy through four seasons of running requires some extra equipment and a few precautions.  
Running in winter In winter, runners need to stay warm, especially for the first ten minutes or so until the muscles have had a chance to get warm. Choose layers that you can easily remove as you get warm, and replace after you run to prevent chills. Gore-tex and other breathable fabrics will keep you warm and dry without overheating. Running draws muscles to the major muscle groups and the body’s torso, so it’s important you keep your extremities warm. A wool beanie hat and gloves are advisable for running in cold temperatures. 

Snow and ice can make the running surface slippery, risking falls and injury. Stay on cleared paths or trails and grass to get traction, and avoid running in deep snow. Snow can hide uneven terrain, roots, and potholes that can cause you to fall. 

That’s also true for darkness; with early nightfall in winter, be careful to run only in well lit areas. If you run in dusk or dark conditions, wear plenty of reflective clothing, a headlamp, or attach clip on bicycle lights to your clothing to make sure you can see, and be seen, by drivers, cyclists, and other road users.  
Running in summer In summer, heat is your main concern. Make sure you stay well hydrated, not just while you are running. By drinking regularly throughout the day your body will be better prepared form warm-weather running. It is possible to drink too much water, creating a very dangerous, even life threatening condition called hyponatremia. Prevent this and stay hydrated by replacing some of the water you drink with specialist sports drinks containing electrolytes and other ingredients to prevent hyponatremia. 

To help protect you from the effects of heat, choose light colored clothing, and protect your head from the sun’s rays with a vented running cap. Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes, especially if you run on bright surfaces like concrete. Avoid running in the hottest parts of the day, and always wear sunscreen on any exposed areas.",
General Model Kits,"General Model Kits Information  Introduction When entering a hobby store, you’re greeted with a vast display of model kits to choose from. Many of these kits involve putting together models that are meant for display only. Common examples of these types include car, ship, and aircraft. 

This style of model building is often called static models. One popular model vehicle that doesn’t follow this pattern is the model rocket. By looking at the parts used you can tell there is a significant difference between how the approach to building these models differs. 

In the static build the objective involves show casing minor details. In rocketry, the main goal is to display the physics of how a rocket worked. The static models call for the need for extra tools to assemble the pieces of the model together. A model rocket requires that you clearly understand the parts of the rocket to achieve success. The following sections will outline the important parts of each type of model. 
The static model Small gun turrets, detailed paint jobs, and just an overwhelming amount of detail surround this display based model. Whether it is land, sea or air, you’ll find a model based on real and conceptual vehicles. 

The parts of these models vary widely. After all, most ships don’t require tires and most cars aren’t sporting a set of wings. However, that doesn’t mean they can’t. Many times builders of static models will combine or alter a model to give an extra level of customization. 

This highlights where the enjoyment comes from in static model building. Modelers will enjoy the challenge of the build and the pride in the displaying of it. With such a wide variety to choose from they’re bound to find some vehicle that interests them. 

Due to the nature of this type of model it is important to point out that a modeler should equip themselves with certain tools. The following sections will cover these tools and then the steps you should take to succeed at this type of model building. 
Tools for static model kits If you find that you are serious about pursuing modeling, you’re going to need a number of tools to help in the process. These tools are broken up into two major groups. The first is the essential tools of the trade. These tools enable you to get the proper amount of detailing found in professionally built models. 

The second group of tools is more for luxury. These tools make the process easier and the outcome better. These tools are also more expensive so only get them if you find your hobby has turned into a passion. It’s recommended that you start with the basic tools before working your way up to the luxury tools.  
Essential Assembling a model by hand is only for the youngest and most basic model builder. These sets most likely have a snap together design with no tools required. Those types of models need little to know guidance and their outcome will show a very basic model. 

When you’re ready for the ones you want to display, you’ll need a few tools to help accomplish this. The following paragraphs will introduce the tool and describe some of the functionality of the tool. 

The first tool is a hobby knife. The knife comes in two parts the blade and the handle. The normal blade type used in model building is a number 11. The average brand for this knife is Exacto knife. The hobby knife is a great tool for removing plastic pieces from the sprues (the plastic frame that holds the pieces. It also is useful in removing the flash (extra plastic that is still attached to your piece) from the pieces. You can also use the knife in a dozen other situations that you might come across in the process of building the model. 

Safety glasses are an important part of model building. When you`re cutting pieces tiny shards and debris are likely to fly about causing minor annoyance and/or injury. Since a good degree of eye sight helps in the model building process, it’s wise not to chance blinding yourself. The safety glasses also play a substantial role in protecting your eyes from harsh glues paints and other materials you might need throughout the build. 

Sand paper can prove to be invaluable when trying to achieve a high degree of detail. It can be used to sand away excess glue or create a much smoother surface when painting. It’s recommended to get a variety of grits for these purposes. 400 to 1000 are perfectly suitable ranges when selecting the fineness of the grit. Some modelers go as fine as 2000 for their models. 

Fine tweezers make an excellent tool in model building. During any detailed model build, you’ll find occasions to handle extremely tiny pieces. These pieces require a fine tool to allow you to grip and place the piece while still being able to see the piece. The fine tweezers are custom designed exactly for this task. 

Paint brushes are a modeler’s best friend. Even when you use airbrushing techniques, you’ll still find that small out of the way parts will need a touch of paint. You can also use these delicate brushes to maintain your models. Perhaps they need a delicate dusting or a small piece needs a touch up to its paint job. Check with your local hobby store to determine if they recommend certain sizes for various jobs. 

Pins prove to be ideal for applying a very fine bead of glue. They not only have the ability for amazing precision, but they also give the modeler great visibility on where the glue will be applied. Since the pins are made of metal, they will resist bending or warping like other options you might think of to accomplish this task. 

Toothpicks may not be ideal for applying glue like pins, but they do have their uses. Mostly they’re best for stirring your small containers of paint. They also are a good for testing the color and consistency of your paint. It also helps that they’re really cheap. 

Glue, without it your models won’t stay together. Check your kit for suggestions on which glues will work best. If no suggestions are given, Testers Glue in the tube will serve for most things. You can also get the advice from the clerk at the hobby store. 

Filler, this usually comes in a tube. The large scale equivalent would probably be cocking. Its use here is to smooth out areas between glued parts. Once applied and set, you can use sand paper to smooth the area and get it prepped for painting. 

If you aren’t sure if a part fits together, tape makes an excellent tool for helping to figure this out. Tape also makes it easy to cover areas you don’t want painted. Use it similarly to how you’d paint around a window. 

Disposable gloves make a nice addition to your modeling tools. Some glue will recommend keeping away from contacting your skin. This will aid in making this possible. Also, gloves will help prevent finger prints when you get to the painting stage of your modeling project. 

Finally, paints and thinners are the final essential tools. This will be where the primary amount of customization of your model comes in. It’s recommended that you select the thinner that the paint used recommends. This will insure the most optimum effectiveness and reduce damage to your model.  
Luxury As you build more and more models, you might find that certain areas of the process must have an easier method. A lot of times they do. However, it’s really only justifiable if you use the tool more than a hand full of times. 

The following tools outlined here are designed to not only make your life easier, but give a more polished model. They may take some time to figure them out. Once you do, it will make a world of difference. 

The first two tools are the cutting pliers and razor saw. Both are designed for very precise cutting of small object. This makes pieces held by the toughest sprues a breeze. They can also come in handy if you need to convert a model and need a piece cut. 

For those who want a more specific tool, you do have the option of a sprue cutter. This tool is specifically designed for modelers to remove parts. The only draw back is that it has a little less functionality that the cutting pliers and razor saw. 

To get more visibility when assembling or painting your model, you can always invest in a desk lamp that has a magnifier. The magnification is not terribly powerful, but it does give you an edge in dealing with very small detail work. 

If you find you get tired of gluing and filling, you can move to a more advanced glue. It’s called Cyano-acrylate glue. Many refer to it as C.A. glue. This will not only glue pieces, but it makes excellent filler all in one. It is a very strong product, so it’s recommended to wear safety glasses with it. 

When attempting to get a better paint job on a model, it’s recommended to use either a spray can or airbrush. For an airbrush you’ll also need a small air compressor. Due to the application process, you will eliminate streaks left behind by brushes. 

Other accessories that can aid in the painting process help the modeler more than the model. Three such pieces of equipment are the paint booth, turntable and hot-glue gun. The paint booth will help ventilate and catch loose paint that shoots from the spray variety paint applicators. It is perfect for those who don’t have the option of building your model outside. 

The turntable allows the modeler from touching painted areas. The turning action also means they don’t have to get up from where they are sitting. 

The hot-glue gun is used slightly differently. By utilizing the glue on a scrap piece of material, you can use it to position small plastic pieces when painting them. Fortunately, this is probably something you already have and won’t be an additional cost. 

Finally, for the most advanced modelers, there’s the dremel motor tool. This is both a cutting and grinding device that makes alterations of plastic pieces possible. It’s recommended that when you begin using this tool, start out with more basic models that are less expensive. This will give you plenty of practice so that when it does matter you’ll have the experience needed for the job. 
Preparations for static model kits Before starting you will want to prepare a few things first. The most important point is deciding where you’re going to build the model. A flat sturdy surface is essential for this task. Many people will choose the dining room table for this very reason. However, the model may take more than one sitting to complete. 

This is why you should look for certain things when selecting a work space. First, is the surface flat and sturdy? Second, is there adequate lighting? Third, is there proper ventilation of the area? Fourth, is it okay if things spill in this area? With these questions answered you can determine the perfect spot for model building. 

Now that you have a work space all picked out, you need to prepare the parts. This includes washing the pieces before assembly. In the model making process, the pieces of your model have to be pulled out of a mold. To do this a mold removal agent is applied to the parts. This agent will prevent other materials from adhering to the surface of the pieces, this includes paint you might try using. 

This is why you should wash your pieces first. Take a pan of soapy water and lightly scrub the parts in the sprues with your finger. You can let the parts air dry on a paper towel or other soft clean surface. If beads of water settle on the parts you should use a blow drier to prevent them from spotting the pieces. 

You can repeat this process before painting your model. The oils in your fingers can have a distorting effect on your paint job. They may leave finger prints and or cause an uneven coat of paint. Fix parts that are defective in some way. This includes removing flash from the pieces. You can cut this off with a hobby knife. Fill in sink spots if necessary. Sink spots are typically caused by necessary techniques in the molding process. They show up as depressions in the plastic. Most of the time, these spots are put in out of the way places and don’t need filling. However, if the piece is highly visible you may need to use a filler. 

Another fix that some parts need are cosmetic than anything else. For example a part may contain a copyright stamp by the manufacturer. This will be very noticeable if you’re going for an extremely detailed look. You can remove this writing with some rubbing with sand paper. 

Read and make notes on your instructions. Many times the instructions will give you a good idea where the tough spots are in your model. You can make note of them and prepare yourself mentally to handle them. It also is good to make notes if you plan to alter the model’s design in certain areas. The instructions also are likely to provide a list of paints to use for an accurate portrayal of the model. With a list of paints in hand, you can have what you need when you need it. 

As stated before, a model may take more than one sitting. This means you might want to prepare an area for storing pieces. For decals and small pieces that have been painted, you should use zip-loc bags or similar type container for storage. For pieces still in the sprues you can fit these back in the box. Make sure to separate these pieces with paper towels to prevent scratching of the pieces. 

Now that you have all your tools and the prep work out of the way, you can begin building your favorite models. 
The functional model There is no real name for the type of model that a rocket represents. For ease of use we’ll refer to it as a functional model. As stated before, the key feature of this model is how it works. 

Occasionally, a rocket will have stickers and/or designs that you can add to the body. These are simple markings that really don’t make much of a difference. There is not even a wide array of specialty tools needed for assembly. 

To give a good example of a functional model, you need to look at what it is comprised of. You’ll find that in these types of models each part will perform a specific function. Remember, it is all about the operation and not the look of these models. The following is a breakdown of the parts of a rocket and how its pieces work together. 
Parts of the rocket Instead of a wide array of tools and small parts to glue together, a rocket follows a very basic design. Remember, the functionality of the rocket is more important than the detail that goes into a rocket. 

No matter the size, the principles of rocketry hold true. It’s learning how to apply those principles properly that is the trick. The following is a breakdown of a rocket then more specifically its engine. We’ll look at each piece and talk about what purpose it serves. Afterwards, you should get a good sense that a rocket uses no extra parts. It is straight forward in its design and functionality.  
The Rocket The top of a rocket should be the nose cone. This piece is responsible for reducing aerodynamic resistance on the rocket. This resistance is referred to as drag or aerodynamic drag. Some people may decorate this piece, but that is not necessary. 

The next piece along the body of the rocket is called the payload. This is what houses the cargo of the rocket. In model rockets this is often where the retrieval unit is stored. 

The last part of the rocket’s body is called the body tube. This portion of the rocket holds the engine and gives a mounting surface for the fins. Other smaller parts can be found in here. Those pieces will be indicated later. 

Moving to the inside of the rocket, you have the engine. This is not like a typical vehicle engine. Rather, it is a propulsion unit that drives the rocket forward. It is located inside the body tube. 

Next to the engine you’ll have the thrust ring. This piece keeps the engine from shooting through the rocket itself. Consider it as a type of bracing that the rocket has against the engine. It is also located inside the body tube. 

Moving towards the nose, you’ll have the wadding. This is a protective material that keeps the engine from burning the retrieval unit. As seen later, the retrieval unit is very often flammable so requires this protection. 

This brings us to the retrieval unit. There are a wide variety of types of retrieval units. They could involve gliding wings, helicopter style propellers, streamers, etc. The most commonly known retrieval unit is a small parachute. Most of these units will be deployed when the rocket splits in half. 

To accomplish this, an ejection charge is used. This provides the proper deployment of the retrieval device. This is actually part of the engine. 

Connecting the retrieval unit to the rocket are the shroud lines. These lines are typically packed in with the retrieval unit. 

Since a sudden deployment of a retrieval unit would most likely destroy a rocket, there needs to be something that absorbs the shock of the impact. For this purpose, there is the shock chord. The shock chord connects the cone to the body and anchors the shroud lines. 

The rocket will also have a small tube called a launch lug. This serves to guide the rocket at launch. It works by fitting over a launch rod. The launch rod is not part of the rocket. The rod is approximately thirty six inches long and can be used to point the rocket in a direction. The launch lug provides this important guidance that the rocket needs. 

Finally, there are the fins. Once the rocket reaches proper speed and wind resistance, these are the only thing that keep its trajectory. The proper speed is roughly thirty miles an hour. This speed needs to be attained before the rocket the end of the launch rod. If not, the fins may not have enough influence over the rocket to guide it. This is why they don’t recommend modifying a rocket kit since all the specifics have been worked out. Tampering with the rocket may result in an unexpected result.  
The engine The engine or motor of a rocket is the most important element of a rocket. It provides the thrust needed to achieve launch which is the main goal behind building one of these kits. Because of this fact, extra details about the engine are presented here. 

The ejection charge as stated before releases the retrieval unit through the proper apogee. The apogee is the opening designed to open to release or eject something specifically. In this case, it will release the retrieval device like a parachute. 

Since the ejection charge is a substance rather than a piece or part, it requires a container to hold it. This container is called a retainer cap in a rocket. Its only function is to hold the charge while it waits to be ignited. 

Because you don’t want the retrieval device to deploy as the rocket launches, an element is needed to prevent immediate ignition of the ejection element. This element is called the delay element. Not only does it act like a time delay fuse, but it also provides a smoke trail for your eyes to follow. 

Now we move onto the propellant. This is the chemical compound that will provide thrust to your engine. When it burns it creates a gas exhaust that takes up more room than the space it’s in. Therefore, it must find a way out. This force that seeks release gives the rocket its thrust. 

Thrust alone will launch the rocket a short ways up. In order to intensify the thrust model rockets come with a ceramic disk with a hole in it. This piece is called the nozzle. By forcing escaping exhaust gasses through a much smaller hole, the speed at which the gas escapes needs to increase. Remember, it still needs to displace the same volume of material. Therefore, you have a chain reaction. 

To better understand how this works, let’s use the example of a water hose. When you turn it on water begins pouring out. Consider the water thrust provided by the propellant. Now put your hand over the end of the hose. As you can tell, you can’t really stop the water from coming out. So it tries to escape through any small opening your hand might provide. Since the same amount of water needs to come out the end result is stronger streams of water. This is how a nozzle works. 

The last part of the rocket’s engine is the mechanism used to ignite the propellant. Since it’s very dangerous to use hand held ignition devices igniter wires are provided for this purpose. This will allow remote launching of your rocket. 
What you need The real task before you is to decide which model type suits you best. To do this you might want to find a hobby store that specializes in models. There you can either browse and find what interests you or ask for advice from the sales associate. 

Once you select your favorite you can have limitless fun. In every model category there is a progression of more and more advanced options. This means, the hobby doesn’t have to stop with just one build. This type of hobby can form a collection. 
Conclusion With the wide variety of different types of vehicle models it’s hard to choose just one. Fortunately, you don’t have to. If cars and planes interest you, there is no reason you can’t build models of different vehicles. 

Model building also has models whose difficulty scales as much as its size. That way, every member of your family can have their own model that suits them. It is a truly unique hobby that promotes the mind. And when everything is done, you have something to show for it. Not many hobbies can boast something like that.",
Go Karts,"Introduction to Go KartsIt`s been fifty years since Art Ingels first created the Go Karts in California, which has now become a worldwide phenomenon. Being one of the fastest growing hobbies in the world it has a huge fan following in North America. Initially they were referred to as go carts, gokarts, and shifter karts. However, they are today universally known as Go Karts. After the Second World War fighter pilots and airmen had very little to do at air force stations and so to pass their time they started racing Go Karts and a sport was born.Go Karts are closely related to open wheel racing such as Indy Car and Formula One. In fact, some of the top professional race car drivers have had their initiation into the sport through Go Karting. Ayrton Senna, Prost, Patrese, Michael Schumacher, Alonso, Raikkonen, Button, Lewis Hamilton, Darrell Waltrip, Sarah Fisher, Kyle Petty, Tony Stewart, and many others began their careers on the Go Karting circuit before graduating to Formula One and Indy Car. Go Karting is addictive and people get hooked onto the thrill of racing after their very first ride in a Go Kart. Scooters, bikes, ATVs,mopeds and dirt bikes all fade in comparison to Go Karting. The adrenaline rush you get when you race a Go Kart on the track is what makes it so popular amongst the young and the old.Go Karts have come a long way since they were first introduced. They were one step ahead of bumper cars, but today`s Go Karts can go as fast as 200 mph and handling them has become pretty easy due to the sophistication in design and materials. Most professional race car drivers perfect their skills on Go karts before advancing to auto racing.",
Piano Keyboard,"Piano Keyboard Information  Intro Learning any kind of music or musical instrument is a wonderful hobby that can easily turn into a profession. It can be extremely satisfying, after the initial hard work, to be able to produce sounds that refresh, elevate and soothe. You also need to make sure that you can spare the time to attend your piano lessons. It could need at least an hour each day for practicing. 

So how does one get started with playing the piano? You can start your piano lessons even with a digital keyboard linked to your computer, but there’s nothing like an acoustic piano in the long run if you intend to take up this hobby seriously. 

Once you invest in a piano you will need to make sure that you take good care of it and maintain it properly. Apart from a piano, you must be prepared to pay for your piano lessons. Private lessons are considered best since the teacher can understand your abilities well and steer you in the right direction for the appropriate techniques to use. In this aspect, no software can substitute the attention and guidance that you can get from a real piano teacher. 
Choosing Your Piano Tutor You need to be totally at ease with your piano tutor to be able to develop your abilities at the right pace. A good piano tutor will probably have a Bachelor’s Degree in Music in addition to being active with performing regularly in public as well as being a member of various organizations related to music. A dedicated piano teacher will let you use their computer training lab, give you access to their regular newsletters, introduce you to competitive performances. So don’t go by what fees they charge you. Paying a little more and getting all this is better than paying a little less for just coaching alone. 

While some teachers are prepared to come to your home at an extra fee and coach you, most expect you to go to their studio to learn. 

So while choosing your piano tutor, find out about his or her experience and qualifications, what they expect from you as a student, what you can expect from them and the type of music they teach. You will need to know whether the teacher covers music theory and various techniques. You may also like to know how many other students the piano tutor teaches and whether teaching piano is their full time activity. 
Tips To Get Started With Playing The Piano The first thing you need to do is of course get some music theory basics. While this can sound a little tedious, when all you want to do is get your hands on the keys and start playing, it is essential to know theory to get a true understanding, if you are really serious about playing the piano or any musical instrument, for that matter. 

Next comes listening to as much piano music as you can. If you listen to the music, you can gradually pick out the notes you hear and perhaps practice along with the music. This will help you over time, to identify the notes, intervals and patterns of the chords being played. It may be a little tough in the beginning, but you will become proficient at it soon. You will notice, as you listen to the piano recordings, that some pianists follow a particular pattern and keep repeating them across the songs they play. So something that probably sounds complex will be quite easy once you understand how it is done. 

You are possibly wondering what you should concentrate on when you practice. Now this will depend on what you are aiming for. When you practice scales, you will be able to develop expertise on the keyboard with your fingers. You will also be able to relate with music theory better, allowing you to recognize which key you need to begin a song with, in addition to automatically knowing the sharp notes and flat notes that appear in the song. Start your practice initially with scales taking it slowly. 
What Is Your Goal? You need to decide whether you would like to be a writer and composer of music, or improvise or directly play from sheet music. Some people tend to literally play piano ‘by ear’. We could say that there are, in general, two types of pianists. The ones that play it by ear and the ones that read the music sheets. There are some exceptional pianists who have the ability to do both. 

The experts advise that no matter what your goal is, you cannot bypass learning music theory. It is only then that you can express yourself through your music with passion and feeling. 

This information will get you started in your piano-playing hobby, along with the resources below where there are plenty of instructional videos, links to piano lessons, book recommendations and educational articles that will equip you will all you need to know about this satisfying hobby – playing the piano. 
Playing The Piano – A Soothing Hobby – Part II The Piano is a wonderful instrument that enhances any type of music it is used with. It is so versatile that it has the ability to fit into a variety of music contexts, whether as a solo instrument or as an accompaniment. The piano is a lovely instrument to compose and to practice on, and helps you become skilled in musical notation. For those who already know to play other musical instruments, the piano simply lets you enjoy and build on your musical talent even more. By now, you have already decided on your purpose to learn to play the piano. Above we talked about how to get started with your piano-playing hobby, how to choose a piano tutor, and some tips. Let us now explore this wonderful hobby in a little more depth. In this article, we will cover the following aspects of playing the piano: 

• Keyboard or real piano? 

• A basic introduction on how to read piano notes 

• Finger placement 

• Foot pedals 

You will need access to a piano, or buy one if you can. Good quality grand pianos can set you back a few thousands of dollars, so you might think of going in for an electronic keyboard. You may not quite get the exact sound of the piano, but a keyboard can be a convenient investment for a beginner as they are affordable, easy to use and best of all, portable. If you are really keen on a real piano, you can check with your local music store to see if they have rental pianos. The main thing to check here is to make sure the notes are pure. 

In this context, you are probably wondering what difference it could make whether you learn on a keyboard or a real piano. The fact is, each has its own advantages. Depending on which is more convenient, you can make your choice. 
So, Keyboard Or Real Piano? These days, digital keyboards are very advanced. They sound almost as good as a real piano. This is basically because manufacturers use authentic sound samples from the acoustic grand pianos. A big advantage with keyboards is that you don’t have to tune them, since they always stay in tune. You can carry them around wherever you want. A majority of them cost a lot less than a real piano. The expensive models use weighted wooden piano keys just like those of a real piano. You can also fix headphones to practice in private. Some of these keyboards come with enhancements like extra instrumental and percussion sound effects that make them more fun to use. 

However, ask any piano enthusiast and they will swear that a real acoustic piano is the best. It is a fact that this complex instrument with its myriad mechanical inner parts produces sounds that are unique to each performer – something that is not possible with an electronic keyboard. The vibrating strings and wood create sounds and a resonance that is impossible to duplicate. There are delicate nuances of the foot pedal’s effects that cannot be reproduced by digital effects. 

So the decision is yours to make depending on your priorities. Most learners get started with a keyboard if they cannot access an acoustic piano. Here your goals play an important role. If your objective is short term and is only to enjoy learning some music, then a keyboard will probably suffice. But if it is developing playing skills in the long term that you are after, an acoustic piano is best. 
A Basic Introduction On How To Read Piano Notes No matter what type of pianist you are or what your goal is, you have to have the basics of music theory to truly express yourself. Here is a quick introduction to piano notes and how to recognize them. While this obviously cannot be an exhaustive lesson, it can get you experimenting with the notes and try to play simple songs. You can use the valuable resources listed on our website to go deeper into this aspect. 

Basically, music notes are of three types: 

• The natural notes – written as the note letter 

• Sharp notes – shown by the symbol # 

• Flat notes – shown by the letter b 

This means if you say B, it is B natural; G# is G sharp and Ab is A flat. 

Each piano key plays a specific note. How would you identify each note? 

There is a pattern to the keys. The white keys occur through the length of the keyboard and they denote the natural keys. There are seven notes represented as A, B, C, D, E, F and G. The pattern of these seven notes repeats itself. So you find A to G, then A to G again and so on. 

Notice the way the black keys are grouped in alternating pairs of twos and threes. This helps identify the notes. Look at the keyboard again, and you will see, for instance, how the C note always occurs to the left of a group of two black keys. In the same way, let us find the other six notes. You will find: 

• D note in the middle of the group of two black keys 

• E note at the left of the group of two black keys 

• F note at the left of the group of three black keys 

• G note – between first and second black key of a group of three black keys. 

• A note between the second and third black keys of a group of three black keys 

• B note at the right of the group of three black keys 

The black keys get their note value from the white keys around them and are denoted by a sharp ‘#’ or a flat ‘b’. Sharp means the key is half a step higher than the white note at its left. Flat means it is half a step lower than the white key to the right. 

With practice you can become proficient at finding the notes on the keyboard. After you learn notes, you will learn how they are combined to form major chords, minor chords and scales. To play different types of chords, you need to follow the correct finger positions. 
Finger Placement When you learn to play music, you will generally begin by reading simple sheet music. To understand and play, you must learn the correct finger placement. To help you do this each finger is denoted by a number. This means the thumb is 1, the index finger is 2, the middle finger is 3, the ring finger is 4 and the little finger is 5. Accordingly, the sheet will indicate, by number, where each finger must be placed. 
Foot Pedals Once you are well on your way to knowing the basic notes and techniques of playing the piano’s keyboard, you want to know about the piano’s foot pedals. These add a depth to the piano’s sounds. The piano has three foot pedals. 

• Soft pedal played with the left foot, which softens the tone of the notes. 

• Sostenuto pedal in the middle, also played with the left foot, which sustains only the notes that are hit when the pedal pressed down. 

• Sustain pedal, which is played with the right foot and used the most. It sustains all the strings on the piano, removing the dampers that muffle the vibration. It helps pianists achieve the legato. 

Most piano music needs the sustain pedal, with the soft pedal being used once in a while. The sostenuto pedal is infrequently used and not all pianos have it. The best thing to do is to explore all the pedals to get a feel of them and understand how they affect your sounds. 

You are probably eager to find out how to choose a piano, what to look for in a piano, types of pianos, detailed tutorials on how to play notes, various types of chords and scales, practice lessons, and much more. You can find all this information at the following website, along with videos, more useful links and excellent books on playing the piano and everything else related to it. Enjoy! After all, practice puts you on the road to perfection.",

Jewelry Making,"Jewelry Making Information  Introduction Jewelry design is a hobby that opens up a lot of scope to show your creativity, especially if you happen to have an eye for detail. This hobby can easily turn into a lucrative home business or career with a prominent name in the industry. To begin with, most aspiring jewelry designers experiment with designs and make jewelry items as gifts for their loved ones. 

There are many tools and materials to work with. As a hobby, jewelry design can be as expensive or as inexpensive as you want, depending on what kind of jewelry you intend to make – ranging from simple wire jewelry to intricate items with metals and precious stones. 

Some well-known jewelry designers are Tiffany, Cartier, Faberge and Boucheron, all of whom excelled in high fashion jewelry design. Their designs were usually created for prominent personalities to commemorate special events. They worked with imagination, creativity and style. You can, too. 
Three critical elements of jewelry design When you decide to take up jewelry design as a hobby, remember that you need to do some planning before you actually get started. According to the top jewelry designers, there are three essential elements to keep in mind when you create your unique piece of jewelry. These are: 

-Design 

-Quality of materials 

-Craftsmanship 

The design is what you express through your creativity, so that you can translate it into an actual piece of jewelry. Next is the quality of the materials you work with. This could be gemstones, precious metals or other material you will work with. These must suit your design and enhance it. After you finalize your design and get the material together, it is time to put your design into a wearable piece of jewelry. 

So let us now look at how you can get started with your jewelry design hobby! 
Getting started Getting started with jewelry design can be exciting. There are many techniques in jewelry making. It is a good idea to get started with beading, which is one of the easiest methods. With wire and beads that you can get from your local craft store, you can design simple jewelry items like bracelets, earrings, necklaces and finger rings. 

You might want to consider getting a book on jewelry design to inspire you. Then you will need to get the necessary supplies and tools and of course, bags or boxes in which to display your completed jewelry. 

Jewelry must be made carefully, regardless of whether it is a delicate piece or a chunky one, expensive or not. Always remember that. Whether as a hobby or profession, designing jewelry can be fun because it lets you experiment, while coming up with interesting pieces of jewelry. You can never tell when your hobby could turn into a lucrative career or profession since there is vast scope in this industry. There is a huge market out there both for men’s and women’s jewelry.  
Choose your style The first step to getting started is to choose your style. There is no hard and fast rule. But you might want to focus on a particular style depending on your preference. This could be traditional or trendy. Traditional jewelry could be similar to the chokers or necklaces while trendy jewelry can combine a variety of materials like stones, metals, leather, wood or pearls. If you intend designing jewelry as gifts, then think about the person who will wear them. Older women prefer pearl jewelry, while younger women prefer something funkier. The ideal gifts for men seem to be earrings, studs or bracelets.  
Get your tools together After you make up your mind what kind of jewelry you want to design, it is time to put together the tools and material you need. This includes tools you need, as well as beads, stones, clasps, strings, hooks etc. These can be bought at a jewelry supply store. 

Here is a basic list of tools you might need, depending on your project: 

- Pliers of several sizes & types - Tweezers - straight and bent depending on what you are making - Mandrels - if making wire wrap jewelry - Wire cutters - Clippers for thread, if beading - Polishing cloth - if you plan on working with sterling silver  
Material for jewelry making This is a matter of choice, but you might be looking at: 

- Beads - Gemstones and synthetics - Gold and silver - Metal wire - Polymer clay - Organic or natural elements - Anything you intend working with  
What type of jewelry will you make? Again, you have a huge choice here. Just some of the jewelry items you can design are: 

- Necklaces - Bracelets - Earrings - Rings and toe rings - Wedding and engagement rings - Belly-button jewelry - Brooches and pins - Men`s jewelry, such as cufflinks and tie pins - Belt buckles - Tiaras - Buttons  
Creating your workspace You will need a space of your own to work in when you design your jewelry. Choose a spot that lets you concentrate. Find a private place – this could be in your garage, your attic. Remember you’ll need adequate lighting, which is an important aspect of jewelry designing. Natural light is best, but if that is not available, look for good alternatives that resemble sunlight. For instance, full spectrum bulbs can be a good choice. 

Next, you will need to organize your tools and supplies. There are professional jewelry benches in the market, but these can be quite expensive. You can also look for one in used furniture stores. It goes without saying that you will need a comfortable chair, since you will be spending a lot of time in it. 

If you do not want to spend money on creating your workspace right away, you can also simply clear your kitchen table and get started there!  
Design your jewelry Come up with your jewelry design now. You will find a lot of ideas online or in magazines to inspire you. Designing wire jewelry is very popular and many people have turned this into a lucrative hobby. Wire is especially easy for beginners to work with. Let us take a look at the tools and materials you need to get you started on making wire jewelry.  
Wire jewelry design Tools 

- Pliers – there is an assortment of pliers and cutters you will find for wire jewelry. Each of these is meant for a particular job. As you get further in your hobby, you will probably build your own collection of pliers and cutters. As a beginner, you can get started with a few. Pliers come with different nose shapes and some have springs, which help control the wire’s tension. You will also find pliers with nylon jaws to keep the wire from getting scratched. 

- Flat Nose Pliers - used for holding, flattening or straightening the wire, these help in making angular bends. 

- Round Nose Pliers – help with making bends, curves and loops especially when your work involves a lot of detail. 

- Flush Wire Cutter - this cuts through metal like gold, silver, brass and copper wire neatly.  
Choosing the wire for the jewelry You can choose your wire based on thickness, shape, hardness and material. 

- You will find wire in different sizes, or gauges. Gauges work like this: a higher gauge wire has a smaller diameter than a lower gauge wire. When you start off, go in for higher gauge wire so that you find it easy to work with. 

- As your skill grows, you will find it easier to work with thicker wires. You can also get wire in different shapes like round, square and semi-round. The most common choice is round wire. To give your jewelry a unique look, you can choose an unusual shape. 

- Wire is available as soft and hard wire. Softer wire is easy to bend while the harder ones are tougher to shape. So depending on your jewelry you can choose the right kind of wire. 

- You can choose from brass, copper, silver and gold wire. Naturally, copper and brass are less expensive compared with silver and gold. Begin with copper and brass, to help you get used to your hobby initially. 

As you can see, there’s a lot of choice in material and your jewelry design can be made, keeping in mind the right kind of tools and material.  
And now, it is time to design your first piece of jewelry You now have your work area marked out and your supplies in place. It is time to design your very first piece of jewelry. You are probably overflowing with ideas by now. So it is time to get started. If you find it challenging at first to put your design on paper, you can browse the internet for wire jewelry, or even look at beginner’s books that give you step-by-step instructions on how to go about it. 
Design tips Now that you are excited about your jewelry design hobby, here are some design tips that will help you. These tips apply to any kind of jewelry you might decide to design. 

- Stick to a few designs initially. Too many can be confusing at first, making it hard to choose your material. 

- Begin with the focal point of your design, which can be a gemstone in the center or whatever you choose to make the focal point. This is what people will notice first when they see your design. 

- Avoid using two or more center pieces as this can make your design look crowded. If you are using stones, using two or more of the same size will not be complementary and make it difficult to balance. 

- If you are working with precious stones, remember that anything that is more than .25 carat in round, marquise, oval and pear shapes are good for the overall design. While size or shape do not determine your design, emeralds can be hard to use in a round shape. You decide. 

- Keep your design simple and balanced. Sometimes less can be more. 

- Refer to jewelry magazines, jewelry store catalogs and websites online. This will get your creative juices flowing and trigger your unique ideas. 

- When you design jewelry, remember to start with the central gemstone followed by the mounting design. After this, decide on the gemstones or finishes that will highlight your central gemstone. Everything about the jewel must focus on the central gemstone in terms of form, shape and finish. 

- When you set the central gemstone, the mounting should be aligned with it in shape, setting off its beauty. Go in for shapes that match the center stone. It is okay to make it unusual by setting it off center. Soon, you’ll have a great piece of jewelry. 

- The center gemstone should be set off by the stones or finishes that accent it. The ratio to remember is, half your design is about the center stone, a quarter about the way it is mounted, and the remaining part is the accents and the finish. Go ahead and be creative, taking care that your design looks balanced. 

- Color plays a pivotal role in your design. This means that some gemstones suit yellow metal while some suit white metal. For example, if your gemstone is white or blue, it is better off in a white metal setting. While this is not a rule that cannot be broken, it is the norm, depending on your design and technique. A little bit of research about color combinations when you plan your jewelry design will go a long way. 

- Choose the design style that matches your personal taste and your personality. Make a statement through your work. Feel comfortable with whatever you design, as it will be identified with you. 

- Make sure your presentation and balance are well matched. All the design elements like color, setting and impression should be complementary. 

- Plan your design as this the starting point, helping you get a grip on the design process from beginning to end. This will enable you come up with a design that you are completely satisfied with. 

- You can use technology to see how your finished jewelry will look in color, with a graphic design program on your computer. This will give your imagination a new dimension as you add and accent on your screen 

- Once you have your design ready, you are ready to make the prototype. If working with gemstones set in precious metal, you might want to make a wax model first. This will help you make the necessary adjustments and changes, which are hard to do with precious metal. While working with the wax model, you will also know if there are any practical problems with the design that can be changed. 

- If you decide to work with precious metals, you might need the help of a goldsmith to transform your design into the jewelry piece. Make sure you see visuals of how your design settings and finish will appear before the goldsmith begins to work on it. There must be a balance of texture and depth, resulting in your imagination brought to life. 

- Finally, think about durability. Some jewelry designers make fabulous pieces that develop the need for repairs after a short period of time. So think about how well it will wear by using the appropriate materials. 

Talking about wearability, as a jewelry designer, you not only end up making jewelry pieces, but might sometimes have to handle jewelry repair as well. 
Should you handle jewelry repairs? Most jewelry shops offer jewelry repair as a part of their services. In fact, jewelry repair brings in substantial revenue. You will find that most jewelry courses include a session on jewelry repair. So, you will probably find yourself having to fix an item once in a while. It is an unavoidable part of jewelry design and jewelry making. Even if you give someone your work of art, there’s a good chance that they might come back because it broke, or came unstuck. This can happen with gemstones and clasps. Nevertheless, you would need to fix it for them. 

If you start an exclusive line in jewelry based on your design for special customers, naturally they would come back to you if they had a problem. Even if your jewelry items were perfectly okay, your customer will think of you if they have a problem with any of their jewelry items. Thus, you need to decide whether you will handle these repairs yourself, and how. 

This is a question especially if you make different types of jewelry. Your customer may approach you to fix a broken clasp. If you are not experienced with techniques like soldering, now may be the time to develop some good contacts in jewelry shops that can handle these repairs for you. If you go commercial and sell your jewelry, you will have to think about charging for these repairs and this can be a delicate affair, because most customers simply assume you’ll do it for free, while the rare ones will agree to pay you. 
In closing Jewelry is something everyone loves. Trends in jewelry design change rapidly, and so do the methods of making jewelry. The great thing about jewelry design is you can simply follow your imagination. All you need are the right supplies and tools to put the pieces together to come up with that special, unique piece. Just remember some basic rules. Choose materials that are durable yet easy to use. This will ensure that your jewelry pieces last. It is great to be unique, but not at the cost of durability. This will ensure that your designs are remembered in the long run. 

Today, there are millions of accessories that you can use in designing jewelry. Beads are perhaps the most popular preference as they can easily be strung to make a bracelet, earring or necklace and there you are – your jewelry is ready. You can also use wood, plastic and glass to go with the beads. Gemstones can give your design a more expensive look. Carved wood pendants look great with good, silver or bronze necklaces. No matter what material you use, be careful that the focal point of your jewelry does not get damaged over time. Look always for materials that help you create lasting designs. 

Packaging is an important aspect of jewelry design. If you turn your jewelry design hobby into a profession, you will need to think about displaying and packaging your designs. 

Jewelry design is a wonderful hobby that lets you show your creativity. You can wear your own creations, give them as gifts, or sell them and make money. Go ahead and let your creativity take wing. Express yourself through your designs. Create jewelry that is one of a kind and memorable.",
Mountain Biking,"Mountain Biking Information  Introduction Mountain biking is a hobby that entails riding bikes offroad, many times over rough terrain. There are specialized mountain bikes to cope with this terrain and increase the bikes durability. The different mountain biking categories are downhill, cross country, free riding, urban / street, dirt jumping, and all mountain. 
Important Cycling Skills As you begin cycling, take your time. Until you are familiar with what your body is capable of, avoid bicycle overuse. Try short, easy rides to start. Gradually increase your distance and difficulty to develop your strength, stamina, and ability without causing injuries. 

Before You Ride 

Learn to adjust your bicycle to fit your body. You can adjust the saddle, the handlebars, and the location of the brake levers. 

Gauge your fitness level prior to beginning a new sport. If you have been largely inactive for several years, you may wish to begin your training indoors and progress to outdoor cycling as your fitness level increases.  
Basic Skills Braking 

Pay attention to your surroundings and prepare to stop if necessary. On flat surfaces, use your front brakes more. When braking on a downhill slope, use your back brakes more. On steep hills, use your back brakes to prevent flying forward. 

Changing Gears 

Again, preparation is key when changing gears. Try to switch to the gear you plan to use before you need it. When shifting, remember to keep pedaling to allow the chain to move to the correct gear. 

Pedal Properly 

Pedaling isn`t just pushing your pedals around and around. There is technique to proper pedaling. Instead of pushing down right away, push forward a little. Lower your heel as the pedal drops and pick it up again as the pedal nears the bottom of the turn. Pull the pedal back with your toes and then relax. Practicing efficient pedaling will reduce stress on your muscles and improve your cycling ability. 

Turn Corners 

Try to center yourself in the trail or road to take the straightest path possible around the corner. Once you are in the corner, stop pedaling. Keep your outside foot low and your inside foot high to stop your feet or your pedal from hitting anything. Straighten your bike and accelerate out of the corner. 
Parts of mountain bikes Most mountain bikes are designed for specific functions, but they all share a few basic characteristics. 

Wheels and tires 

Mountain bike wheels are robust, with many spokes, and usually 26” in diameter. 29” wheels are becoming more common, because they roll over obstacles easier, although these wheels are often less maneuverable. Tires come is different treads depending on the type of terrain and the weather, but all are designed to be ‘knobby’ for good traction, and to shed mud and dirt easily. 

Brakes 

Some mountain bikes have traditional cantilever brakes like road bikes, but more and more riders are opting for the additional braking power of hydraulic disc brakes. Disk brakes are heavier, and harder to maintain, but they are more effective at stopping a heavy bike travelling on uneven ground. 

Front suspension 

Almost all mountain bikes will come with some degree of front suspension, or ‘shock’ on the fork of the bike. This is essential to allow the front wheel to maintain momentum as it rolls over rocks, roots, and other obstacles. Some bikes allow the rider to adjust the suspension while riding, so they can opt for a stiffer ride when climbing ills, and then a softer ride for bumpy trails. 

Rear suspension 

Bikes without any rear suspension or shock are called ‘hardtails’. These bikes are stiffer, more responsive and lighter, so are a popular choice for racers. A rear shock, or a ‘full suspension’ bike, with up to 5” of travel is a good choice for a novice rider, or a rider that expects to ride of technical or bumpy trails. Some bikes have up to 7” of travel in the rear shock for jumping and tricks; these bikes are harder to pedal as much of the rider’s power is absorbed by the shock itself, but they certainly make for a more comfortable ride on very difficult terrain. 

Gears 

Mountain bikes usually have plenty of gears to make pedaling up hills, on rough terrain, and through sand and mud easier. Shifters are normally on the handlebars, or you can find ‘grip shifters’ which the rider operates by squeezing and turning the handlebar grips. Having the shifters in easy reach is essential, as most riders won’t want to take their hands off the handlebars on tricky terrain! 

To allow for more ground clearance for the chain, many bikes fit plastic guards to the chainrings, and some designs use pulleys and other technology to keep the chain clear of roots and rocks. 

Pedals 

Bicycle pedals is where the rider places the shoes. There are clipless and clip pedals, for mountain biking traditionally people use clipless given the extra time needed to get out of in the case of a fall.",
Card Games,"Card Games Information  Introduction One of the earliest forms of entertainment that has lasted the test of time is also one of today’s most common hobbies. Card games have been around for centuries, at least since playing cards where invented, which was somewhere around the seventh century, and they don’t seem to be going anywhere any time soon. The reasons behind this are many, but perhaps the main reason is that from a simple deck of cards, there are literally thousands of different games that one could play, and due to the versatility of card players, new games can be created by anyone at anytime. The plus side to taking up card games as a hobby is that a standard deck of cards can cost less than a dollar for an inexpensive deck, and you actually don’t even need a partner to begin playing games. With just yourself and a deck of cards, you can easily play over a hundred different card games by yourself like Solitaire or Free Cell, but for those out there that like card games to be a more social affair, there are an endless supply of games that can be played with two or more partners. 

The questions you have to ask yourself when getting into card games is what types of games do you like, and in what social context are you going to be playing. For those playing by themselves, the only real choice is simple Solitaire games, which more often than not are designed to trap a player while trying to change the order of the cards from mixed to numerical sorted. Most games played in a social context with friends or family are designed to collect pairs of cards, like in the game Go Fish, or is a test to get rid of all you cards first, like in the game Crazy 8’s. These games are the most common card games that most people will play, and different games like these exist throughout the world and vary through different cultures. Other games that have grown in popularity recently are casino style games, like Poker, Blackjack, Red Dog, ect., where there are a certain set of rules that all players must play by in order to have a chance of winning a certain amount of money. Obviously, when there is real money at stake, like that of casino card games, the social aspect of the game is almost irrelevant to the game and is replaced with the need to win money, and with the need to win money, there comes a lot of serious problems and addictions that everyone must be concerned about prior to playing these types of games. Regardless of the type of card games you are looking to learn and play, the key to the hobby is to simply have fun. 
Solitaire Card Games The first main group of card games is called Solitaire games, which means that they are designed to be played by one player. For a lot of people out there, this is the type of game that one plays when they are board or simply wasting time. For others, these are challenging games that are an addiction that are used to challenge the mind by using logic to try to solve the puzzles created by the cards. These games are often designed to challenge the player to sort the cards by number or suit, but the challenge is that your moves and decisions may cause the game to come to a halt by blocking a card with other cards. Most of these games begin with a specific layout of cards, called a tableau, and the object is then either to construct a more elaborate final layout, or to clear the tableau, the draw pile, the card stock, or any combination of the three by moving all cards to one or more ""discard"" or ""foundation"" piles. It sounds complicated, but it really isn’t. One of the tougher games to win is a game called Free Cell where you have all the cards dealt out in 8 vertical piles. The goal of the game is to get all of the card into 4 slots individual piles sorted by suit and increasing numerically. So by moving the cards between the 8 piles, and cards can only be placed numerically (IE: 5-4-3-2), you must move the card into their sorted piles by suit and number. Sounds easy, but if you can’t get to a two of diamonds because other cards are covering it, you have to more the other cards or forfeit the game. Although solitaire games are fun, they can be quite challenging, and just because you aren’t playing with a partner, doesn’t mean you can’t lose. 
Companion Card Games Companion card games, or card games that require 2 or more people to play, make up a majority of the card games that are known throughout the world. These games vary from country to country and culture to culture, but most of them are essentially the same game with different names and usually tweaked rules. Of the thousands of card games that you can learn, most card games can be broken down into just a handful of categories. For our purposes, I have simplified the thousands of games into a handful of categories called matching, trick taking, shedding, and casino type of card games. This is just a simplified way to describe the most card games available without making an endless list of games. With new games being created on a daily basis, it is actually impossible to track all card games being invented on a day to day basis, but there are some very popular games that you will probably recognize as you read. 

One of the first types of card games that are learned by beginners or children are matching games. The goal is to accumulate the required groups of matching cards before an opponent can do so. A more advanced type of this game is called Rummy where this is done through drawing and discarding, and the groups are called melds. Mahjong is a very similar game played with tiles instead of cards. Non-Rummy examples of match-type games generally fall into the ""fishing"" genre and include the children`s games Go Fish and Old Maid. Another similar type of game is called a shedding game where players start with a hand of cards, and the object of the game is to be the first player to discard all cards from one`s hand. Some matching-type games are also shedding-type games; some variants of Rummy such as Phase 10 and Rummikub, as well as the children`s game Old Maid, Crazy 8’s, and Uno fall into these categories. 

One of the most popular types of card games is the trick-taking game, which is based on the play of multiple rounds, or tricks, in each of which each player plays a single card from their hand, and based on the values of played cards, one player wins or ""takes"" the trick. The specific objective varies with each game and can include taking as many tricks as possible, taking as many scoring cards (or as few penalty cards) within the tricks won as possible, taking as few tricks as possible, or taking an exact number of tricks. Bridge, Whist, Euchre, Spades, Hearts, Twenty-eight, or Twenty Nine are popular examples that are played by many throughout the world. 

One of the most popular types of card games are Casino type games that revolve around wagers of money. Though virtually any game in which there are winning and losing outcomes can be wagered on, these games are specifically designed to make the betting process a strategic part of the game. Some of these games involve players betting against each other, such as poker, while in others, like blackjack, players wager against the house through the dealer. Poker is a family of gambling games in which players bet into a pool, called the pot, that the value of their hand will beat all others according to the ranking system. Variants largely differ on how cards are dealt and the methods by which players can improve a hand. For many reasons, including its age and its popularity among Western militaries, it is one of the most universally known card games in existence, and in recent years, the popularity of poker has been skyrocketing. 
Perfect for All Ages and People Playing cards is the probably one of the only hobbies in the world today that is accessible and fun for people of all ages. Unlike other activities that require athleticism or a ton of money to get into, playing cards only requires a deck of cards and a bit of patience to learn the rules of the specific game you are trying to learn. In most cases, card games are often pass down through families by the older generations. I still remember when I was young lad and going to visit my grandparents meant playing cards and drinking tea. For our family, playing cards is a social activity that has brought the family together over the past 27 years of my life. Sure younger card players are only going to be able to learn simple games at first, like Go Fish, which is little more than pairing numerical cards together, but as children age, they are taught more complex games like Cribbage or Rummy. 

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of playing cards is that most games that people play together socially are the same games throughout the many cultures of the world. So for a lot of card games, it is quite possible to play a card game with someone from a completely different culture and not even realize the differences the two of you may have. It’s even right bizarre when you find yourself playing cards with someone that doesn’t even speak the same language as yourself, but you find that there is no hesitation in either of your game play. The main reason that so many people play cards throughout the world is because the cost of purchasing your own deck is so little that everyone is capable of playing. In these ways, you could say that playing cards is the most inclusive hobby available throughout the world right now. 
Collecting Playing Cards Perhaps a hobby in itself, but one of the most popular aspects of playing cards has nothing to do with actually playing games. Since playing cards were first created, there have been numerous different types of deck printed throughout out the world. Although the cards are essentially the same, cards made from different companies are always unique to those companies. So in this way, whether this was intentional or not, there have been many individuals fascinated with collecting different style of playing cards. It is actually quite common for travelers to collect decks of playing cards from different casinos they visit throughout their journeys because casinos can only use a certain deck a hand full of times before they have to replace it with a new deck in order to prevent cheating. So when these cards are replaced, they are then sold as souvenirs to tourists on the way out of the casino. Another popular form of collecting playing cards is by saving specific cards from an entire deck, most commonly save card is one or both Jokers in a deck because they often have unique designs and are usually not used in most card games. 

You also have to remember that cards have been in existence for at least 1400 years, and as the cards change over those years, they become quite collectable. These vintage cards are quite rare to find, but if you do happen to find some early cards, it is quite possible for them to be worth a fair bit of money. But with all things collectable, it is not only the old that is collectable, but it is often the case of supply and demand that make things collectable. Some people will collect playing cards that feature playing cards while someone else might collect Star Wars playing cards. These types of cards are all basically the same, even to the point where it is strange not to see diamonds, hearts, clubs, and spades, but they all have different designs on the backs and it is not uncommon for the faces to be different as well. When it comes to collecting cards, it only matters what you want, and the value is dependent on what you are willing to pay. The best thing to do when if you decide to collect playing cards is to simply look up collectable playing cards on the internet to get a sense of collectability and value. It is also important to know that there are many playing card collectors in many different clubs. Two of the more popular clubs in the United States are ""The American Antiquarian Playing Card Society"", commonly known as ""52 + Joker"", and the ""English Playing Card Society."" There are clubs in Belgium, Australia, France and many more throughout the world. There are major collections that have been donated to places like the British Museum and to Yale University. 
Conclusion Playing cards is simply one of the best hobbies to get into because it is a very social activity, it safe for people of all ages, and it is probably one of the cheapest hobbies you could ever become part of. The funny part about playing cards is that so many people play different card games that they do not often think of play cards as a hobby. For most people, the first influence with playing cards began at an early age from your grandparents or parents, and as the youngest players grow up, they pass the games down onto their own children. Obviously these types of games are family friendly games, but there are also casino games that have been progressively growing in popularity, and one of the newer additions to the wide array of card games that are popular amongst University and College students is the Drinking game. These games, like the name implies, features simple card games that feature extra rules that force players to consume certain amounts of alcohol. So really, there are thousands of games that you could play, but it is very important to make sure the games being played are age appropriate. Once you get into the hobby, there really isn’t any limit to the fun you can have by playing different games, and for those creative types out there, there is no reason why you couldn’t make up your own card game.",
Psychic,"Psychic Information  Introduction Throughout history man has been fascinated with the ability to see into the unseen, know what is about to happen and communicate with beings and entities that are not found in physical form. In ancient and not so distant times entire cultures believed in the ability to have a psychic connection with angels, spirits, the deceased. Often older cultures tend to have a greater acceptance of psychic abilities while more industrialized and developed Western types of cultures tend to have less of an acceptance of the phenomenon. The study of the use of psychics in a variety of historical applications is a fascinating study starting in biblical times and proceeding through to modern rulers in the world. 

Moving objects with the power of the mind, a category of psychic ability known as pscychokinesis or telekinesis, has likewise been highly controversial but has also been researched with some very interesting findings. In recent times modern technology and popular television shows and movies have further drawn attention to the psychic phenomenon in both positive and negative lights. Psychics often are very low key about their abilities and may choose to use their enhanced perceptions and intuitions for their own personal improvement and satisfaction as opposed to making their gifts and talents public. 

Whether you believe in all forms of psychic abilities or just in the more common forms, there are ways to learn to be more observant of the visual and non-visual world around us. Enhancing your ""sixth sense"" can be a great activity that helps you in all types of things in your life. Practice and training can help individuals interested in this hobby to hone their skills and understanding of the techniques used. Some individuals within the field believe that everyone has some psychic abilities, it is just the willingness to open the mind that will determine if you can improve and enhance these abilities or not. 
Categories Of Psychic Ability There are different types of psychic ability, not all which are considered by all people to be true psychic events. Since this is not a defined science or practice most people with psychic abilities tend to be very accepting of working with others with different abilities. In general the major categories of psychic ability that are recognized universally include: 

• Aura reading - Perception of the energy fields surrounding people, places, and things. Auras can also be captured on film with specialized cameras and the readings completed from the film image. This is commonly found at psychic fairs and psychic conventions and gatherings. 

• Automatic writing - Writing content without conscious thought. 

• Astral projection - An out-of-body experience where an ""astral body"" becomes separate from a body. Astral projection is not just a psychic event, it is also used in a variety of different religions and spiritual practices in Eastern countries. Astral projection is not a physical action, it only involves mental energy levels. 

• Bilocation - Occupying two places at the same time. 

• Biofield energy healing - Healing by sending energy. 

• Clairvoyance - Perceiving things out of the known human senses. Clairvoyance is often seen as fortune telling or reading that is focused in on specific aspects of a person`s life. 

• Death-warning - A vision of a living person before they die. 

• Divination - Learning insights into a situation through a ritual. This ritual can include meditation, religious or spiritual practices, fasting rituals or other types of structured behaviors prior to the actual psychic event. 

• Dowsing - Locate objects. Dowsing for water was very popular in the United States during the settlement of the west. Some people were considered to be expert at dowsing and had very high success rates in determining where underground water could be found even in barren desert types of areas. 

• Faith healing - Diagnosing and curing diseases through faith. 

• Mediumship - Communicating with the spirits dead person. 

• Precognition, premonition, prescience, precognitive dreams, and second sight - Perceiving future events before they occur. 

• Psychic surgery - Removing diseased body tissue through an incision that immediately heals. 

• Psychokinesis or telekinesis - Manipulating matter, space, time or energy. This is perhaps the most common psychic ability in movies, television shows and in literature. 

• Retrocognition - Seeing past events. Past live experiences or historical event recreation are all components of retrocognition. 

• Telepathy, extrasensory perception through a sixth sense - also includes transferring emotions or thoughts. 

• Transvection - Flying or Body levitation. 
Psychic Reading Techniques Most people that train or develop their psychic abilities focus in on one or more reading techniques if this is the type of psychic category they are interested in. There are some people who combine different types of reading, most commonly cartomancy, reading playing cards, and the practice of reading Tarot cards. Other combinations include rune reading and numerology or lithomancy, but each of these, as with Tarot and play card readings, are different in their techniques. 

Learning how to provide readings is often completed by working with or studying under someone already proficient in providing psychic readings. A good place to find these individuals is at psychic fairs and conventions. Some psychics even offer the option of online mentoring and coaching, perfect for finding out about different techniques used in different cultures and areas of the world. 

Below are the most common types of readings found in traditional types of psychic practices in North America. In Eastern countries you may find very diverse types of readings based on a variety of cultural and religious beliefs. Studying these types of psychic practices is a very interesting hobby on its own. Often people that learn the Eastern types of what we would consider psychic abilities study for years under mentors and elders that have refined and perfected their skills. Ascending to different levels or abilities within psychic categories is often a goal of these religions and spiritual movements. These types or readings are:  
Astrology
Cartomancy or Playing Card Reading
Distant readings
Lithomancy and crystallomancy
Numerology
Palm reading
Psychometry
Rune reading
Tarot reading 
Psychic Training Options Psychic training is not something that is uncommon, there are groups, institutes, organizations and academies that offer virtually any type of psychic training you are interested in pursuing. As with any type of mental exercise most programs start with a good development of an understanding of yourself, including your thoughts, biases and opinions. Meditation is one training practice that is used almost universally in helping learners and students to clear their minds of all outside thoughts and focus their mental energy. 

Many people involved in psychic training programs stress that psychic ability is more about the knowledge of the flow of energy through the universe than it is on any specific technique or category of psychic activity. Their belief is that all elements of this world and all other worlds, dimensions or planes share the same energy. Opening your mind to watching the pattern of the energy through the system allows you to see deeper insight into the event, activity or situation. Seeing into the future, often referred to a clairvoyance or fortune telling, is simply an extension of the energy patterns along the pathways in the world. 

This projection or clairvoyance works because in training students learn to watch for the interconnectedness of all the energies of life. This can include animals, plants, the earth itself as well as all the people that inhabit this planet. This is not too different than many of the Eastern religious and spirituality. The study of yoga, chakras or energy centers in the body, meditation, structured exercises such as the 8 Golden Treasures Brocade and other structured breathing and controlled movement activities are all essential in developing this ability to sense energies around you. 

Once the learner, especially in structured types of classes and trainings, has mastered the ability to sense internal energies and is open to the ability to see patterns of energy or spirituality within the world around them then other types of training can be introduced. Many groups and trainers focus in on a particular type of psychic activity known as astral projection. This is the ability to actually see other, higher level types of energy flows with the world around you. Your physical body is not involved, it is rather the conscious movement of your mind to a different level of thinking and being. From the perspective seeing others, energy flows, the world around you and even into the future becomes much more likely. 

Other programs may focus more on learning to read specific aspects of another person. Again, this all occurs only after you are in control of your own emotions and mental abilities. Clairvoyance, reading auras, understanding chakras, interacting with spiritual guides or angels as well as reaching into past lives can all be included in these types of training. The best training programs don`t report that they will make you psychic, what they do report is that by taking their training you will maximize your potential for your own benefit. Many trainers of psychic classes believe that all people are psychic but block out the information or simply don`t know how to effectively hear, understand and use what is being provided. These trainers see their roles as guides and facilitators, not to teach being psychic as if it was something that you didn`t already have within you. 

Intuition training, which doesn`t necessarily strive to increase psychic ability but to understand your own thoughts and knowledge is considered to be a key element in many types of psychic practices and trainings. This training allows you to learn to trust your own intuition based on learning about your own knowledge and ability to make the right choices. Many people believe that the best psychics have very strong intuitive abilities and have learned to tap into their subconscious to read what is going on around them at a much deeper level. This allows them to be able to make exceptionally clear assessments, see the smallest detail in relation to the big picture and make accurate predictions about what will happen in the future based on that information that is largely missed or incorrectly processed by others. People that support intuition types of training typically don`t require that the learner or student have any pre-existing types of psychic abilities, rather they teach observation, metacognition, assessment and evaluation techniques that heighten intuitive actions and thoughts. From this heightened awareness some students may go on to discover greater psychic abilities and pursue further training. 

The internet has certainly changed the face of some of the training programs available. There are long distance training programs carried out through online webinars, streaming video presentations and group meetings in chat rooms via your home computer. These distance trainings can be a very low cost way to learn about your psychic awareness and abilities. Like any type of class you do have to participate to actually learn, and you will need to practice, complete assignments and be willing to open your mind to new possibilities to achieve your goals. 

If you don`t want to do a structured type of training or are just interesting in learning a bit more about psychic abilities then the local library or the internet may be a good place to start. There are both completely modern New Age types of books on the subject and there are very old texts and documents dating back to psychic practices in early cultures. 

DVD`s, books, online video programs, webinars and attending a psychic training are all good ways to start your own training program. Keep in mind that attending a psychic fair and spending time talking to psychics is often a great way to learn about the different categories and styles of psychic reading. It is also a great option to learn about how these individuals developed their skills and what training programs or courses they would recommend. 
Conclusion Getting started in with developing psychic abilities through meditation, spiritual awareness, guided learning, classes, or home study is a wonderful opportunity to open your mind to different possibilities. The cost of training, especially if you do it online or through books is very minimal, unlike some hobbies which are very expensive. 

While most people want to develop their psychic ability to help their own lives, there are those that can really enhance their abilities and use them to help others. Psychics can use their talents to have a small clientele that they work with, or they can participate in the psychic fairs and conventions that occur across the United States every year. Those that have a true gift for helping others, providing healing, insight or information may even find another career opportunity looming in their future.",
Modern Dance,"Modern Dance Information  Introduction Dance has been described as the “wedding of movement to music.” Dance may be the oldest form of human communication. Men and women have always danced, for one reason or another: ritual, celebration, recreation, or entertainment. Every culture and social group has its own forms of dance, ranging from the leaps and turns of classical ballet to the stylized patterns of square dances, the elegant steps of ballroom dancing to the freeform gyrations at high school proms, break dancing to Irish step dancing. 

Dance can be an enjoyable form of social interaction, a way to get exercise and meet people. Many people take up dancing for a hobby. Classes and dance groups are available for many types of dancing, from folk dancing to ballroom dancing, ballet, or modern dance. Modern dance was developed in the 20th century as a reaction to the formality of classical ballet; it tends to be loose, experimental, individualistic, and creative. If you have been longing to express yourself through dance, to make dance into a form of artistic expression, modern dance would be a good choice.  
What is Modern Dance? Modern dance is a form of theatrical dance that developed in the early 20th century in the United States and Europe, as a protest against the rigidity of classical ballet and other interpretive dance forms of the time. Like modern art and modern music, modern dance is experimental and iconoclastic, a reaction to the constraints of traditional art forms. 

In the early 1900s the American dancers Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis and the German dancer Mary Wigman started to rebel against the rigid constraints of Classical Ballet. Shedding the authoritarian controls surrounding classical ballet technique, costume, and shoes, these early modern dance pioneers focused on creative self-expression rather than on technical virtuosity. 

While many influences went into the development of modern dance, American dancer Isadora Duncan is the person usually credited with the creation of the modern dance movement. Trained in ballet, but wanting to express herself as an artist, Duncan found that the formal movements of ballet did not allow her to express herself fully. Duncan believed that dance should be the divine expression of the human spirit, and that the techniques of ballet distorted the natural movements of the body. She felt that ballet dancers resembled puppets, and took her inspirations from the movements of nature, from the wind among others. In a nonconformist gesture, she threw out the conventional ballet steps and created a spontaneous and highly personal form of dance that allowed her to express her inner spirit. While ballerinas danced in tight toe shoes, Duncan danced barefoot, in simple, flowing costumes. Because her art form was so personal, the new dance form could not be passed on to the next generation through training, but Duncan’s work inspired younger dancers to express themselves in a similar fashion, beginning the artistic movement that we know as modern dance. 

Modern dance is a more relaxed, free style of dance in which choreographers use emotions and moods to design their own steps, in contrast to ballet`s structured code of steps. It has a deliberate use of gravity, whereas ballet strives to be light and airy. 
I want to learn Modern Dance, where do I start?
Tips for the Beginner If you are interested in learning modern dance, there are many resources available, from DVDs and online tutorials, to books and classes. 

• Find a dance studio or class and take lessons. Look in the telephone book, yellow pages, or online to find a dance studio in your area that offers modern dance lessons. If you have a junior college or local university, check to see if they offer dance classes. Many colleges have non-credit courses for local residents at reasonable fees. Another source for lessons is your local recreation center or community learning center. These lessons are often less expensive, and can be found in beginner through expert levels. 

• Buy or rent a video. You can purchase a modern dance video that offers step-by-step instruction online or in your local video store. If possible, rent the video first to make sure that it is the one for you. There are also videos available on dance websites or on YouTube. 

• Hire a private teacher. If you cannot find a class, or if you are particularly serious about wanting to learn, you can hire a personal modern dance instructor. This is the most costly option, but you can get individualized coaching and instructions. 

• Look online. You can consult the Internet for local dance groups. Resources like Craigslist are good sites for finding interest groups. 
Basic Steps in Modern Dance Modern dance was developed by classically trained ballet dancers who wanted to explore and enjoy dance outside the rigid constraints of classical ballet. They wanted to humanize the dance moves, to show emotion—sorrow, joy, anguish, frustration, yearning. Modern dance was a very creative and innovative art form, and the steps evolved with each dancer who explored the dance form. As a dancer in this tradition, you, too, will be able to contribute to the art form that is modern dance. 

The particular technique you learn when you begin classes will depend on your teacher. Since modern dance is such an individualistic and creative genre, students can learn great variations in the craft by studying under different instructors. Despite this, however, there are some basic movements and techniques that are taught universally in modern dance studios. 

• Curl Down and Up: Start with feet parallel and facing front and arms at your sides (this is known as jazz first position). Curl your spine over slowly, one vertebra at a time. Bend your knees when you are halfway down, and continue the curl downward. When you reach the floor, “grow” back upwards, one vertebra at a time. Do not collapse at the waist. 

• Flat Back: A flat back takes a certain amount of discipline and flexibility. Bend over, keeping your spine as straight as possible, and raise your arms high overhead with palms facing inward. Raise your torso back up, simultaneously raising the arms in a single movement. This movement is graceful and controlled, reminiscent of ballet. 

• Side twists: Sit on the floor with one leg bent in towards the groin and the other crossed over with the foot flat on the floor. Arms are at shoulder height. Lifting from the waist, twist the opposite arm toward the crossed knee, turning the torso. Grasp the outside of the crossed-over knee with the opposite arm, and place the other arm on your lower back. Gently pull the front arm to twist further. This is similar to the Yoga position also known as the Twist. 

• Tendu: In Tendu, start with feet parallel in first position. Point the foot forward and back. Repeat the position to the side, and then to the back. • Chasse: The Chasse is a simple jump and is common in modern dance. Stand with the weight on one foot, then shift the weight while in a ballet plié stance. Then jump so both feet are vertical together in the air. This movement can be used to travel across the floor. You can add height and a spin to the jump for a more advanced maneuver. 

No Boundaries 

All modern dance steps have been derived from something else, either a classical ballet move, an everyday body movement, or a movement in nature. Modern dancers use the movements they witness in everyday life to create choreography moves. Don’t be afraid to create your own dance steps, to express your experiences, your moods, and feelings using choreography. You can tell your own story through the medium of modern dance. 
Benefits of Dance In a modern dance class, you will be working on body awareness, harmonizing your mind and body, coming into tune with your inner sense of balance and rhythm. Modern dance allows you to express yourself through the movement of your body. It improves flexibility and fitness levels, improves coordination and tone, and even sharpens musical skills. Dance practice can be an intense workout, and you will increase your strength and stamina by regular practice. In addition, a dance workout can be relaxing and exhilarating, increasing endorphins and relieving stress. 
History of Modern Dance
Free Dance Free dance is a 20th century dance form that preceded modern dance. Rebelling against the rigid constraints of classical ballet, dancers and choreographers in Europe and America began to search for new forms of artistic expression. The impetus for this movement began in the late 1890s in the United States, with three women. 

In 1891, Loie Fuller (a burlesque skirt dancer) began experimenting with the effect that gas lighting had on her silk costumes. Fuller developed a form of natural movement and improvisation techniques that were used in conjunction with her revolutionary lighting equipment and translucent silk costumes. She patented her apparatus and methods of stage lighting that included the use of colored gels and burning chemicals for luminescence, and also patented her voluminous silk stage costumes. 

In 1903, Isadora Duncan developed a dance technique influenced by the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and a belief that the dance of the ancient Greeks (natural and free) was the dance of the future. Duncan developed a philosophy of dance based on natural and spiritual concepts and advocated for that acceptance of pure dance as a high art. 

Then, in 1905, Ruth St. Denis, influenced by the actor Sarah Bernhardt and Japanese dancer Sada Yacco, developed her translations of Indian culture and mythology. Her performances quickly became popular and she toured extensively whilst researching Oriental culture and arts. 

Fuller, Duncan and St. Denis all toured Europe seeking a wider and more accepting audience for their work. Ruth St. Denis returned to the United States to continue her work. Isadora Duncan returned to the United States at various points in her life but her work was not very well received there. She returned to Europe and died in Paris in 1927. Fuller`s work also received little support outside Europe.  
Early Modern Dance Isadora Duncan’s philosophy of self-expression and her concern for the inner motivation of the dancer inspired the dancers and choreographers who followed her. The romantic, stylized themes of classical ballet gave way to primitive, earthy portrayals of the deepest conflicts and passions of the human soul. These dancers tried to develop a more natural, expressive form of movement. After shedding the techniques and compositional methods of their teachers the early modern dancers developed their own methods and ideologies and dance techniques that became the foundation for modern dance practice. 

Martha Graham viewed the back and the pelvis as the center of all movement, and concentrated on the center of the body rather than the arms and legs in her dance movements. Doris Humphrey saw the basis of movement as an interplay between falling and recovering, between loss of balance and return to balance. Instead of defying gravity with leaps and twirls, modern dancers stayed close to the floor, falling, kneeling, and crouching, emphasizing the force of gravity. Most early modern dance works expressed the struggles of the dancer, his or her passion and emotion. While ballet dancers try to make their dance appear effortless, modern dancers emphasized the pain and struggle that made up a dance, as well as a life. 

In 1927 newspapers regularly began assigning dance critics, such as Walter Terry, and Edwin Denby, who approached performances from the viewpoint of a movement specialist rather than as a reviewer of music or drama. Educators accepted modern dance into college and university curricula, first as a part of physical education, then as performing art. Many college teachers were trained at the Bennington Summer School of the Dance, which was established at Bennington College in 1934.  
Expressionist Dance (Europe) In Europe, the modern dance movement took the form of Expressionist dance. Expressionist dance is a European dance form related to the German expressionist movement. Although considered as a part of the greater modern dance movement it is separate from Modern dance per se. German Expressionist dance is known as Ausdruckstanz . 

`Expressionism` was a cultural movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the start of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world under an utterly subjective perspective, violently distorting it to obtain an emotional effect and vividly transmit personal moods and ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of ""being alive"" and emotional experience rather than physical reality. Expressionism often dealt with emotional turmoil and suffering, and stressed individual self-expression and the inner workings of the mind as opposed to depictions of the outer world. 

Dance artists associated with expressionist dance in Europe include Mary Wigman, Francois Delsarte, Emile Jacques-Dalcroze, and Rudolf von Laban. These people developed theories of human movement and expression, and methods of instruction that led to the development of European modern and Expressionist dance. Their theories and techniques spread well beyond Europe to influence the development of modern dance and theater via their students and disciples, and subsequent generations of teachers and performers carried these theories and methods to Russia, the United States and Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand. 

Modern dance was dominated by the Expressionist movement for several decades, until the 1940s, when an American choreographer, Merce Cunningham, spearheaded a revolt that led to the next trend in the modern dance movement.  
Radical Dancers By the end of World War II, a modern dance “establishment”, based on the works of Graham, Fuller, and the European Expressionists, and others, had come into being. At this point, young choreographers began looking for ways to once again break the rules: creating dances that had no theme, expressed no emotion, and sought different means of expression through movement. 

Beginning in the 1940s, one of Graham’s students, Merce Cunningham, led a growing reaction against Expressionism. Cunningham wanted to create dance for its own sake, not for the sake of storytelling, emotional expression, or social commentary. Cunningham’s dance was concerned with movement, rhythm, phrasing, and structure. He believed that movement should define its own space and rhythms, and that the set and the music should be secondary. He also believed that all movement was potential dance material. He incorporated everyday acts such as sitting down and walking into his routines. With Cunningham, modern dance regained some of the light, airy quality of ballet, with intricate footwork and high and controlled leg extensions, and an emphasis once again on the vertical dimension. While Martha Graham’s works were structured around events in a story, Cunningham’s works centered around one or more choreographic ideas; the audience was left to provide a context and story line to the work. “Emotion will appear,” he maintained, “when the movement is danced, because that is where the life is.” 

Whilst the founders of modern dance continued to make works based on ancient myths and legends following a narrative structure, their students, the radical dancers, saw dance as a potential agent of change. Disturbed by the Great Depression and the rising threat of fascism in Europe, they tried to raise consciousness by dramatizing the economic, social, ethnic and political crises of their time.  
Postmodern and Contemporary Dance Both Postmodern dance and Contemporary dance are built upon the foundations laid by Modern dance and form part of the greater category of 20th century concert dance. Whereas Postmodern dance was a direct and opposite response to Modern dance, Contemporary dance draws on both modern and postmodern dance as a source of inspiration. 

The social and artistic upheavals of the late 1960s and 70s provoked even more radical forms of modern dance. Modern dance today is much more sophisticated in technique and technology than when modern dance was founded. The founders composed their dances entirely of spirit, soul, heart and mind as opposed to today`s modern which has more technical aspects. The concern with social problems and the condition of human spirit is still expressed, but the issues that are presented would have appalled many early modern dancers. 

Twyla Tharp eliminated sound accompaniment altogether, feeling that it might distract the viewer’s attention from the dance itself. In addition, she performed in unorthodox venues, such as the staircase of New York’s Metropolitan Museum. Dancer Steve Paxton added mundane actions such as dressing and undressing into his routines, and even performed a dance duet with a chicken. Like other pop artists of the 1960s and 70s, these dancers were attempting to break down the barriers between dancers and audience, between art and life. 

The essence of modern dance is to look forward, not back. Ballet and modern sometimes fuse together and enrich both forms, but neither is likely to lose its identity in the process. It is impossible to predict what directions modern dance will take in the future. Each style could go in so many different directions and are usually very radical. If this trend keeps up, future audiences can look forward to an interesting forum of dance. 
Conclusion Modern dance is a creative offshoot of traditional ballet, a revolt against the formal structure of classical ballet. In modern dance, self-expression, portrayal of strong emotion, and individual creativity are stressed. If you are looking for a personal form of artistic self-expression through movement, modern dance may be the hobby for you. There are online resources, dance groups, and classes available. Whatever your age or skill level, this creative and innovative art holds something for you.",
Table Tennis - Ping Pong,"Table Tennis - Ping Pong Information  Introduction Table tennis is one of those sports that reaches across cultural backgrounds and socio-economic status and appeals to people from all walks of life. It is one of those unique sports that doesn’t require a person to have an opponent to play against in order to improve his or her abilities, or to have fun. One need only to simply raise the other half of the table and hit against the wall that is created. 

Of course, just as with any sport, table tennis is much more fun to play against someone. Though the playing surface is actually quite small compared to other sports, in major and fierce competition, players can find themselves running around, back and forth, quite often, chasing the ball down and attempting to seize the advantage in the game. 

If you have never watched even five minutes of a serious, professional table tennis competition, then it is recommended that you do as you will see just how much skill can go into becoming a great champion. 

For the rest of us, however, those of us who only want to learn to play table tennis as a hobby with family and friends, it is also one of those unique sports that doesn’t require a great deal of skill or talent to play. One simply only needs to be able to hold a small paddle and hit the ping pong ball back across the exceedingly short net separating the two sides. 

Of course, on the serve, a person must first hit the ball onto their side of the table and then have it bounce on his or her opponent’s side in order to be a good and successful serve. Every other shot after the serve must only bounce on the opponent’s side of the table. 

For most recreational play, that is the crux of playing table tennis. For those who are looking for just a little bit more, let’s take a deeper stroll into the world of table tennis.  
Overview Table Tennis, also known as ping-pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight, hollow ball back and forth using table tennis rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, players must allow a ball played toward them only one bounce on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side. Points are scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. A skilled player can impart several varieties of spin to the ball, altering its trajectory and limiting an opponent`s options to great advantage. 

Table tennis is controlled by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 210 member associations. The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITFF handbook. Since 1988, table tennis has been an Olympic sport, with several event categories. In particular, from 1988 until 2004, these were: men`s singles, women`s singles, men`s doubles and women`s doubles. Since 2008 the doubles have been replaced by the team events. 
Equipment Whether played for fun or competition, table tennis players need paddles, a table, balls and a net. Beginners are advised to buy quality equipment because it lasts longer and performs consistently. But a novice player should keep in mind his or her level of skills and playing style when buying equipment. Quality equipment is desired, but there’s no reason for a casual player to pay top dollar for gear that will be used just for playing for fun with friends. 

The best table tennis equipment, and the widest selection, is available by mail order and online. Local sporting goods stores and mass retailers sell a limited collection of tennis table equipment, but the gear is typically of lesser quality. Ping pong enthusiasts are advised to check out Internet sites or ask veteran players about reputable dealers in table tennis equipment. 

No special clothing is needed for playing ping pong. Players generally wear dark, solid colors. Do not wear running shoes or any shoes geared mainly for forward motions when playing table tennis. Wear shoes that allow rapid movement while easily controlling the ankles. 

Orange is the most popular color for table tennis balls, although white is also used. The hue of the table and surroundings is what influences the choice of ball color. Most people find orange balls are the easiest to spot in most lighting conditions. 

The quality of ping pong balls is denoted by the number of imprinted stars. Three stars mark the best quality balls, which are used for official table tennis competitions. 

The quality of balls influences the cost. Expect to pay $1 for a decent tennis table ball, but balls bought in bulk are often cheaper. 

Ping pong balls are hollow and weigh 2.7 grams with a diameter of 44 millimeters, according to international rules. The balls are made of celluloid filled with air. 

Keep ping pong balls clean and store them inside a case. Players at all levels should be aware that table tennis balls are highly flammable and must be kept away from open flames and direct heat. 

Ping pong tables are 9 feet long, 5 feet wide and 30 inches high. Or 2.74 meters long, 1.525 meters wide and 76 centimeters high. The tables are wooden with a smooth, low-friction coating. Tables are divided in half by a net that is 6 inches high, or 15.25 centimeters high. Green or blue tables are sanctioned by the International Table Tennis Federation. 

When playing or practicing, keep roughly 8 feet of space cleared all around the ping pong table. 

There’s a wide variety of ping pong tables on the market today. The best quality ping pong tables cost approximately $1,000. About $500 will buy a decent and durable ping pong table. Lower quality tables can be purchased at sporting goods stores and mass retailers for around $150. 

Nets can be bought separately or as part of the ping pong table set. A tournament quality net can run as high as $100 if purchased separately. 

Don’t store ping pong tables outside because condensation and moisture can mar the flat surface. And don’t pile items on top of ping pong tables. Table tennis paddles are made of laminated wood covered with rubber. The main body of the paddle is called the blade. The playing surface is called the rubber. Paddles are also referred to as racquets or bats. 

The wooden portion of a paddle must comprise at least 85 percent natural wood. Cork, glass fiber, arylate, Kevlar, carbon fiber and aluminum fiber also are used in the manufacture of ping pong paddles. But the rubber cannot touch any part of the paddle that is non-wood. The paddle is not eligible for tournament play if the rubber touches non-wood surfaces. 

Blades have ratings that describe their characteristics, such as speed. A paddle’s speed is determined by the combined characteristics of the blade and the rubber. 

Fast blades are not recommended for beginning players. Slow blades allow for greater control and are recommended for defensive players. Medium blades allow good ball control and a decent topspin. 

A scale of 1 to 10 is used to gauge the speed and spin of a rubber. A 10 rating is the fastest and also denotes the most spin. 

Each side of the paddle is covered with a different surface to allow variations on spin and speed. Players perform different types of return by flipping over the paddle during games. 

International rules call for one side of the paddle to be covered in black rubber and the other side to be covered with red rubber. This allows players to distinguish the different types of rubber used by a competitor. Players are permitted to examine their opponent’s paddle before a game. The rubber can be pimpled or inverted. Pimpled rubber is dotted with cylindrical bumps that make an uneven striking surface well suited for defensive players. Offensive players rarely use a pimpled rubber as their primary surface for play. 

Inverted rubber is smooth and enables a wide variety of spins and attacking techniques. Beginners are advised to use inverted or smooth rubber as their primary surface for learning ping pong. Beginners should not use a rubber that has a lot of spin. 

There’s no official restriction on face size or shape, but paddles are commonly about 6.5 inches long and 6 inches wide, or 16.5 centimeters long and 15 centimeters wide. 

The cost of decent paddle is about $50. A paddle for intermediate or advanced play will cost from $100 to $200. Basic rubbers average about $25. 

Blades should be handled with gentle care. Clean the rubber with a sponge moistened with water after a game. Store paddles in a plastic bag and inside a protective case. 

Players can augment their table tennis gear with miscellaneous accessories like rubber cleaners and special shoes. But beginners are advised to make sure they are committed to staying with ping pong before spending money on such accessories. 
The Grip Competitive table tennis players grip their rackets in a variety of ways. One is described as penhold, and the other shakehand.  
Penhold The penhold grip is so-named because one grips the racket similarly to the way one holds a writing instrument. The most popular style, usually referred to as the Chinese penhold style, involves curling the middle, ring, and fourth finger on the back of the blade. Traditionally, penhold players use only one side of the racket to hit the ball during normal play, and the side which is in contact with the last three fingers is generally not used.  
Shakehand The shakehand grip is so-named because one grips the racket similarly to the way one performs a handshake. The grip is sometimes referred to as the ""tennis grip"" or the ""Western grip,"" . Today, however, the shakehand grip is being encouraged over the penhold grip even in some East Asian table tennis establishments, due to its simplicity and versatility compared to the penhold grip. 
Strokes
Offensive Strokes Speed drive strokes differ to ones from other racket sports like tennis. The racket is primarily perpendicular to the direction of the stroke, and most of the energy applied to the ball results in speed rather than spin, creating a shot that does not arc much, but is fast enough that it can be difficult to return. 

The loop drive is essentially the reverse of the speed drive. The racket is much more parallel to the direction of the stroke and grazes the ball, resulting in a large amount of topspin. 

The counter drive is usually a counter attack against drives. You have to close the racket and stay close to the ball. The racket is held closed and near to the ball, which is hit with a short movement ""off the bounce"" (before reaching the highest point) so that the ball travels faster to the other side. 

A player will typically execute a smash when his or her opponent has returned a ball that bounces too high and/or too close to the net. Smashing is essentially self-explanatory—large backswing and rapid acceleration imparting as much speed on the ball as possible.  
Defensive Strokes The push (or slice in Asia) is usually used for keeping the point alive and creating offensive opportunities. A push resembles a tennis slice: the racket cuts underneath the ball, imparting backspin and causing the ball to float slowly to the other side of the table. 

A chop or cut is the defensive, backspin counterpart to the offensive loop drive. A chop is essentially a bigger, heavier slice, taken well back from the table. The racket face points primarily horizontally, perhaps a little bit upward, and the direction of the stroke is straight down. 

The block or short is a simple shot, barely worthy of being called a ""stroke,"" but nonetheless can be devastating against an attacking opponent. A block is executed by simply putting the racket in front of the ball—the ball rebounds back toward the opponent. 

The kill spin is a new shot that is played only when the ball bounces low just on the other side of the net. To play the shot, you must stand at the side of the table, open your bat angle, and bend your arm, then, you as lightly and as softly as possible just touch the ball over the net and bring your bat back slightly. 

The defensive high ball or lob is possibly the visually most impressive shot in the sport of table tennis, and it is deceptive in its simplicity. To execute a High Ball, a defensive player first backs off the table 4–6 meters; then, the stroke itself consists of simply lifting the ball to an enormous height before it falls back to the opponent`s side of the table. 

The drop shot is a high level stroke, used as another variation for close-to-table strokes. You have to position the racket close to the ball and just let the ball touch it (without any hand movement) in a way that the ball stays close to the net with almost no speed and spin and touches the other side of the table more than twice if the opponent doesn`t reach it. 

The topspin is a spin shot that can be used as a powerful spike or just getting the ball on the other player`s side of the table. To do this shot you must slightly touch the top of the ball with the racket. 
Digging in: Joining a League or Going Solo Understanding the rules of any game is one of the most important first steps to having fun. Without rules, problems will inevitably arise from one player not being pleased with something that has transpired, or giving an unfair advantage to another person. 

The basic rules in table tennis are as follows: 

The two players decide on who serves first. This can be done with a coin toss, playing for the first serve, or having one playing hide the ball in his or her hand under the table and having his or her opponent guess which hand it is in. 

The player serving must toss the ball at least six inches in the air and then strike it before it hits the table or the ground. The serve must hit the server’s side of the table first, and then the opponent’s side. All other shots can only hit the opponent’s side of the table. 

Serves are alternated every two serves, regardless of who wins the point. The first player to reach 11 points winning by 2 wins the game. 

Now, the decision about whether to play for fun and try to recruit some friends and family to play on a regular or semi-regular basis, or to seek out a club to join will depend largely on what you want to get out of playing table tennis. Some people simply love the act of competing and will place themselves in the middle of competition whenever possible. Other people will prefer to keep competition out of the mix and would rather have fun with friends and family. 

Within most communities there are table tennis groups that offer a wide range of skill levels to match up with, however. There will be the seasoned professionals (okay, not quite professional, but those who take their sport very seriously) who will prefer to be matched up against other players who can keep up with them and give them a good game. There will also be beginners who are just starting out learning the sport. In between, there will be all other levels of players as well. 

Most people don’t realize that there are such groups as table tennis groups, but this is largely due to the fact that it isn’t considered a very popular sport when compared to other activities, such as baseball, football, soccer, and more. 

If, for some reason, you are unable to find a group a people with whom to play table tennis in your community, then contact your local recreation department and see if you might be able to begin one at their facility. Then you can post an advertisement in the newspaper or online looking for like-minded table tennis aficionados. 
Learning To Play Beginners should find a coach to help them learn table tennis. A ping pong coach can be found at a tennis table club. Or novice players can find a practice partner by recruiting an acquaintance that is skilled at the game. Beginners should initially focus on developing their skills and honing their game during frequent practice sessions with a coach or practice partner. 

The Internet is a good source for locating table tennis facilities and clubs. But there are other spots that can be checked out for finding playing facilities. These include fraternal clubs like the Elks, community colleges and high schools, recreation centers, public parks, gyms and sports centers, bars and pool halls, hotels, and churches. Also contact chambers of commerce to find playing sites for table tennis, or refer to municipal phone directories. 

The rapid-fire movements needed for table tennis require players to warm up before playing a game. Players often loosen their muscles prior to games by jogging, jumping rope or stretching. 
Tips and Tricks
Holding the racket How you hold the racket will determine the kinds of spin that you can put on the ball while playing. Some players prefer the handshake grip while others like the idea of the pen grip, each for a different reason. 

How you hold the racket will allow you to spin the ball a little bit differently. Developing spin is an integral aspect in winning table tennis, especially against more skilled opponents. 

There are two basic types of spin: topspin and backspin. Each will produce a different effect when the ball sails through the air, curving it in one direction or another, or having it snap down on the opponent’s side of the table quicker (topspin). The spin will also determine how high or how fast the ball will bounce once it hits the table. 

You can also develop a side spin that will cause the ball to move laterally in the air. The table tennis ball is light and that means it will react more severely to extreme spin, so the harder you spin the ball, the more it will move and the more it will react when it bounces off of the table. 

Spinning the ball takes time and practice to master. Since the table is relatively small and the speed of the racket needs to be faster than one would normally hit the ball in order to generate effective spin, then it’s important to expect that there will be many shots that go wayward as you get used to spinning it.  
Positioning around the table When you’re playing a game against novices, most people tend to stand relatively close to the table, yet when you play against more accomplished and skilled players, you should stand back a couple of feet as the ball will be coming at you much faster, and with more spin. Standing away from the table will also allow you to gain a full swing and spin the ball much more effectively, giving you a little extra room for error. 

You will find, however, that with less experienced players, you will be forced to stay close to the table as many of their shots will fall short and won’t have the pace to reach even the end of the table, let alone two feet beyond it. 

Some of the world’s best players stand back several feet and create enormous amounts of spin. 
Putting Together Your Own Tournament When you begin to play table tennis, or you rediscover your love of this exciting and fun game, then the more you talk about with your friends and peers, the more you will realize how many people share the same interest as you in table tennis. 

In time you will discover that your friends, coworkers, and people whom you talk to at your local tavern, are all interested in playing table tennis. Many of them will opine about not having their own table or wishing that they could come over to your house and show you just how good they are at playing table tennis. 

There is an excellent opportunity to put them all to the proverbial test. That’s right. After all, people love competition, from the young kid down the street to the retired Army Colonel, they all like to compete, even if the ultimate prize is just fun. 

But you can do more than bring them some recreation and excitement; you could create a table tennis tournament with something at stake. Something, for example, like money or a trip to the movies for two, or even dinner at a nice restaurant. 

All you need to do is have some imagination and creativity. And get people to buy into the tournament. If they want to play, charge them ten dollars, or twenty. Make sure you don’t pocket the money yourself, or you’ll have people not returning for a second tournament. Put the money toward equipment, food, and prizes. 

You can set this tournament to be played over the course of several weeks, or –if you have enough tables- over one weekend. A table tennis tournament that you put together can be a great time had by all. 
Frequently Asked Questions What kind of racket should I get? 

There are a couple of different types of rackets to choose from when it comes to table tennis. The most common is the soft, smooth foam covering and the other kind is a harder foam covering with dimples on it. Each will produce basically the same effect, but for beginners, the smooth foam one is more forgiving. 

The best thing to do is go to a store that sells table tennis rackets and try a couple of them out. For the most part, the weight and feel will be the same, so it will all depend on what you find most comfortable for you. 

I don’t have a lot of room in my home. Can I still get a table? 

Most modern home recreation tables can fold up and be stored in minimal space. There are also multi-game tables that can be used for many different purposes, such as pool and foosball. There are even table for table tennis that can be used as a dining room or kitchen table if turned upside down. 

In this day and age of modern technology, there are few things that are not possible because of space issues. If you want to play table tennis but are worried about space, simply do a quick search of table tennis tables on the Internet and you will be able to find a number of options to suit your needs and space. 

I have been playing recreationally for years, what does it take to play competitively? 

If by ‘competitively’ you mean in tournaments, it doesn’t take much at all. It depends on the type of tournament that you’re interested in in the first place. If you’re looking for officially sanctioned tournaments, you will likely need to join a league and obtain a membership. From there, you will compete and earn points and ranking through each victory that you have. 

If you are looking for something a little less formal, then you can likely find a number of groups in the area that gather and play tournament style table tennis for fun. They are known to put together simple tournaments and offer some basic prizes. 

I haven’t played since I was a kid and I was wondering if I could still play. 

Table tennis is not an exclusive sport to children. In fact, many adults from around the world play competitively everyday. Some even make a living off of their winnings from table tennis tournaments. 

My racket is old and the rubber surface is worn out: can I still use it? 

Sure. But why would you want to? New table tennis rackets are not that expensive and will make playing the game easier as it will allow you to spin the ball more effectively and consistently. A new racket will go a long way toward bringing you more fun and excitement in playing table tennis. 
Conclusion While the Chinese seem to dominate the sport from a professional standpoint, that doesn’t mean that us mere mortals can’t enjoy this fun and exciting sporting activity with friends and family, or even in a more competitive environment ourselves. 

Of course, the odds that you are going to become a master of the sport and take over the world rankings is not likely, but that shouldn’t get you down. Table tennis offers us all the opportunity to get a little exercise, have some fun, and improve a little bit more each time we pick up a racket. 

That makes it a winner in most books and ultimately, winning isn’t the only thing to be concerned about; but it’s a nice thing, too.",
Car Collecting,"Car Collecting InformationINTRODUCTION TO CLASSIC CAR COLLECTINGFew people miss a classic car when it drives by. The unmistakable styling and the grin on the face of the driver are sure to draw attention wherever the car might be. Classic car collecting is not just about how many cars you have or which cars you have, it is about the connection you have with each vehicle. A classic car collector is a collector of history, of stories. Each vehicle has a tale to tell and the collector`s responsibility is to help share that story.Classic car collections require a lot of work. From turning an old beater into a showpiece to maintaining the vehicle, a classic car collector can choose to spend a few hours a week or a few hours a day preparing their vehicles for show.Ask anyone who was around when these cars were first released, and you will no doubt hear a story about Mr. Dan`s Cadillac 12 or Rob`s 1967 Chevy Camaro. Classic and Antique cars have a way of starting conversations and connecting people from different generations. Jay Leno, an avid collector of classic cars, claims he will buy a car simply for the story behind the car.The definition of a Classic Car varies from club to club and owner to owner. You might argue that your 1987 Bostonian Edition Mercury Cougar is a classic, while someone else might say your car is just an 80s cougar with a kit. As you begin your Classic Car collection, do your homework. Study the definitions of classic and antique cars. If a car`s status as a classic is unclear and you really love the car, why not get it? It may become a classic one day.So, now you are ready to learn about one of the most exciting hobbies around. As you begin, make sure you do your research. Many of the classic and antique cars are already found. Keep an open mind as you hunt for your cars or you might just miss the Dodge Charger in your quest for a Plymouth Barracuda.History of CollectingCollections vary in size. You might have two items or two thousand items. Regardless of what you are collecting, the approach is similar. You are on a quest to find something you are passionate about in an attempt to preserve it for future enjoyment. If you collect items like antiques, artwork, or vehicles, do not be surprised if your collecting hobby becomes very costly, very quickly. Due to the popularity of these hobbies, the value assigned to these collectibles is higher than, say, a postage stamp or matchbox car collection.HISTORY OF CLASSIC CARSDefinitions of Classic & Antique CarsYour car collecting hobby will no doubt include much debate over what is and isn`t qualified as a classic car. The cutoff for a classic or antique varies by club and country. Regardless of what you think your car is, make sure your vehicle meets the requirements of the club or group running any motor vehicle show before you shell out cash to bring your car.Antique Cars1900sThe turn of the century was an exciting time in car history. Perhaps the most important vehicle of all time was manufactured during this decade. The Ford Model T changed global manufacturing. Henry Ford and his brilliant assembly line design made car production less expensive, faster, and far more efficient. In a similar burst of innovation, the Cadillac Model K introduced the use of standardized car parts.1910sThe 1910s tore away from the less powerful 6-cylinder engines and experimented with larger, more powerful engines. The Packard Twin Six offered a luxurious 12-cylinder engine for unparalleled power and a smooth drive. The 1915 Cadillac V-8 Type 51 offered a highly styled body and a powerful V-8 engine.1920sIn the 1920s, the unit body construction of modern cars was introduced. Vehicles designed and built during this decade include the Chrysler Model B-70, the Auburn Speedster, and the 1927 LaSalle. While these vehicles are now close to one hundred years old, there are still many hidden away across the country. During this decade, annual vehicle sales averaged 5 million cars. Compare this to around 3 million a year during the Great Depression.1930sDuring the 1930s, vehicles became both streamlined and compact. Manufacturers experimented with front wheel drive, independent suspension systems, and 5-cylinder radial motors. As a result, the Cadillac 8, Cadillac 12, Cadillac 16, Buick Roadmaster, and the 1935 Dodge Caravan were manufactured. These cars were well made and developed into models that are still manufactured now. For example, the Buick Roadmaster was in production until 1992 and the Dodge Caravan is one of the most popular minivans on the market.Classic Cars1940sDuring World War II, many car manufacturers ceased production of motor vehicles and turned to plane manufacturing. During this period of time, the vehicles that were manufactured were made to be both practical and durable. An excellent example is the 1949 Oldsmobile Station Wagon.1950sAfter the war, designers went a little crazy. Some of the cars on the road looked more like spaceships than cars. The “Fabulous Fifties” included fantasy vehicles galore. The sleek designed featured large quantities of chrome and a myriad of accessories. Wrapped, single piece windshields became popular and are still used in modern vehicles. The 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air, the 1957 Chrysler Diablo, the Cadillac Eldorado, and the Ford Thunderbird are all excellent examples of the huge shift in design that took place during this decade.1960sThe 1960s brought muscle cars to the masses. These were the most powerful, attractive vehicles around. The classic styling of the Ford Mustang, Dodge Charger, and Chevrolet Camaro filled the dreams of almost every car enthusiast. While the 1960s were not filled solely with muscle cars, they do come to mind first. Another vehicle that stands out during this period of time is the Lincoln Continental. Car manufacturers also produced a myriad of compact cars for the general public.1970sThe oil crisis resulted in an increase in compact car production and a drop in the popularity of vehicles that were far less fuel efficient. The Ford Bronco and the Plymouth Barracuda were only a hint of what was to come in the 1980s. The 1970s include the last of what can be classified as a Classic Car today. However, a Classic Car is more than 20 years old. Soon, the 1980s will be included in the Classic Car group.1980sWhile these cars are not yet on the books as Classics, there are a few standout models that collectors are holding on to until they become classics. These models include the Dodge Lancer Shelby, The Mercury Cougar XR-7, the Honda Prelude, and the Lincoln Continental Mark VII LSC.HOW TO BEGIN A COLLECTIONResearch, research, research. It doesn`t matter that you prefer the styling of the 1910s or the sexiness of the 1960s, if you haven`t conducted extensive research you will not know what to look for or what anything is worth. Building a great collection takes time, patience, and creativity. The more cautious approach described below is perfect for classic car collecting.Ready, Set, Research!Organization is key to building and maintaining your collection. In this section we will cover a few suggestions, from researching car possibilities to showing off your collection.You can find local car shows or order magazines online. Your best resource when starting out will be fellow collectors at small shows. Not only will you have time to talk to them, you can get a better idea of what you will need to do to start your collection on the right foot. Who knows, you might find your first car while you are wandering around.There are endless numbers of car clubs in the United States. Many clubs specialize in a particular makes or models like Corvette Clubs or Pontiac Clubs. Others focus on a decade or a group of vehicles, like the 1950s or Antique Cars only. You can find a club in your area that specializes in your type of collection by doing some online research.Determine Your Classic CarAs soon as a new car leaves the lot, it isn`t worth what you paid for it. However, classic and antique cars are special as they increase in value if properly maintained. For example, a car that cost $1000 in 1930 is worth at least ten times that in today`s market. You can have your vehicle appraised by a dealer or a club. The following information provides an explanation of the theory behind the value of a collectible item. If you plan to sell parts of your collection, you may choose to research its value in the classic car market before you invest your time and money into the car.Classic Cars And The World Wide WebMany transactions take place over the internet. From parts to vehicle sales, the internet is an excellent place to access vehicles all over the country and the world. Research is more simple and online forums allow you to have conversations with your fellow classic car collectors around the world. Take advantage of this invaluable resource as you begin your collection. Once you are an expert, you can share your knowledge with those just beginning their online research.However, it is important that you protect your personal information and your collection when making transactions online. Internet security is better than ever but a good scammer can trick you right out of your money or your car. If anyone “accidentally” sends you too much money and then asks you to send the money to someone else, don`t participate. Overexcited car collectors all over the country have lost thousands of dollars to this scam.MAINTAINING YOUR COLLECTIONYour collection is valuable. Keep accurate records of each car in your collection. Not only will you know where to find any necessary information, the better your records, the better your coverage will be if anything should happen to any of the cars.Start your classic car collection on the right foot. Create a file for each vehicle in your collection. This file should include the following information:
• Title• Photographs of the vehicle from purchase to the end.• Manuals, if available.• Parts lists for reference.• Detailed records of all work performed on the car.• Receipts for all work performed.There are special policies for classic cars. In most cases, you can add each new vehicle in your collection to this policy. Many of these policies will cover the vehicles, even if you do not plan to drive the vehicle outside of your garage or a show lot. You can also attain property insurance policies that will cover the vehicles.Be careful when cleaning and maintaining your vehicles. Be sure to use cleaning products that will not compromise older fabrics, leather, and other interior surfaces. There are many excellent products available for cleaning antiques. These products are great for your classic car.Most older vehicles will need regular maintenance performed under the hood. If you are not a mechanic or you do not have any prior experience working on classic cars, ask a fellow collector to teach you the basics. Unlike the cars of today, classic and antique cars are far more simple to work on. There are also many excellent mechanics who specialize in classic and antique vehicles.SAFETYWith any moving vehicle, safety is important. If your car was in bad shape or wrecked prior to restoration, make sure the vehicle is roadworthy. Many states require that all vehicles pass a safety inspection. If a wheel falls off while you are driving or the steering wheel locks up, you could find yourself involved in a serious accident.Your classic car collection should be enjoyed. Compromising your safety and well being by failing to ensure that your vehicle is not a safety hazard is always a bad idea. Vehicle inspections are cheap. Basic safety features like seatbelts can save your life. You may even find a seatbelt system that can be hidden or removed for show purposes without compromising the car`s original design.",
Beat Box,"Beat Box Information  Intro ‘Beatbox’ is what you do when you produce vocal sound effects without using instruments. Many of us would have had the tendency to make or imitate sounds that resembled drumbeats or other musical instruments with our mouths when we were kids. Imagine finding out that what we were actually doing was ‘beatboxing’! This is an art whose basics must be learned properly and you need a lot of practice before you can perfect it. So lets take a look at some useful tips here that can help you get on with this fun hobby. The next thing you know, you will be performing on stage to huge crowds, just like human Beatbox legends Rahzel, Buffy, Doug E Fresh, Biz Markie, etc. who catapulted beatboxing to fame during the 1980s. 

As you train to beatbox - your vocal skills will develop. Beatboxing is also referred to as multi-vocalism and vocal percussion. So, the range of vocal skills in beatboxing will cover imitating sounds, singing and - everything vocal. Now human beatboxing is usually related to the urban and hip-hop genres of music, while vocal percussion relates to a-cappella and rockapella music groups. 
Basic Sounds In Beatboxing When you learn beatboxing, you’ll learn about the three basic sounds that form the foundation of beatboxing grooves and these get their names from the components of a drum kit. These are: • Kick drum • Snare drum • Hi-hat All three sounds are made in such a way as to give the listener the illusion that they are being made simultaneously, when the beatboxer is actually doing one at a time rapidly. Artists like Rahzel sing and beatbox at the same time – and this is really an auditory illusion, which is achieved by making continuous sounds. The ideal way to begin this illusion is to begin with the singing and then with the effects! 

In beatboxing, though you don’t need to hold a microphone, there are different techniques for doing so to enable you make different kinds of sounds – for example – the closed clasp for nasal bass sounds, open clasp for less nasal sounds, etc. Sometimes even two mics are used. Many artists develop their own special style with a mic and so will you as you practice and enjoy the groove. 
Breath Control Technique Have you wondered how beatboxers keep at it for hours together without actually seeming to pause for breath? Well, it comes through breath control. What they do is breathe and make their sound simultaneously. These are called inward sounds and you will learn that practically every outward sound can be made inward. One of the three basic sounds, the snare drum is performed with an inward sound. Snare sounds comprise of four different types made with the lips, vocal chords and tongue. A fifth breathing-in snare is a combination of two techniques. The five sounds help the beatboxers to produce that continuous sound that you hear. Just imagine – even though everyone uses similar methods, each person sounds so very different and unique! 

Once you learn the basic sounds, you put them into a beat. Your tutorials will teach you simple beat patterns that you can practice on and develop your own original stuff and work around songs. You can go ahead and pick any genre that is your favorite – whether it is hip-hop, rock, dance, grunge, etc. 
How To Go About Learning Beatboxing? As you pick up the basic techniques you will be able to practice these key sounds. Don’t worry about stumbling initially – just have fun as you imagine entertaining a big crowd. Try and listen to as many beatboxing artists as you can – there are plenty of audio clips and records available. This will inspire you – as you enjoy listening to them – and motivate you to try out all the sounds you hear. You will also be able to discern between different styles and techniques. Apart from all this it can be a great mood-booster to get you in the ‘groove’ and beatbox along with the great artists. 

Another way to get yourself into the right frame of mind is to try and watch live performances – a good performance can really draw you into the art. If you have friends who can go with you - all the better, since you might have company to learn. You can freely copy an artist – think `If Your Mother Only Knew` by Rahzel - and then do it in your own style. It will also help you build confidence to try new things and develop your beatboxing skills. 

Beatboxing takes initiative and innovation. It involves lots of creativity and allows you to experiment and explore. What we have given you here is information to get you started. You can learn your beatboxing skills and watch some great videos that will show you exactly how it is done at Discover A Hobby. Don’t forget to check out the wonderful books listed to help you know everything about beatboxing. Knowledge is power, so go ahead, beatboxer, and enjoy!",
Skydiving,"Skydiving Information  Introduction: Parachuting (or Skydiving) is an activity in which acrobatics are performed during a freefall, which is then followed by opening up of parachute. Parachute is a device or equipment which fills with air, retarding your fall. The act of parachuting is done as a competitive sport as well as a recreational activity. It is also used for deploying airborne military personnel force. You may even find deployment of forest firefighters being deployed through parachuting. 

Typically, in parachuting a parachutist is allowed to jump from aircraft at approximately 4,000 meters altitude and free falls for about a minute. During this time, he may perform acrobats before activating his parachute and land safely on the ground. 

Acrobats are performed if the skydiver or parachutist manipulates his body shape and produce forward, backwards motions or even do lifts. Once the parachutist opens his parachute he can then steer it in any direction and control the direction using the toggles attached to the parachute. With this he can land and aim for a landing site and land safely and easily on ground. For a skydiver taking fall for the first time, it is done with an experienced, trained instruction. 
History:
Early form: A cone-shaped parachute for the very first time came into sight in late 1470s, which was presented in a manuscript (Italian). The design was very much similar to Leonardo da Vinci`s design of parachute. It was designed to ensure the safety of people, i.e. in case of fire in a building (escape purpose), but was not practically tested. Leonardo da Vinci`s drew it (parachute) in the mid of 1480s at Milan. Its design was like a pyramid that was covered by a material as was kept open with the help of a wooden frame that was square. Faust Vrancic invented the first parachute in 1595. He gave his invention a name Homo Volans, which means a flying MAN. Then in 1617, he tested his design of parachute by putting it on and then jumped from a high tower located in Venice. This event was highlighted after 30 years in a book that was written by the secretary of society (john Wilkins) in London.  
Modern parachutes: Louis-Sebastian Lenormand invented modern form of parachutes in late 18 century (France). He was the first person who did the first public jump in year 1783. After two years Jean-Pierre Blanchard designed his parachute, implemented, and tested it on dog. After several years, in 1793, he conducted the test once again and this time he was the passenger himself, instead of the dog. With the passage of time, modified and refined structures replaced the previous one and now it is used in defense of the military. They take help of the paratrooper to attack the enemy from behind.  
Materials and Designs: A parachute is a mixture of thin, support taps, light mass fabric and lines (suspension line). Risers are used to which can be metal connector or cloth loop on the ends to gather the suspension lines. Further, the risers are connected to the strap that contains whole load. Inflation of very thin material increases the drag, which as a result slow down anything tightened to it. 

In past, silk was used for the manufacturing of parachutes but from past few years, silk was replaced by more reliable material (woven nylon fabric). Its quality can be further lifted by using coating of silicone. When ram –air or square parachutes were invented, the manufactures of parachute moved to low quality material like zero or Dacron stretch material. 
Equipment: Skydiving or parachuting is a game of death. This activity is so much dangerous that quality equipment should be the foremost priority. Buying equipment for parachuting is not that much easy. It cost very high, but one can get it on discounted rate. For that, you have to look for it. Followings are the equipments that are needed while doing skydiving: 

Parachute: Most important and basic equipment needed for skydiving is parachute. It is recommended to purchase it from parachuting shops as they ensure you its clearance before selling.   There are various types of parachutes, and the named based on the design. 

1- Round types: Used by military, in case of emergency or cargo deployment. They don’t provide lift and are drag devices purely. 

2- Square or cruciform type: Due to its design, the oscillations increase and violent turn when descending. 

3- Annular and pull down apex type: This is a variation of round types. 

4- Rogallo wing type: The parachute is quite often experimented with in sport parachuting. 

5- Ring and ribbon type: They have similar designs to annular design. The design is such as to allow deployemnet at supersonic speed. Typically, the parachute would burst open instantly at such high speeds. 

6- Para foil or ram –air type: Most of parachutes nowadays, are of this type. The parachute provides direction and speed control just as paragliders. 

Safeguards: Protecting parachuting equipment like padding, helmet and spinal protector can be very useful if something went wrong with the jump or improper landing. 

Jumpsuit: As you are falling down the pressure of winds hits on chest that sometimes causes problems. Jumping suits ensures your protection from wind as well from object which can hit you while landing. 

Altimeter: The altimeters inform us when to set out the parachute. 

Automatic Activation Tool or AAD: The job of AAD is to activate the parachute if you have not done it manually. This basic and very important piece of tool notices the following thing: 

1- With what speed are you falling? 

2- Why the parachute has not opened manually? 

3- When to release the backup parachute? 
Training There are numerous means to get parachuting training without truly jumping. One of such ways is Wind tunnels. It provides us with the chance to practice skills by falling freely through a virtual parachuting simulator which provides us with the ability to experience parachute control against high pressure of wind. 

If you want to start with the training, there are varieties of options or choice available to you, which includes AFF (Accelerated Freefall), static line, tandem and IAD (Instructor Assisted Deployment). 

Tandem: The most common and frequent choice of the beginner is tandem jump. It is done from immense height i.e. above 10,000 feet. In this style, the jumper is tight with the locks or rings of the instructor chest known to be a “tandem master”. It is a very good way to experience such thrill without having much knowledge. 

Static line: In this way of jumping, the jumper leaves the airplane on his own. As soon as he or she exits the line attached to the plane, the parachute automatically gets activated. This jump is conducted from great height usually 3500 feet above the ground. Moreover, the jumper or the student is connected to the instructor who is down on ground via radio guidance. By practicing for some time then the student is given some new equipments that enables him to activate his parachute on his own. In modern parachute “pilot chute” is available, having diameter around 3f. This pilot chute ensures the activation of main parachute as it is inflated. Students are allowed to activate their parachute, after they have done with many static jumps. Once they are used to it, altitude is increased to make sure they have something different to experience and gets familiar with real skydiving. 

IAD: IAD is an abbreviation of Instructed Assisted Deployment. It is the modification of static line way of jumping. The only dissimilarity is that in this the instructor himself manually releases the pilot chute. This pilot chute is responsible for pulling out the main canopy or parachute. Although, it may sound technically different but both automatically activates the parachute. Instructor manually deploys the pilot chute as soon as the student makes the jump. 

AFF: AFF is an abbreviation of Accelerated freefall. This way of jumping or this channel is for all those jumpers who are keen to become a pure skydiver. In this method student has to start with an altitude between 120000 feet to 14000 feet. Students jumps with his instructor. Instructor examines the student and corrects him during the jump. When he gets used to it, then he is trained with many other techniques like back flip etc. 
Tips 1. The first and the foremost tip is to make the mind for skydiving. Nothing can be achieved or you can’t be able to do it with perfection until or unless your mind is ready for you to do it. So ensure full concentration into it and make sure you are fully prepared. 

2. While looking for skydiving school, make sure you select that institution for your guidance which have proper certification in sky diving. 

3. Before you go for a jump, make sure you consult with a physician. He/ she will let you know whether you are fit to dive or not. 

4. Always do what your instructor says you to do. Any mishap during jump can lead you to death. 

5. Make sure you do your first jump after a training of 6 to 7 hours (ground training). 
FAQ At what altitude do skydiver normally jumps? 

Normally parachuting is done from a height of 12500 feet above the surface of the ground. In some case, it is performed even from a height of 14500feet. Altitude mainly depends upon type of plane, zone and jump. 

What is the maximum attitude of skydiving that has ever been achieved? 

The ever-highest exit was from a height of 102,800feet. It was made possible with a help of a special balloon which took the diver to such a high altitude. 

What is the appropriate height to activate parachute? 

The height varies. If you are an experienced diver then you can activate your parachute from an altitude of 2000feet AGL (minimum, according to United States Parachute Association). If you are an inexperienced then it is recommended to deploy your parachute from a height of 2,500 feet (minimum, according to United States Parachute Association). For certain training jumps it can be 5,500 feet as well. 

What is pilot chute? 

A pilot chute is a minute back up parachute that is used as a reserve parachute. This small reserve parachute is attached to the operation bag that contains the parachute via bridle. On latest parachuting rigs, you can find three sort of pilot chute: 

a- Throw-out b- Pull-out c- Spring loaded 

How difficult is it to pack a parachute? 

Packing a parachute is an easy task but if you are a beginner then you are not allowed to pack the parachute. In order to know how to pack it with perfection you have to make sure that you have taken some classes on packing techniques. 
Conclusion: Nothing can be more fun than suspending in the air and flying with your body. Parachuting or skydiving can be a lot of fun and enjoyable but one needs to be equipped with proper skills in order to feel the thrill of parachuting. You should learn proper skills or at least basic ones before you can perform this activity. For this you should take professional training. Once you do so and make that first jump, you will absolutely know why skydiving is so fascinating and feel the real adventure, something which you have never really experienced before in your life.",
Geocaching,"Geocaching Information  Introduction To Geocaching Geocaching is by far the most popular of the scavenger hunt type hobbies. From Boy Scouts to world travelers, geocaching provides countless hours of entertainment for people of all ages. Not only does geocaching encourage the thrill of the hunt, it is an opportunity to share your experiences with others. Trinkets and insights penned in logbooks provide others with the opportunity to share in your personal geocaching experience. 

Unlike geocaching`s predecessor, letterboxing, geocaching utilizes more technical methods for cache location. There are ten times as many caches worldwide than there are letterboxes. Each cache presents its own unique challenge and contents. 

Anyone can begin a geocaching hobby. With a few simple pieces of equipment and a little preparation, hundreds of thousands of letterboxes will open their lids to you. Once you get the hang of geocaching, share your new hobby with others. Take your friends, kids, and family on an adventure. Share your thoughts with other cachers in logbooks. Introduce those kids you volunteer with to this challenging and exciting hobby. 
History of Geocaching Hundreds of years ago, pirates traveled the world collecting treasure. These treasures were hidden in remote locations, their location buried beneath complex clues and confusing maps. While geocaching does not require the plundering of villages or burning of ports, geocachers can`t get enough of the excitement of the hunt. Letterboxing and geocaching may not claim to have roots in piracy but hide and seek on a global scale is clearly linked to piracy. 

The geocaching hobby is relatively new to the world. Even twenty years ago, the technology that now allows thousands of people to search even the most remote locations for geocaches did not exist. 
Types Of Geocaches As with geocaching`s predecessor, letterboxing, there are many different forms of geocaches. Purists will only search for certain caches while others are more concerned with logging as many finds as possible. Each cache has its own rules and behaviors. As new types become more widely recognized or popular, they are added to the list of accepted types of geocaches. 

Variations of geocaches include Traditional, Multi-cache, Offset, Night Cache, Mystery/puzzle, Letterbox Hybrid, Locationless/Reverse, Moving/Traveling, Virtual, Earthcache, Webcam, Event Cache, Cache-In Trash-Out (CITO) Events, Mega Event, GPS Adventures Maze Exhibit, and Wherigo cache. 
GPS Devices GPS Devices come in many forms. Fortunately, hand held GPS units are no longer bulky or unwieldy. Many cell phones are now equipped with GPS systems. Some brands are better than others. You can review GPS products online. There are many forums and sites that review GPS units as they relate to geocaching. 

New GPS units are released each year. While these new units are exciting, your best bet is to purchase a unit others have already tried. You might find yourself in the middle of a snowstorm with your brand new, very expensive, defective GPS. Let the company work out the kinks before you put your safety in the hands of a GPS. 

Some of the best GPS brands include: 

• Garmin • DeLorme • Magellan 

When selecting a GPS device, look for these key features: 

• Waterproof: Rain or shine, you need your GPS to find geocaches and return safely to your vehicle. • Radio equipped: If you are injured and there is another radio within range, you could receive lifesaving help quickly. • Long-lasting power (with standard batteries): Your GPS should last for 6-12 hours on standard batteries. • Base maps: Without base maps, you will be forced to purchase expensive map add-ons that can often double the cost of your GPS. • Computer compatible: You can manage your maps on your computer and only upload those relevant to the area you select. 

A note about cell phones 

There are some fantastic new phones on the market that claim to have GPS included. Not all of these phones have GPS when you are out of range of a cell phone tower. The Apple iPhone 3G is often used for geocaching and there are several geocaching apps available for downloading online. However, without a battery life extension, a traditional hand-held GOS unit will last much longer. Other features of a traditional GPS unit that are not found in a cell phone include waterproofing, durability, screen size, and simplicity. 

You do not need to spend a fortune to find a great GPS. Garmin alone offers several affordable and functional GPS devices. 
Other Geocaching Equipment Logbook 

Your logbook serves as a journal. You can record your finds, make notes, and write about your experience. You can also list which item you left and what you picked up for future reference. Many geocachers choose to travel without a logbook. While a logbook is not completely necessary, it does give you the opportunity to record your adventures on paper rather than keeping all of your geocaching data online. 

Pen/Pencil 

Never leave home without a writing utensil. You will need to log in to each cache and there are rarely extra pencils left in a geocache. 

“Treasures” 

Many caches hold their own treasures. These treasures vary from coins to toys to postcards and anywhere in between. You don`t need to carry around hundreds of trinkets. One or two will suffice. When you find a cache, leave your item and take another to move to another cache. 
Obtaining Geocache Data Before you head out into the wilderness to find a cache, do some research. Your first task is to locate data for the geocaches you plan to find. You can access thousands of these cache files online through geocaching websites. 

Determine which sort of adventure you would like to have. Do you plan to trek for days or do you prefer short, easy walks? Many geocaching sites allow you to narrow down geocaches by the type of terrain or the difficulty of the route. Once you narrow down the options, you can begin to download the GPX files. 
Converting and Filtering Data You probably can`t take your computer with you as you look for a geocache. You need to turn your geocache files into usable information. With the right technology, your computer program can communicate directly with your GPS device. Test the conversion before heading off for the first time. Make sure the file opens properly on your device or you might find yourself hiking with no map and no way to locate the geocache`s coordinates. 
Plant Your Own Geocache As you search for your first few geocaches, think about who put them there. What inspired them to choose the location? Where did you find the geocache file? The answers to these questions will guide you as you begin the process of planting your own caches. 

For some, the fun of geocaching lies in the planting of caches. The process is simple and anyone who can hunt for a cache is capable of planting a cache. 

Creating your cache is the easy part. The difficult part of planting your own cache is location. Not only does your cache location need to be secure and well-hidden, your cache must be placed legally. The ethics portion of this article details several examples of instances in which caches were mistaken for bombs or litter. Before you hide your box, always ask permission. 

The following locations are not good places to hide a geocache: 

• Airports • Banks • City, state, or federal government buildings • Schools • Hospitals • Prisons 

Places to seek permission before planting 

• State and national forests • Graveyards • Private property • Businesses 

Once you make your cache and get permission to stash your cache in the perfect spot, go ahead and hide the cache. The cache needs to be hidden well to prevent non-cachers from accidentally discovering your geocache. 
Geocaching Ethics While searching for a geocache in a graveyard, two ladies were approached by local law enforcement. The graveyard was maintained by local inmates. Drug dealers often hid drugs for the inmates in the woods surrounding the graveyard. The women were acting suspiciously. As the women explained what they were doing, the officer stated that in that case he probably wouldn`t arrest them. 

While these ladies were not arrested and the cache was not muggled, others were not so lucky. Geocaches found in airports can trigger a full evacuation. If this happens too often, geocaching could be outlawed in many places. Geocaching ethics apply to both those planting and those searching.   General guidelines for avoiding trouble include the following: 

• If an area is busy, wait to retrieve your geocache. • Carry small cards that explain your hobby. You won`t look like you are fabricating a story. • Don`t hide caches in areas with high security. • Check your state and local laws for regulations regarding geocaches or other scavenger hunt related activities. • Respect the cache area. Irritated landowners will not hesitate to throw away a cache. 

Basic Leave No Trace Ethics combined with common sense and some research will result in more successful plants and finds. When you geocache, you represent the hobby. If you exhibit poor behavior, your actions will directly affect public opinion of all geocachers. 
Geocaching Safety Any activity that requires the participant to head off into the woods to scramble around looking for a hidden is a safety hazard. Every year, hundreds of people in the United States alone get lost or injured in the wilderness. If you plan to geocache outdoors, do some research to ensure that you are fully prepared for anything that might come your way. 

Follow these safety guidelines to make your letterboxing experience the best it can be: 

1. If you plan to geocache alone, provide a list of the coordinates for every location you plan to visit. If you are lost or injured, rescue personell will find you more quickly if they have a general idea of your location. 

2. Before you leave your vehicle, set the location as a waypoint in your GPS. You will be able to locate your vehicle even if you get lost or have to return to your car in the dark. 

3. Pay attention to the weather and dress accordingly. Wear clothing that will keep you dry and warm in low temperatures or rain. Overdressing or underdressing can result in hypothermia or heat stroke. The proper footwear can prevent blisters, making your experience more pleasant. 

4. Eat food and stay hydrated. When you exert yourself, your body needs nutrients and water to recover. If you allow yourself to become dehydrated or hungry, you could become seriously ill. Hunger and dehydration also prevent the brain from thinking clearly resulting in more lost hikers each year. 

5. Bring the right equipment. If you rely on your GPS to get you from the cache to your car, bring plenty of extra batteries. A first aid kit that includes basic first aid supplies as well as Benadryl and Aspirin could save your life. Benadryl helps subdue allergic reactions and Aspirin can slow or stop a heart attack. 

There are books that hold hundreds of pages of safety advice for any outdoor adventure. The five tips above are the only safety guidelines you need to take into account. You can find endless sources online that can offer excellent advice for safely enjoying your new geocaching hobby.",
Slime,"HistorySlime started really making waves in August 2017 where the search term peaked. Bolstered by a wave of YouTubers, Instagram influencers, and other social media giants, slime quickly gained a foothold in the collective conscious of the American youth. It’s unclear exactly why the trend took hold. The recipe for slime isn’t particularly new, though the community that has grown around the substance absolutely is. While children are the main consumers in the slime movement, the captains at the helm of the slime ship are social media influencers. Karina Garcia, also known as the slime queen, is one of the largest influencers at the center of the slime craze. Currently sitting at just over 9 million subscribers, Garcia turned her hobby into a money-making opportunity. Garcia makes YouTube videos of her various slime recipes to educate and entertain viewers on different slime techniques. And she makes approximately $200,000 a month from sponsorships. Garcia isn’t the only one to take advantage of the slime market. Both Instagram and Etsy have carved out a slime niche for themselves. Instagram focuses on shorter DIY slime videos, while Etsy sells slime to those who don’t have the patience (or skill!) to make their own. Even Elmer’s Glue began to cater to the slime movement after seeing that their popularity as a slime ingredient had skyrocketed and even resulted in stores constantly running out of the product. Elmer’s began to promote a slime recipe that used contact solution as an activator instead of the less than kid-safe borax. It’s no surprise that celebrities like Jojo Siwa, famous for her bright and decorated clothing along with her dancing ability, would also align themselves with the slime movement. Slime is a tactile hands-on hobby great for those who want to get just a bit messy without long term commitment.",https://www.discoverahobby.com/slime#
Squash,"Squash Information  Introduction Squash is a high-energy racquet ball game that engages both the body and the mind. Played on an indoor squash court between two or four players, it consists of hitting a ball against a wall using racquets. There are two similar yet distinct forms of squash in existence: Softball, which is the ‘British’ or ‘international’ version and hardball, which is the American version. As the name implies, a softball game is played with a softer, slower ball on a wide, tall court. It is a physically demanding game requiring patience and deliberation in addition to physical fitness. In an average softball match, a ball stays in play far longer than in the American version and there is more court to cover. Hardball or American squash on the other hand is played on a narrower court with a harder, faster ball. The hardball game emphasizes quick reactions and creative shot making. 
Rules
Basic Play The objective of the game is to effectively hit the ball over the ‘tin’. At the start of a new match, the players traditionally spin their racquets to decide who gets to serve. The server stands with one foot inside the “service box” and attempts to hit the ball directly onto the front wall above the “cut” line. The server can have only one attempt to serve and looses the stroke if: 

• The server attempts to serve but fails to strike the ball. 

• The server looses contact with the floor within the service box. 

• To be successful, the server must have at least part of one foot within the service box, taking care not to touch the service box line. 

• The ball touches any wall other than the front wall first. 

• The ball hits the ceiling or the lighting. 

• The ball (unless volleyed) does not land in the back quarter of the court opposite to the one served from. 

• The ball does not land between the ‘cut line’ and the ‘out line’. If the ball lands on the line, then it is a fault. 

For a shot to be good, it must hit the front wall above the tin though it is okay for it to hit the other walls after it hits the front wall. Once the server makes the shot, the second player needs to volley the shot before it bounces twice against the floor. The shot can be taken either off the rebound or after the first bounce. 

If the return volley is unsuccessful, the server wins the rally and scores a point. If the non-server is successful in the volley, the players take turns hitting the ball against the front wall, above the tin and below the outline until one of them faults. 

When the non-server wins a rally, he gains the right to serve and the two players switch sides for the following point. The original server retains the right to serve as long as he wins points, serving from alternative sides for each point.  
Obstruction The presence of two players in a confined area wielding rackets can lead to problems of interference and basic rules of fair-play and etiquette demand that players do their level best to avoid potential obstruction of an opponent’s play. 

Any deliberate act of obstruction will cause the offending player to lose the point. This includes not allowing the opponent to hit the ball directly to the front wall. If they try to avoid interference but cannot, then the point is played again. Such an event is called a ‘let’ in squash. However if the accidental interference prevents the striker from hitting a winning shot, then the striker automatically wins the point.  
Competitive Squash As a rule, two officials monitor a competitive squash match: the referee and the marker. The referee is in charge and the marker assists him. The marker keeps the score and calls the play, deciding if the server serves a fault or if the striker does not make a good return of the ball. 

Should a player disagree with the marker’s call, he or she may appeal against the decision of the marker. The referee decides these appeals, awarding the stroke as called if he agrees with the marker and a let if he is not sure. If a good shot is called wrongly and he upholds the player’s appeal then a lot is played. In this last case, if the shot called wrongly, was an undisputed winner then the striker shall win the stroke. 

Again, the referee decides whether an obstruction has taken place. The referee also has the power to disqualify players and to award a game or a match against players who contravene certain rules. 
Different Styles: There are several variations of squash played across the world. In the U.S. hardball singles and doubles are played with a much harder ball and different size courts. Hardball singles has lost much of its popularity in North America (in favour of the International version), but the hardball doubles game is still active. The other version is softball or international squash. 
Equipment Squash requires very little equipment. You only need a racket, balls and suitable non-marking soled trainers along with comfortable sportswear.  
Rackets/Racquets Your racket is your main piece of equipment. It is recommended that you take your time when selecting a racket since the kind of racket you choose will significantly affect your game. According to the rules, a racket can have a maximum length, width and hitting area of 686 mm, 215 mm and 500 cm2 respectively. The strings must not be longer than 390 mm. The frame must be at least 7 mm wide, at most 26 mm deep, and have a minimum external radius of curvature of 50 mm, with a radius of curvature on the edge of at least 2 mm. The weight cannot exceed 255 grams. However, within these limitations you can have a number of permutations and combinations depending on your individual choice. 

The right racket can help increase both the power of your swing as well as the accuracy of your shot. The key factors involved in selecting a squash racket (racket) are the choice of design and materials, the weight, the balance and the stiffness or ‘whippiness’ of the model.  
Design The head – squash rackets have heads of various sizes and shapes depending on the model. In general, larger racket heads give you additional power and greater leeway in case of errors. Racket heads also vary according to the size of the grommet holes, which are the holes used to string the racket. A racket with larger grommet holes is the best choice for an amateur as larger holes give the racket more flexibility by allowing the strings to move more, with better odds of getting good hits. 

The Throat: There are two types of racket throats – ‘open’ and ‘closed’. The string area on open rackets is larger, which is better for amateurs. These rackets also have a larger sweet spot and therefore are more forgiving for the less skilled player. Closed throat squash rackets have a smaller string bed and sweet spot and is better suited for more experienced players. 

It is recommended that you consult a squash professional on the design and shape of the racket’s throat when choosing a model as certain designs make for decreased racket durability. The price of a racket varies according to the throat design and typically, the stronger rackets are also the more expensive ones. 

The Beam: Racket beam widths tend to be between 16 and 21 mm. It is recommended that first-time players choose a racket with a wide beam as a thin beam requires players to precisely direct their shots. This type of beam does offer greater control and maneuverability so you can consider switching to a racket with a thin bead once you have gained some experience. 

The Grip: Most players have a preferred grip shape and build up the grip on each new racket to feel the same. This helps them keep their shots consistent even after changing rackets. 

The grip is a part of the racket you should consider customizing. A simple method is to replace the original grip of the new racket with the specific brand or type of grip that you are used to. You can also build up the thickness and/or change the shape of the handle before wrapping on the new grip but this is a much more complicated process.  
Material You need to look for strength and durability in a racket. The material you choose ultimately depends on your style of play. Power hitters prefer rackets made of carbon, boron, and graphite since they make it easier to hit hard. Other players prefer materials such as Kevlar that are more flexible and absorb more impact. 

Titanium rackets blend the best of both worlds and offer great power and control but they tend to be more expensive. Furthermore, there have been reports of players having problems of breakage with some of the titanium composite models. 

If you are just starting out, you will probably want to opt for a racket with multi-filament or monofilament strings rather than professional-grade natural gut stringing which is much more expensive. Once you have decided on your material, it is recommended that you seek advice from a squash retailer as well as about other squash players on the durability record of the various racket models featuring your choice.  
Weight: The weight of a squash racket varies from around 120 grams to about 210 grams or more. Typically, rackets in the 140 to 170 gram range are used. A lighter racket allows a player to ‘feel’ the ball while striking and as such, it gives a beginner a feeling of control. However, because of the reduced weight, it generates less momentum and players need to add their own strength to put power into a shot. You need skill and technique to make the maximum of a light racket and as such, it is more useful for a more experienced player. What is more, the lighter a racket, the more it is going to cost you since the material needed to fabricate such a racket tends to be more expensive.  

Balance Different rackets have differing centers of balance. The best way to determine a racket’s center of balance is to try it out on court. Try out the rackets and reject ones that do not feel right. An unevenly balanced racket generally feels like it is “head heavy” or “head light”. However, there are players who deliberately go for non-balanced rackets in a quest for more power (head heavy) or more control (head light). The balance also varies within rackets of the same model. Therefore, you need to try out the specific racket you are planning to buy.  
Stiffness Different rackets have different degrees of give. Different people prefer different levels of stiffness depending on their personal styles of play. It is therefore recommended that you try out various rackets and test out how your shots perform with them. If you can control it, a stiffer racket is usually superior for both shot making and the power game. Just make sure to avoid very cheap rackets that tend to vibrate as they are hit. Once you ascertain the stiffness level that works for you, make a note of it and try to be consistent in the rackets you use.  
Buying a Racket When buying a squash racket, the main consideration should be whether it fits your style and expertise level and of course your wallet. Consider how much you are going to play. If a cheap racket does everything you want and feels good, there is no reason to spend more just to be loyal to a certain brand. Unless you are a dedicated player, it is better to opt for a cheaper racket made from aluminum. However, if you plan to play consistently, you can consider investing in a racket made from titanium or premium graphite. 

Select your racket based on what you wish to accomplish. If your goal is to maximize the power of your swing, choose a lighter racket. If you have a fast swing and need to control the ball better, pick out a heavier racket. 

Finally, always test a squash racket before purchase. Choose a store or pro shop that gives you the opportunity to ""demo"" a racket and then experiment with several different rackets on court. Try to get a feel for the swing and balance of each model and determine the differences in how they feel. The combinations of weight, balance, stiffness, etc. are endless and the choice ultimately depends on personal preference. 

While testing out rackets on court is preferred, you cannot obviously do so with the many popular online squash racket dealers. However, these online stores do have a definite advantage in terms of price and inventory. In such a case, find out if anyone you know has the model you wish to buy and borrow it for sampling.  
Clothing It is very important for every squash player to get hold of a good pair of squash shoes in order to make the most of the sport. Selecting the right pair of sports shoes is crucial since squash involves a lot of rotation of the ankles as well as exerting a significant degree of pressure on them. A wrong pair can very well cause a twisted ankle or worse. 

There are three major types of squash shoes: ankle-high lace shoes, standard lace shoes and slip-ons. Ankle-high squash shoes reduce the chances of a twisted ankle and as such, are the best option. While slip-ons are also an option, they fail to provide a good grip when compared to lace shoes. 

Choose a pair that offers adequate cushioning at the base. Some shoes also come with cushioning on the sides and on the top from the inner side but they tend to be more expensive. If you can afford them, then go ahead but they are not necessary. 

Always remember to try on the shoes before you buy them. it is recommended that you buy your squash shoes from a store instead of buying them online because this allows you to wear them and see if they are the right ones or not. 
How To Learn One of the great benefits of squash is that it is relatively easy to learn. Most local sports facilities will have at least one court and due to the current popularity of the sport, you can easily find someone who plays to explain the basics. While the rules may seem a little complicated, most people pick them up quickly and easily when they start playing. 
Tips and Tricks • Make sure to warm up before going out on court. Warming up helps stretch your muscles and will prevent potential muscle injuries from the sudden exertion at the beginning of the game. 

• It is important that you keep your racket up during the match. This reduces the distance to the beginning of your swing so you will be ready to hit the ball quicker. 

• Watch the ball at all times even if it means turning your head around to see the ball. 

• Always go back to the ‘T’ once you have played your shot. This places you in the centre of court where you will be in a position to cover wherever in the court your opponent returns the ball. Be sure not to hit the ball down the middle of the court 

• Make your opponent run. Place the ball as far away from him as possible. If your opponent is in the centre of the court, try to nudge them out to the back. The centre of the court should be your position. 

• Volley the ball wherever possible. This gives your opponent less time to prepare. 

• Aim the ball so that it lands deep in the court corners. Your opponent will not be able to return it easily from the back corner. If the ball lands short of a good length, aim higher on the front wall. 

• Vary the pace. Do not hit the ball hard all the time; lob it occasionally to test your opponents in the air. 

• Learn how to time your shot. Holding your shot when you have time to spare can help wrong foot your opponent. If however your opponent has struggled to return the ball, then taking the shot as early as possible will put more pressure on your opponent. 

• Finally, Practice! Practice! Practice! The more you play, the faster you will improve. 
Frequently Asked Questions Who Can Play Squash? 

Squash is a high-energy game involving constant motion. As such, it is not suitable for the very elderly, children under nine or those with joint problems. Pregnant women or women who have just delivered a child are also recommended not to take up this sport as it can adversely affect their health. 

What Are The Health Benefits To Playing Squash? 

There are a number of positive health and fitness benefits to playing squash. The fast-paced game is conducted with little pause which ensures that you end up burning a significant amount of calories with each match. A great aerobic workout, it will increase your muscular endurance and overall aerobic fitness. Playing squash will also help increase your cardiovascular fitness as the exercise causes more oxygen to be pumped around the body and helps energize muscles. After a few games, you will notice that your flexibility and sprint speed has increased along with your hand-eye co-ordination and concentration levels. 

Where Can I Find A Squash Court? 

• US Squash lists more than 1,000 squash courts across the United States 

• The YMCA has dozens of squash courts across the country and often provides guest passes for non-members 

What Is The Proper Care For My Racket? 

The most wear and tear on a squash racket occurs on the strings and the grip. It is a good idea to re-string your racket every three months because strings lose their elasticity with frequent use. Even if you are not a frequent player, it is a good idea to change strings a couple of times a year. With regular use, you will eventually notice a build-up of dirt and grime on your racket grip. At this point, it is recommended that you have your racket re-gripped by a professional. Additional precautions include: 

• Never leave a racket in your car   • Do not return your racket to your bag or its cover immediately after a game as this prevents any sweat on the grip from drying out. 

• Use your racket cover. It helps protect the racket and strings from wear and tear.",
Genealogy,"Genealogy Information  Introduction Genealogy is the study of families and tracing of lineages and history. Genealogists employ oral traditions, historical records, and genetic analysis learn about a family and to show kinship and pedigrees of the members. 
The Research Process The process of researching one’s genealogy is extremely complex. It requires the research of vast amounts of historical records and the occasional DNA analysis to prove kinship. One can make a fairly reliable conclusion of kinship based on several things, such as information gathered from living relatives and original records such as county records or family Bible recordings to establish kinship. The genealogist will become quite adept at gleaning information, whether direct or indirect from anything they come across related to their bloodline. All of these conclusions, along with evidence supporting those conclusions are gathered to form a family tree or genealogy. Everything must be supported in this- remember writing those research papers in high school and college? Same principal applies here- all statements given must be supported by some kind of reliable evidence. Just because great-aunt Kay says, “you are Martin Luther King Jr.’s fourth cousin” does not make it so without proof. 

The easiest way to begin is to start in the present and work backward. This way, there is a foundation for the research, names and dates to go from, as well as easily accessible documents. Parents, grandparents and aunts and uncles will all have birth certificates, marriage licenses and so forth for documentation. Family stories are another way to begin research. Great-aunt Kay says, “you are related to Martin Luther King, Jr.” - here is an opportunity to get proof. 

Genealogical software can be a great help to the genealogist- it will help keep track of pedigree charts that were created by hand. Another great aid to the hobby is the myriad of volunteer effort. Many websites and associations are available to help in the tracking of one’s family line. Such things as blogs, message boards and mailing lists specifically traced to certain family lines are available. They can be used, sometimes for free, sometimes for a small fee, annual or otherwise. They are infinitely valuable for obtaining advice for research, finding records and finding living relatives. 
Records Written records are a genealogist’s most frequently used tool. They are the most reliable and are readily available. While the first thing that leaps to mind may be birth and death records along with marriage certificates, there are many other forms of written record for the genealogist to use. Here is a list of the most widely used records- 

• Vital records, such as birth and death certificates, along with marriage and divorce records. • Adoption records • Church records (baptism, christening, bar or bat mitvah, membership, funeral) • Census • Telephone directories • Coroner reports • Court records • Family Bibles, personal letters, and diaries • Immigration records • Medical records • County records, such as property holdings • Military records • Newspapers (obituaries, social news, graduations) • Passport records • Passenger lists (such as were used at Ellis Island) • Social Security records • Tax records • Tombstone rubbings from the cemetery • Voter records • Probate court- wills and such In the 16th century, the governments of such countries as England and Germany began to keep records of their citizens that did not have means to keep record for themselves like the nobility and royalty had. They began with the churches, keeping track of things like birth, death and marriage with a certificate or some other sort of report. These can be found in national, regional, or local archive offices and the genealogist will use them to retrieve information about possible kinship or to verify the timeline of an ancestor’s life. 

For hundreds and up to thousands of years, genealogy books were used to keep records of names, occupations and other pertinent information in Asian countries such as India and China. 

Until the Gaelic civilization died out in the 17th century, Ireland’s genealogical records were kept by families of professionals. 
Types of genealogical information While family names are certainly one of the most identifiable pieces of information, they also cause the genealogical researcher quite a bit of confusion. In searching through records, one can find families such as Smith, Smyth and Smythe. They could all be the same family. Information for surnames may be found in marriage records, birth and death certificates and trade directories. 

Historical records pertaining to first names have the same problems as that with the surname, and place names. This is complicated by nicknames, which are very common, and Genealogical data regarding given names (first names) is subject to many of the same problems as are family names and place names. Additionally, the use of nicknames is very common. Kate, Kathy, Katie, Kat and Katherine are all interchangeable for a female, just like Bill, Billy, Will, Willy and William are for a male. 

Help is found in this mix with the middle name. While someone may be named Catherine but go by Cathy in some records, the middle name is seldom changed. They are occasionally inherited or some cultures such as Latinos, include both the mother’s and father’s surnames when naming their children. Occasionally in Western culture, a woman will take her maiden name as her middle name after she is married, so to preserve her father’s name if there are no male siblings. 

Brothers and sisters were often given the same first name in some areas of Germany- most frequently of a patron saint or some local authority, but they had a second name by which they were called. (Think George Foreman’s children.) If one of the children passed away, the next child of the same sex was given the same name. 

While the locations of ancestors` residences and life events are core elements of the genealogist`s quest, they can often be confusing. Place names may be subject to variant spellings by partially literate scribes. Locations may have identical or very similar names. For example, the village name Brockton occurs six times in the border area between the English counties of Shropshire and Staffordshire. Shifts in political borders must also be understood. Parish, county and national borders have frequently been modified. Old records may contain references to farms and villages that have ceased to exist. When working with older records from Poland, where borders and place names have changed frequently in past centuries, a source with maps and sample records such as A Translation Guide to 19th-Century Polish-Language Civil-Registration Documents can be invaluable. 

Available sources may include vital records (civil or church registration), censuses, and tax assessments. Oral tradition is also an important source, although it must be used with caution. When no source information is available for a location, circumstantial evidence may provide a probable answer based on a person`s or a family`s place of residence at the time of the event. 

Maps and gazetteers are important sources for understanding the places researched. They show the relationship of an area to neighboring communities and may be of help in understanding migration patterns. Family tree mapping using online mapping tools such as Google Earth (particularly when used with Historical Map overlays such as those from the David Rumsey Historical Map Collection) assist in the process of understanding the significance of geographical locations. 

It is wise to exercise extreme caution with dates. Dates are more difficult to recall years after an event, and are more easily mistranscribed than other types of genealogical data. Therefore, one should determine whether the date was recorded at the time of the event or at a later date. Dates of birth in vital records or civil registrations and in church records at baptism are generally accurate because they were usually recorded near the time of the event. Family Bibles are often a source for dates, but can be written from memory long after the event. When the same ink and handwriting is used for all entries, the dates were probably written at the same time and therefore will be less reliable since the earlier dates were probably recorded well after the event. The publication date of the Bible also provides a clue about when the dates were recorded since they could not have been recorded at any earlier date. 

People sometimes reduce their age on marriage, and those under ""full age"" may increase their age in order to marry or to join the armed forces. Census returns are notoriously unreliable for ages or for assuming an approximate death date. Ages over 15 in the 1841 census in the UK are rounded down to the next lower multiple of five years. 

Baptismal dates are frequently used to estimate birth dates, but care must be exercised- many religions do not perform infant baptisms- a person may not have been baptized until they were a child, or in some cases, an adult. Also, if there was something the family wanted to cover, such as a pre-marital pregnancy, the birth and or marriage dates would have been adjusted. 

Calendar changes must also be considered. In 1752, England and her American colonies changed from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar. In the same year, the date the new year began was changed. Prior to 1752 it was 25 March; this was changed to 1 January. Many other European countries had already made the calendar changes before England had, sometimes centuries earlier. By 1751 there was an 11 day discrepancy between the date in England and the date in other European countries. 
Reliability of sources No one’s memory is perfect, and the longer an event happened, the more difficult it is to accurately recall it. When one is searching out genealogical information, the date on the record in relation to the date the event happened is of importance. Where errors in recall are most frequently found is in the accuracy of dates, particularly if the event is recorded by someone for whom the event had no particular importance. Another common error is found in cultural differences. For instance, if the event happened in a place or time where women are not considered important, the information recorded will be skewed toward a male perspective. 
Software There is software specifically designed for use in family history searches and verification. This genealogy software will store such basic information as births, marriages and deaths. Other more complex programs will also hold other personal information such as location, occupation, church affiliation and other notes. 
Most programs can generate basic kinship charts and reports, allow for the import of digital photographs and the export of data in the GEDCOM format so that data can be shared with those using other genealogy software. More advanced features include the ability to restrict the information that is shared, usually by removing information about living people out of privacy concerns; the import of sound files; the generation of family history books, web pages and other publications; the ability to handle same sex marriages and children born out of wedlock; searching the Internet for data; and the provision of research guidance.   Programs may be geared toward a specific religion, with fields relevant to that religion, or to specific nationalities or ethnic groups, with source types relevant for those groups. Additionally, there are now genealogy software conferences- the first one ever was held in Salt Lake City, Utah. Here, one can investigate such technologies as handwriting recognition, GPS mapping, record digitization and digital preservation. 
Conclusion The study of genealogy has for years been a popular hobby for many people, and for many of them, it is more than a hobby. It is a connection to the past, a way of touching history through family connections. It can be as simple as just making out a basic family tree, or searching one’s roots out as far as one can. For some, genealogy becomes more than a hobby- they turn it into a satisfying career.",
Sports Trading Cards,"Sports Trading Cards InformationINTRODUCTIONWhen the goal is to have a new great hobby this summer, sports trading cards is just what the doctor ordered! Sports trading cards come in every sport imaginable, from the National Basketball Association, National Football League, Maj. League Baseball, and even the many professional soccer leagues of the world! The NASCAR circuit is not even left out when it comes to sports trading card enthusiasts as all of the drivers that are currently on the NASCAR circuit have at least one top card. Many of the sports card decks that used to come with gum have now been replaced with die-cut hologram specialized cards that are usually always the collector’s final goal of this set.Still a Low Cost Hobby to Enter IntoThe sports card hobby is great and can be started with as little as a dollar or two. The main goal is to collect the ones that are either the favorite team or player or the ones that might grow in value. Many cards that were bought or traded for are now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars! Many decks of sports trading cards are now in the range of 3.00 to 7.00 and more. Serious collectors normally buy their sports trading cards by the case lots as this way they can be assured of the most-sought after cards in a set. Think back to when you were a kid and had that great Michael Jordan rookie card! Just think how much that rookie card is worth in today’s market! Probably a lot of money! This is the beauty of sports trading cards as a hobby, there’s gold in them there cards!Any sports trading cards hobbyists need to understand that it takes money to buy packs of cards. Gone are the days when 25 cents got a pack. Many of the most-expensive sports cards are now seen as almost works of art. The most treasured and valuable sports trading card as of 2010 is Honus Wagner’s baseball card valued at 500,000.00!BASEBALL CARD COLLECTINGOne of the most common sports memorabilia items is the baseball card. Kids from all walks of life can often recall the days of their youth when they were collecting baseball cards and trading them with their friends. Ripping open that pack of ten cards with the gum in it was a treat that many kids took for granted.Sifting through the players one by one, usually flipping past most of them quickly, hoping for that one special card they still needed, elicited a level of excitement that few things in childhood could match.A baseball card is a type of trading card relating to baseball, usually printed on some type of paper stock or card stock. A card will usually feature one or more baseball players or other baseball-related sports figures. Cards are most often found in the United States but are also common in countries such as Canada, Cuba, and Japan, where baseball is a popular sport and there are professional leagues.While baseball cards were first produced in the United States, as the popularity of baseball spread to other countries, so too did the production of baseball cards. Sets appeared in Japan as early as 1898, in Cuba as early as 1909 and in Canada as early as 1912.ATTRIBUTESThe obverse (front) of the card typically displays an image of the player with identifying information, including, but not limited to, the player`s name and team affiliation. The reverse of most modern cards displays statistics and/or biographical information. Many early trade cards displayed advertisements for a particular brand or company on the back. Although the function of trade cards had much in common with business cards, the format of baseball trade cards also often resembled that of playing cards.While there are no firm standards that limit the size or shape of a baseball card, most cards of today are rectangular, measuring 2½ inches by 3½ inches (6.4 cm by 8.9 cm).BASEBALL CARD CLASSIFICATION: THE TYPE CARDSince early baseball cards were produced primarily as a marketing vehicle, collectors began to classify those cards by the `type` of company producing the set. The system implemented by Jefferson Burdick in The American Card Catalog has become the de facto standard in identifying and organizing trade cards produced in the Americas pre-1951. The catalog itself extends into many other areas of collecting beyond the sport of baseball. Sets like 1909–1911 White Borders, 1910 Philadelphia Caramels, and 1909 Box Tops are most commonly referred to by their ACC catalog numbers (T206, E95, and W555, respectively).RARE CARDSThe rare baseball cards are the ones which are difficult to find and also the most expensive ones. The rare type of cards are the oldest baseball cards and those from limited edition sets. A rare card generally must be kept in good condition in order to be valuable although the rarest cards can be worth tens of thousands of dollars even in poor condition. Price also increases if there is an autograph on it. Rare baseball cards or the vintage baseball cards do not have a certain price established. Their value is judged upon their quality, condition, rarity and upon the number of collectors that are seeking them.CARD COLLECTORVintage baseball cards have been a prime focus for countless collectors and historians of one of America`s favorite pastimes. Some baseball card collectors may even pay large sums of money to get in the possession of these cards and they may also put a lot of time in it. Since rare baseball cards are difficult to find, collectors seek for ways to be aware of the rare cards that come into the trading or selling market. Baseball card collectors normally obtain them from other card collector or from specialized dealers. Some collectors may sell rare baseball cards over the internet and very often on eBay.Rare baseball cards may also be purchased at major baseball card shows. These events are held each year in different cities, allowing baseball card collectors and dealer to meet. The rare baseball cards do not have a specific price and they are worth what other collectors are willing to pay for, and in order to establish a price, the collector takes into consideration the condition of the card. The price of the rare cards depends as well on market demands. If there are many collectors whom are looking to get an specific rare card, the one who gets it is the one who pays more for it regardless of its predetermined value.IN THE GAME TRADING CARDSIn The Game is a sports card manufacturing company with offices in Canada and the United States. In The Game, often abbreviated to ITG, was founded by Dr. Brian Price in 1998. Currently, In the Game only produces hockey trading cards.In The Game`s first entrance into the trading card market came in the 1998-1999 season, when they produced the NHL Players Association`s ""Be a Player"" brand trading card set, which featured one certified autograph card per pack. Since then, In the Game has expanded its production to include other sets.In 1998, Dr. Price was asked by Ted Saskin of the NHLPA to determine what should be done with the NHLPA`s Be a Player hockey product. The product was started in 1994 and was supposed to give to each of the NHLPA licensees for two years. Pinnacle had the license for 1996 and 1997 but they went bankrupt and are a Player needed a home. Price was hired by the NHLPA as a consultant to determine the fate of is a Player. After he completed his research, he advised Saskin that Upper Deck should be given back a Player brand because of collector loyalty. Saskin felt that if Upper Deck had the brand that they would control too much of the marketplace.That is ironic since it was Saskin that give Upper Deck a monopoly in the hockey trading card market several years later. However, at that time he asked Price if he would come back into the hockey card market and manufacture is a Player in partnership with the NHLPA, he agreed and In the Game was born.In 2005, in conjunction with the 2004-05 NHL lockouts, the NHL Players Association (NHLPA) terminated its license agreement with In the Game. The company has continued to produce trading card sets featuring retired NHL players, and minor/junior hockey players. After the 2005-06 seasons, In the Game obtained a license to produce cards featuring players and logos under the umbrella of Hockey Canada. During the 2006-07 seasons, ITG produced the critically acclaimed International Ice Signature Series along with boxed sets commemorating gold medal wins by the National Women`s team and World Junior Men`s team.",
MMA - Mixed Martial Arts,"MMA - Mixed Martial Arts Information  Introduction Ever since specific fighting style emerged, humanity has often asked the question, “Which fighting style is better?” Records dating back to the time of Rome indicate martial skills were pitted against one another to answer this very question 

These contests would feature both armed and unarmed combat techniques. On occasion mounted styles were even thrown into the mix. However, when you consider the fact that many of these contests ended in death, it could not be a sustainable form of entertainment. 

The early 1900’s saw a resurgence of this interest. Boxers were often pitted against wrestlers to see which skill prevailed. By the end of the 1900’s the question of “Which is best?” expanded to every form of unarmed martial art. 

The concept of mixed martial arts is simple. How can you adapt to your opponent’s fighting style? This means switching techniques given the situation. Here is where the heart of mixed martial arts lay. 
The Rules As the most popular mixed martial arts shows grew in popularity, it was found that rules were needed. These rules both served to protect the fighters as well as make the structure of shows easier to manage. On a whole there are still fewer rules than many competitions due to the wide variety of styles employed. 

However, if the fighters are still amateurs in the sport, it is common for more rules to be added. For example, elbow strikes are often banned for those beginning in the sport due to the severe damage that can be caused. 

The best way to understand the reasoning for a rule is to understand how it improves the sport. These rules can be broken down into three major categories, the show, the fighter, and victory conditions. 

The clearest area to understand is victory conditions. This is how you determine a winner which is helpful in any contest. The other two areas provide a benefit to either the show that is being put on or for the benefit of the fighter’s health.  
The Show Promoters of the mixed martial arts competitions quickly learned that size played a major factor in the entertainment value of the matches. Therefore, on of the first rules instituted was a weight class system. The following is a list of these weight classes 

Flyweight = 125 lbs. and under. 

Bantamweight = 126 lbs. to 135 lbs. 

Featherweight = 136 lbs. to 145 lbs. 

Lightweight = 146 lbs. to 155 lbs. 

Welterweight = 156 lbs. to 170 lbs. 

Middleweight = 171 lbs. to 185 lbs. 

Light heavyweight = 186 lbs. to 205 lbs. 

Heavyweight = 206 lbs. to 265 lbs. 

Super Heavyweight = 266 lbs. and up. 

Another problem involved the timing of the fight. Before rules were instituted there was no way for promoters to plan how long a fight would take. Therefore, rough guidelines were set to dictate the pace. 

The standard time rule for a match is three rounds with each round lasting five minutes. Championship matches are usually five rounds last five minutes each. To further encourage the speed of matches, referees can utilize the “stand up rule.” 

In this rule, if the referee sees that the competitors are resting or not advancing the fight, they can instruct the fighters to stand and resume the fight. 

Further modifications can be made based on the organization and the country the event is located in. However, to keep the spirit of mixed martial arts, there are usually only minimal changes to the rules.  
The Fighter Certain moves from the outset were viewed not to be part of a martial art. Therefore, these moves were judged to be illegal for most mixed martial arts competitions. These include eye gouging, groin striking, finger bending, or hair pulling. Additionally some competitions further restrict certain types of strikes. 

Examples of these limitations may include no head butting, no kneeing an opponent when they are down, and/or no elbow strikes. These rules will vary based on who is competing and where. Amateur fighters are more likely to be restricted on their elbow strikes where as professionals are not. Certain events in Japan will allow knee strikes to the head of a grounded opponent. These are just a few exceptions and applications of these optional rules. 

As for clothing, many organizations require shorts for men and shorts with a sports bra like top for women. This promotes flexibility and prevents the disadvantage present in certain uniforms worn by specific martial art styles.  
Victory Conditions It goes without saying, you can’t fight to the death. Therefore, ways to determine the victor were needed. Victory in this case is determined by one of six outcomes. 

These outcomes are, knock out, submission, scoring, forfeit, disqualification, or no contest. Some of these results only occur in very specialized circumstances. For instance, forfeit happens when one competitor pulls out of the fight before it has even begun. Another specific example is that of no contest. 

A no contest ruling is made by the referee. They must rule that both fighters were disqualified. This could be done by ignoring the referee or breaking other rules that were set down before the match. 

The most straight forward victory condition is the knock out. This happens when one of the fighters reaches the state of unconsciousness. This can be achieved in a couple of ways. A blow can incapacitate them or a fighter can pass out from a certain amount of pain. However the state is reached it means an automatic victory for the other person. 

Submissions are another common way for a match to end. There are three ways for one side to submit. Two of these ways involve the fighter. The third involves that fighter’s towel man. The fighter can either tap the mat or body part to indicate submission. The towel man can throw the towel in the ring to signify they give up. Part of the towel man’s job is to determine whether or not their fighter’s only outcome is to lose. Many times a fighter will not be the best judge of when to quit. 

Finally, the most complicated victory condition involves scoring by the judges. These judges will look at strikes, grapples, damage taken, and anything else they feel is pertinent to the match. The judging only comes into play when either the time expires or the other victory conditions weren’t met or when the match has been stopped. 

A match can be stopped under a number of conditions. Some of the more basic stoppages are ruled by either the referee or doctor that is on hand. For instance, if a person passes out from a submission maneuver the referee will call for a stop to check that person’s condition. The doctor can also call for a stop if they notice an exceptionally large cut or broken bone. 

During these stoppages, it can be determined that the cause of the injury was evidence of a disqualifying move. This disqualification will also grant the victory to the other fighter. 
How to get started Unlike other forms of martial arts, there is no clear way to learn mixed martial arts. This is not to say, it is impossible to learn. Rather, you can have difficulty finding a single trainer to teach you what you want to know. 

The concept of mixed martial arts lends itself to a very personalized approach. It involves you to make choices on how you want to fight. This means, the only structure you can find is you. 

For beginners, it may be easier to start in a specific martial art you like, and then study other arts and strategies used to find other styles that compliment you. 

To decide on a good strategy, the best course of action is to study the champions of the mixed martial arts competitions. Chances are the next year’s winners will be looking to emulate and improve on the winning strategies of the previous year. 

This hobby is ideal for an advanced martial artist. The goal is not to find new meaning in yourself, but to add more functionality to your style. 

When it comes to equipment, you may need to find multiple training facilities that can instruct on the different forms you select. Each of these martial arts may require their own specific training gear. This can get costly depending on the art and the quality of equipment you choose. 

When you finally reach the level of mixed martial arts, you’re major concerns for equipment will involve whatever your style requires for maintaining your body, i.e. weights, mats, punching bags, gloves, gi, etc. Needless to say, only the successful can reach the professional level.  
Areas of study The following are popular areas in which to focus yourself. This gives examples on good martial arts that improve certain areas of fighting. This is not a comprehensive list and should only be used as a rough guide.  
Popular disciplines Most `traditional` martial arts have a specific focus and these arts may be trained to improve in that area. Popular disciplines of each type include: 

Stand-up: Various forms of boxing, kickboxing/Muay Thai, and forms of Kung Fu, Taekwondo & full contact karate are trained to improve footwork, elbowing, kicking, kneeing and punching. Clinch: Freestyle, Greco-Roman wrestling, Sambo and Judo are trained to improve clinching, takedowns and throws, while Muay Thai is trained to improve the striking aspect of the clinch. 

Ground: Submission Grappling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Luta Livre, shoot wrestling, catch wrestling, Judo and Sambo are trained to improve ground control and position, as well as to achieve submission holds, and defend against them. 

Some styles have been adapted from their traditional form, such as boxing stances which lack effective counters to leg kicks and the muay thai stance which is poor for defending against takedowns due to the static nature, or Judo techniques which must be adapted for No Gi competition. It is common for a fighter to train with multiple coaches of different styles or an organized fight team to improve various aspects of their game at once. Cardiovascular conditioning, speed drills, strength training and flexibility are also important aspects of a fighter`s training. Some schools advertise their styles as simply ""mixed martial arts"", which has become a genre in itself; but the training will still often be split in to different sections.  
For less intense mixed martial artists It should be noted that this page has been dedicated to the more competitive side of mixed martial arts. Some places don’t require this level of dedication. 

While mixed martial arts was initially practiced almost exclusively by competitive fighters, this is no longer the case. As the sport has become more mainstream and more widely taught, it has become accessible to wider range of practitioners of all ages. Proponents of this sort of training argue that it is safe for anyone, of any age, with varying levels of competitiveness. 
Conclusion Even today mixed martial arts are viewed as a barbaric form of fighting. The lack of rules and nature of the sport give good reason for this. However, this approach to the idea of fighting has revolutionized fighting. 

The idea of versatility coupled with individuality gives mixed martial arts a real interest in today’s generation. Every year the sport and its fan base get larger. It may never be an Olympic sport, but it doesn’t try to be. 

With the freeform style there is much to say about each fighter’s personal style. Given the wide variety of fighting options a person can draw from, it is always interesting to see how someone might combine and package their own strategy. 

Only the most serious and well-trained individuals should pursue mixed martial arts. Being a full contact sport it remains extremely dangerous. The only benefit is that it promotes greater versatility in your fighting style. This is definitely not a sport for the faint of heart.",
Pole Dancing,"Pole Dancing Information  Introduction The hobby of pole dancing is one that is shrouded in misinformation based on the sexuality that was once, and in certain places still is, associated with it. It is actually impossible to not start by discussing the origins of pole dancing in burlesque houses and gentlemen’s clubs in the early 1920’s, but the hobby has grown significantly from those early days. Sure, pole dancing is still a huge part of adult entertainment, but a new movement has begun to surface that shows the positive health benefits to the art of pole dancing. Despite its early beginnings, the hobby can be viewed as a combination of gymnastics and dance performed on a vertical pole. Not so much of a stretch should you think of the vertical poles used in the Chinese circus, which features a non-erotic environment, or the hugely popular sport of Mallakamb in India, which is essentially an Olympic style sport performed on a vertical pole. Before you are able to take serious the hobby of pole dancing, you must first shed the erotic nature of the phrase “pole dancing”, which has deterred many from practicing the hobby. 
History of Pole Dancing Just as it was mentioned in the introductions, Pole dancing is suspected to have been started in the United States of America during the 1920s depression. At this time, the general technique that the dancers in traveling shows used in this time period is by using a tent pole as a prop. There is a close relationship to Chinese poles, but at times the relationship is unclear because Chinese troupes, who performed in Barnum and Bailey`s Circus from 1914, did not perform on poles and performed in a non-erotic environment. 

As a relatively new movement throughout North America, Pole dancing is now regarded as a recognized form of exercise and can be used as both an aerobic and anaerobic workout. It is a form of exercise that is beginning to be offered in various health clubs and exercise gyms for both men and women. Recognized schools and qualifications are being developed as pole dancing increases in popularity, with the overall sex appeal toned down. 
Pole Dance as Exercise Pole dancing has gained popularity as a form of exercise, with increased awareness of the benefits to general strength and fitness. This form of exercise increases core and general body strength by using the body itself as resistance, while toning the body as a whole. Pole dancing as an exercise is very similar to Mallakhamb, an Indian men`s sport with no erotic component, but there is no evidence of a link. 
Benefits to Pole Dancing When one removes the erotic nature from pole dancing and opens their minds to the numerous benefits to pole dancing, one quickly realizes that there are many reasons to start pole dancing today. The first thing people do when trying to lose weight is to burn off as many calories as possible, and because of the fast pace dance aspects of pole dancing, burning calories is one of the easiest goals to reach and maintain. The closest relationship pole dancing has with other work outs is aerobics, but in addition to the aerobic and anaerobic workout, the pole is added to achieve better muscle toning. 

Due to the up and down movements on the vertical pole, the body’s muscles receive a tremendous workout that tones your abs, arms, shoulders, and legs. By focusing on specific routines, the instructor of the class is able to focus on specific muscle groups to give you a full body work out. Like most dance related activities, flexibility is one of the earliest achievements that are acquired while having the time of your life. Once the basics are learned, more advanced movies can be learned, which in turn builds confidence and self esteem not to mention you will be the envy of all your friends. 
Purchasing a Pole With the growing popularity of pole dancing as a form of exercise, many women and men want are seeking the convenience and privacy of a home dance pole. Whether you are a beginner pole dancer, or perhaps one of many fitness instructors thinking of getting into the business of teaching pole dancing classes or doing home pole dancing parties, there is a sudden need solid of relevant information on specific features of the different pole dancing kits including safety and durability. 

Due mainly to the sudden boom in interest for the new hobby of pole dancing, dance poles now come in a variety of materials that feature an array of different features for both home and studio use. No matter what your situation is in life, there is more than likely going to be a pole that is best suited to your specific needs. 

Of the many popular poles that are now available for private purchase, the more popular are permanent poles, removable poles, friction fit poles, portable poles, platform poles, and rotating poles. Essentially, the main two options that one has to consider prior to the purchase of a pole is whether or not the pole is going to be permanently fixed into place, or if you will want to change its position or location at some point in the present or future. Just like any other product on the market, there are different brands of poles with slightly different features within each basic type of pole that ranges in price from inexpensive to expensive. 

The one pole that is highly recommended by most in the hobby is the permanent pole because it is exactly what it is name, permanent. Unlike the other poles that can be easily moved should the need be required, the permanent pole is firmly set in place, usually being attached at both the top and bottom of the pole, so that it can never move. This feature make this the safest pole available on the market because there are no safety concerns about it coming free from its position midswing due to its permanent position. This feature is also its only con because of its inconvenience should their come time to actually move it. This is the most common pole found in clubs and exercise facilities. Next to permanent poles, removable poles featuring movable fixtures are the next safest type of pole that allows for easy movement should it be required. Because of its extra parts, there is an added risk of failure in the mounting hardware, but compared to the friction fit pole, which mounts like the name suggests by friction between the floor and ceiling, it is considerably safer. 
How to Learn Pole Dancing The easiest method to learning this hobby is to join an aerobics class at your local gym. Most cities in North America now have gyms that offer pole dancing classes as an alternative form of exercise to the more traditional forms of aerobic and anaerobic exercises. You may still have to do a bit of searching when it comes time to find an instructor, but the search is usually less painless than one would think. The benefits to learning from an instructor is that you have a one on one relationship that guarantees a better work out through specific levels of motivation. This method also offers the ability to meet other individuals who love the same type of exercise, which could lead to a more fun filled experience. 

The other option that is continuously growing in popularity is instructional videos and books that allow individuals the ability to learn in the private of their own homes. Let’s face it, there are a lot of people who just simply are not comfortable with the thought of swinging around a metal pole where strangers can watch them, especially where the thoughts of erotic dancing is still present. But the immediate downside to training at home is that you are forced to purchase your own dancing pole, where prices could start around the $250 range. If that isn’t a problem, then you essentially have an all in one home gym that takes up nearly no room at all. Videos and books may not match the level of teaching and motivation an instructor could give you, but the videos and books will give you a solid walkthrough of the various moves and routines. 
General Safety Tips In addition to the various safety issues related to the various types of poles available on the market, the following is a list of tips that will help you stay safe while you are learning your new hobby. One important thing to mention is that there is no safety equipment associated with the hobby, so before your are spinning upside down on a dancing pole, it is a good idea to master the beginner moves associated with the exercise. 

Wash your hands before you dance in order to remove lotions, creams or any natural oils on your handsthat may make the pole unnecessarily slippery when dancing. Always ensure your hands are clean and dry before attempting an type of exercise of a dancing pole. If you`re sharing your pole in a class setting, frequent hand washing will also help prevent the spread of colds and flu as these poles, like door handles, can harbor numerous microscopic germs. 

Remove rings, watches and any other loose jewelry, to protect your pole from being scratched during the swings and slides associated with the exercise. Like most athletic activities, it is recommended to remove all jewelry to prevent unwanted injury. Loose jewelry like necklaces can become a hazard when learning spins and inversions because they also spin and flip about the neck. At best, these can distract you as they move, and at worst they could become caught between you and the pole, causing you to lose your grip and fall. 

Avoid covering your palm with gloves or other fabrics when pole dancing. While gloves marketed specifically for pole dancing may provide the grip you need for climbing safely, they can also act like an oil or lotion and cause you to slip and fall. Pole dancing injuries are inevitable if you don`t have a good grip on the pole. 

Always use a spotter or helper when learning the basics and new moves. This is especially important when doing advanced moves such as inversions where the risk of falling is considerably greater. There are serious consequences associated with falls from these moves, so protect yourself and practice good dance pole safety by having someone spot you. 

Safety mats are a good option when beginning to learn pole dancing, but they are almost a necessity when learning inversions and other advanced moves. While there is no replacement of a good spotter, mats can give you increased confidence, and in case they`re ever needed, will help soften the landing to prevent injury. 

Do regular safety checks on your pole, including the fittings and small parts such as cotter pins, screws, and other mounting hardware. Take a few moments prior to each dance to do a quick dance pole safety check, and you could help avoid a painful accident to yourself, friends or family, and damage to your property. 
Conclusion While for the most part the hobby of pole dancing is still associated with night clubs and adult entertainment, there is a strong movement in modern times to help move the hobby from the club to your home or gym. At first this transitions seemed to be impossible, but by looking through history, we can see different circumstances, mainly mallakamb and the Chinese Pole, that showed the non-erotic nature of pole dancing. By eliminating the erotic nature of the pole dance, instructors have developed a fantastic all in one gym that acts as an aerobic and anaerobic exercise while at the same time developing specific muscle groups for better tone and definition. As the hobby expandes, there is no longer a necessity to join a gym to complete the workouts taught on dance poles, as now poles are readily available for home use and there are comprehensive books and videos available to progress the beginner pole dancer through to the advanced levels of pole dancing.",
RC Boats,"RC Boats Information  Introduction A boat glides effortlessly around a glassy pond. Another screams across a lake at rocket speed sending a plume of white spray into the sky. This is RC boating and these boats are, without a doubt, some of the most exciting radio-controlled machines around. 

Are you looking for a graceful boat that shows off your carpentry skills? Would you prefer a high speed boat that crushes the competition? RC boats are whatever you want them to be. Regardless of your preference, this popular hobby allows you to develop your style and show off your skills. Your imagination is your only limitation. 

A radio-controlled boat is a boat controlled remotely with radio control equipment. As the operator does not need any special licensing to operate the boat, this is an excellent hobby for the inexperienced. While it may take some time to get the hang of steering, RC boats are fun to learn and more fun once you understand the basics. 

From building RC boats to sending them off across the water, RC boats provide hours of indoor and outdoor entertainment. Whether you take pleasure in the personal aspect of boat building or you prefer the adrenaline rush of a high speed chase, RC boating has something to offer you. 
History RC boats evolved from the classic boat model. Many of the same construction techniques and concepts remain the same. The primary difference between a model boat and an RC boat is movement. A model boat is not necessarily seaworthy and does not have a motor. An RC boat must be seaworthy and will include a motor of some sort. Though the two are in different categories, their history is shared. 

While model boat history reaches back for thousands of years, radio-controlled boat history is short. In 1898, the first radio-controlled machine of any sort was used. This machine was a model boat. However, it was not until the mid 1940s that the public had real access to radio-controlled boats. 

The history of RC boats is divided into two sections. The first, model boat history, includes the origins of our fascination with model boats. The second, radio-control history, shows the evolution of radio-control technology and its many applications throughout history.  
History of Model Boats From Ancient Egyptians to 20th century boat fanatics, model boats played an important role in society. Whether the model boat served a ceremonial purpose or preserved war memories, each and every model boat throughout history plays a role in our understanding of history and culture around the world.  
History of Radio-Control While the original radio-control boat was simple and lacked the technologies of today, the concept changed war, toys, and history forever. Radio-control remains a core component of many military maneuvers. Few toy vehicles are manufactured without radio-control. 
Getting Started Now that you know the basics, it is time to begin your RC boat adventures. From the perfect spot to the right boat, there are several factors to consider before you send an RC boat off across the water.  
Location, Location, Location The body of water you choose to use will determine which type of boat is best for you. Every RC boat feature works well with a different body of water. For example, the size of the body of water greatly affects the RC boat`s ability to function. 

- Large body of water (river, lake, ocean): Large and powerful boats can navigate waves and choppy conditions well. Small boats are difficult to control in large bodies of water. 

-Small body of water (pool, pond, small lake): Small, less powerful boats navigate well on smooth water. Powerful boats cannot generate enough speed if the body of water is too small. 

Other factors include population density, water type, flora and fauna, as well as regional weather. For instance, an RC sailboat will not perform well in an area with no wind and an RC submarine might not survive a trip through a lilypad-infested pond.  
Choose Your Vessel There are a myriad of choices to make when choosing your first RC boat. Beginner boats are not too expensive so you are not necessarily stuck with your first boat choice forever. However, making good choices will lead you to the boat that is right for you. 

Your first choice is the most simple. Do you want to build your boat or would you rather buy one that is already built? If you would like to build your boat, look for BYOB kits (“Build Your Own Boat”). For those who would rather skip the construction process, look for RTR (“Ready To Run”) boats.  
Controls The radio control unit is a key feature of your RC boat. The onboard receiver should be waterproof and powerful. The handheld controller, or transmitter, can be selected based on your personal preference. The controller is either a stick control or a pistol control. Both allow you to control the steering and speed of your RC boat.  
Fuel There are several fuel options for your RC boat. RTR kits are more limited but all three types are available. 

- Electricity – Variable in power. Great for beginners and smaller boats. Many of these boats are extremely powerful. 

- Nitro – provides extra power and speed. These motors are more high maintenance. This fuel is the most expensive of the three types. 

- Gas – Another high maintenance motor. However, these 2-cycle engines are well suited to larger, more powerful boats. Gas is also less expensive than nitro.  
Hull The correct hull choice will improve speed, increase stability, and enhance maneuverability. Your selection will directly influence your ability to control your vessel. However, many choose to sacrifice one feature for an enhancement in another area. For example, you might choose to increase speed and lose maneuverability. 

There are three hull categories. 

- Flat-Bottom – While many flat-bottom boats are not radio-controlled, those that are can be quite fun. A hovercraft or airboat will maintain a pocket of air between the boat and the water as it propels itself forward. 

- Monohull – The monohull is very common in RC boats. The hulls in this category are vee shaped to maintain contact with the water at all times. The hull vees vary to increase speed (deep-vee) or stability (shallow-vee). 

- Hydroplane – Multiple surfaces of the hull are in contact with the water in hydroplane hulls. This increases speed by reducing drag on the boat. Outriggers are among the fastest of all RC boats.  
Materials The most common materials used for ship models are: 

- Wood—commonly solid wood, two pieces of wood with a vertical seam or slabs of wood placed one on top of each other. 

- Plastic—including both injected styrene and cast resin models. In larger scales (1/192 and larger), fiberglass is often used for hull shells. 

- Metal—usually cast lead or other alloys. Steel, sheet tin and aluminum brass are used less frequently for hull construction, but are used extensively for adding details. 

- Paper—preprinted paper construction kits are common in Europe, and are available in a variety of scales. 

Your local model shop or RC boat club might have some suggestions for a great body of water to use or an excellent beginner RTR RC boat brand. At the very minimum, look for a boat that is cheap, easy to maintain, and simple to control. For example, the perfect beginner boat might read as follows: 

- RTR - Stick control -Electric -Deep-vee monohull - Plastic 

When it comes to selecting your boat, choose what works best for you. Most importantly, enjoy your new RC boat hobby. 
Rules, Regulations, and Safety Whether your RC boat is the size of your palm or large enough to hold a person, it is important that you comply with your area`s boating rules and regulations. Water safety is also important. Pat attention and make good decisions to prevent injury to yourself and others as well as damage to your boat or other property.  
RC Boat Regulations If you plan to operate your RC boat in a body of water you or a friend own, you are subject to fewer regulations. Public land and large bodies of water are a different case altogether. 

In general, RC boats are required to follow many of the regulations set in place for their full size counterparts. These regulations vary by area but include things like sound, fuel type, speed, and size. Of course, your RC boat will more than likely be smaller than any other motorized vessel. However, if the area prohibits all boat activity, your vessel is probably also prohibited. 

If you are in doubt or you have questions about the regulations surrounding your body of water, ask the local officials for more information or regulation clarification.  
RC Boat Racing Rules If you are building your own RC boats for pleasure, the rules are lax if they exist at all. However, once you move into the competition, racing, and show world, you and your boat will be required to comply with national and international standards. 

There are two organizations in North America that create and monitor the rules of RC boat competitions. The oldest of these associations is the International Model Power Boat Association (IMPBA). This association was established in 1949 during the initial RC boat craze. They set the original racing classes, rules, and regulations. Even today, most races and regattas are held under the IMPBA rules and regulations. 

Another association, the North American Model Boat Association International (NAMBA International), also sets rules and regulations for RC boat competitions. This association was founded during 1969-1970. 

Both associations have dedicated and passionate members. If you choose to race, pick your club based on the rules you like or the association most prominent in your area.  
RC Boat Building Rules & Regulations While you may not think that building an RC boat would require any sort of compliance. However, this is not true. While there are not many rules, those that exist are important. 

The two most important regulations involve vessel size and engine safety. RC model boats are generally not permitted to transport passengers. Owners are also required to maintain RC boat motors to reduce emissions and prevent oil and fuel leaks. 

There are clubs and guilds that help RC boat builders and hobbyists comply with the rules. These organizations are known as model shipwright guilds. These groups an excellent resource for important building information. 

Model shipwright guilds are social groupings intended to allow more experienced ship modellers the opportunity to pass on their knowledge to new members; to allow members of all levels of expertise to exchange new ideas, as well as serving as social function. 

Some model shipwright guilds have been incorporated into government and Naval facilities, achieving a semi-official status as a clearinghouse for information on naval history and ship design. The USS Constitution Museum operates a model shipwright guild from the Charlestown Navy Yard, adjacent to the berth for the vessel itself.  
RC Boat Safety Last, but certainly not least, is safety. You might not be out on the water in person. However, you are responsible for your RC boat at all times. 

Here are a few simple tips to help you reduce the risk of accidents when you operate your RC boat. 

- Pay attention at all times. While you might be an excellent RC operator, the operator next to you might be terrible. - Maintain and check your boat prior to use. Inspect for oil and fuel leaks as well as any damage to the vessel. - Non-model vessels have the right of way. Do not cause an accident by distracting others. 

If you lose control of your boat and cause injuries or damage, you will be held responsible. Many lakes have restricted RC boat access as a result of careless operator behavior.",
Rock Climbing,"Rock Climbing Information Introduction The great thing about hobbies is that they come in all shapes and sizes. Rock climbing is perhaps one of my favorite things to participate in because it reminds me of my childhood. Let’s just say that I am that kid down the street that was constantly climbing trees, fences, and pretty much anything that was in anyway climbable. For me, I fell in love with rock climbing on a purely amateur level because it allowed my inner child to burst free for an hour or so. There really anything cooler than scaling a vertical wall as fast as you can only to repel back down it as fast as your partner will let you. Sure there are some aspects that will discourage a lot of people from joining the hobby, the physical aspects appear to be especially daunting, but for those that are physically able, rock climbing is a great way to stay fit and stay active. The best part is that with a pretty limited amount of equipment and a lot of motivation, you can have a really great time with friends and family. There is also a lot of competition in the outdoor industry related with rock climbing, which adds to its popular image. Rock climbing is a challenging sport that involves tons of motivation, dedication, and perseverance. With all of these aspects, rock climbing is within reach of most people, and although it looks tough at times, it is a great hobby to get into. 
What is Rock Climbing? In its most basic form, Rock climbing is essentially nothing more than climbing rock walls. Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. It seems almost silly to mention, but the goal of rock climbing is to reach the summit of a formation, or the endpoint of a pre-defined route. Rock climbing competitions have objectives of completing the route in the quickest possible time or the farthest along an ever increasingly harder route. Rock climbing is similar to scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, but climbing is generally differentiated because of the use of hands to support the climber`s weight as well as to provide balance. 

Rock climbing is a very physically and mentally demanding sport, and one that often tests a climber`s strength, endurance, agility, and balance along with his mental control. The sad fact about this sport is that perfect is a key because if you slip while climbing in the wild, most falls will be fatal. Since it can be a very dangerous sport, the knowledge of proper climbing techniques and usage of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes and practice. While not an Olympic event, rock climbing is recognized by the International Olympic Committee as a sport. But just because it is a nationally accepted sport doesn’t mean that it isn’t something that can just be done for fun in your home town. Most cities will have indoor artificial walls that climbers of all ability levels can practice and have fun on. Plus it is one sport that is so much fun once you start going that you’ll forget that it is also a great physical and mental workout. 
Required Rock Climbing Equipment Although it is quite possible to go rock climbing without any equipment at all, it is by no means recommended to do so. Rock climbing equipment isn’t designed to just make you look cool, but it is actually designed to keep you as safe as possible in case an accident occurs. Although there are many things you can purchase, the necessities are climbing shoes, rope, general-purpose devices for connecting things, nylon cord, harnesses for connecting climbers to things, devices for applying friction to the rope, and devices for wedging into the rock. These are items that are required for outdoor rock climbing, and even though they are the same items needed for indoor climbing, most establishments will provide the necessary equipment, teach you how to use the equipment, and they will more often than not go through a quick safety orientation prior to letting you climb in their facility. The most important part of any physically challenging hobby or spot is to stay safe. 

The most useful piece of climbing equipment is a pair of climbing shoes. This seems like a strange addition for most people new to the hobby because most people who try rock climbing for the first few times just wear normal running shoes. After they try climbing with a proper pair of climbing shoes, there simply is no turning back, with many improvements in shoe design alone, these shoes have allowed climbers to climb many things previously unclimbable. The modern climbing shoe has a stiff, smooth rubber sole that protects the foot from sharp, rough rock, and provides more friction than a bare foot. Climbing shoes fit tightly to prevent the foot from sliding around within the shoe, which makes them uncomfortable at first, but the improved friction and control they afford far outweigh the discomfort. A pair of these shoes cost between $100 and $150, which is about the same cost of a regular pair of running shoes. 

A modern climbing rope is the key piece of safety equipment. These modern ropes are made of kernmantle construction, consisting of continuous braided nylon fibers, the kern, surrounded by a continuous braided nylon outer sheath, the mantle. Such construction is superior to the more traditional laid rope, three large strands twisted together, because the outer sheath protects the inner core, where most of the strength lies, from the elements. Climbing rope is dynamic, and by this I mean that it is able to stretch a bit under tension because the rope must stop falling climbers. If the rope did not stretch, a falling climber would be jerked suddenly as the rope stops him, which can be quite painful. With a dynamic rope, the rope slows the climber’s fall more gently. Climbing ropes are usually ten to eleven millimeters in diameter and fifty meters (about 165 feet) long. These ropes typically cost between $100 and $180. 

Carabiners, used all the time in climbing, are rings of solid aluminum with a spring-loaded gate that allows them to be opened while climbing. Normally, the spring holds the gate closed, but the gate can be opened to admit a rope. Carabiners are inexpensive, typically ranging from between $5 and $20, strong, most are rated to hold at least 20 kN, about 2.2 tons, and extremely versatile. It is safe to say that virtually every climbing technique uses carabiners. A carabiner is safe until its gate opens. To increase security, two carabiners can be used in tandem with their gates reversed, which would make it far less likely that something would cause both gates to open at once. 

To attach herself to a rope, a climber uses a sewn harness, which may be the most important safety device used in rock climbing. A typical harness has a wide nylon belt for the waist and a pair of leg loops for the thighs. When a climber is supported by such a harness, most of her weight is placed on her legs, rather than her waist or back, making it fairly comfortable to hang in. Many variations are available from various manufacturers. More expensive harnesses have more padding and are typically well worth the little bit of extra cash. Adjustable-diameter leg loops are another option that is popular amongst those within the hobby. Sewn harnesses will often cost between $30 and $80. 

A belayer`s is another very important piece of equipment whose job is to hold the rope to stop a falling climber, which is difficult without the aid of a belay device, an object capable of stopping the rope or passing it through smoothly. There are many such belay devices, and are all easy to use, making them very safe. One common belay device is the figure-eight: two metal rings about an inch in diameter joined in the shape of an 8. A loop of rope is passed through one of the rings, then around and under the other. The ring without the rope is clipped to the belayer`s harness with a locking carabiner. When pulled tight, the rope is bent into four ninety degree angles in the space of a few inches, making it very difficult to move. A figure-eight costs between $15 and $20, and is worth every penny. A disadvantage of the figure-eight is its tendency to twist the rope as it passes through. Another style of belay device, typified by the ATC (Air Traffic Controller), avoids this problem by twisting the rope less. These devices typically have two holes just large enough to pass a loop of rope through. The loop of rope is attached to a carabiner such that when one end of the rope is pulled, the belay device approaches the carabiner and pinches the rope. This provides highly variable rope friction, ranging from very little to enough to support a falling climber. 
Conclusion Rock climbing is simply one of my favorite hobbies to take part in because it is unique, challenging, and quite simply a great time. The best thing about the hobby is that it has grown to the point where nearly every city will have at least one climbing wall somewhere to learn from. The great thing is that there are usually multiple sections of walls in these facilities that allow for beginners and advanced members to practice their hobby at the same location. There is quite frankly no better way to learn how to rock climb then from someone already within the hobby. You will quickly learn the ins and outs of the spot in a hands on manner, and you will realize how fun it actually is. With the sport’s popularity, there are many books and web sites available for beginners, but there really isn’t any better way to learn then from someone within the hobby. At first the walls will be a challenge, but as you progress through the different difficulty levels, it will only be a matter of time before you are scaling real walls in an outdoor setting. Even if you are not in the best shape, or if you aren’t the most muscular man or woman around, rock climbing is still a very accessible sport for you to take part in. With great endurance, dedication, and perseverance, anyone is capable of joining this hobby, and there is no time like today.",

"LomographyA photographic image style known for its colorful, unique, and sometimes blurry images.","Introduction to LomographyOnce upon a time, photography was a combination of skill and luck. Now, digital cameras and photo-editing software have made it possible for just about anyone to take the perfect photograph. Images are automatically balanced for ideal lighting conditions and balanced color, and both subject and background are in crisp, clear focus. You can even preview the picture immediately after taking it, and can discard any images that don’t meet your expectations. In addition, after the images are downloaded into a computer, you can crop them or edit them using a wide variety of tools and features. A simple photograph can become anything you want it to be. But sometimes perfection isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Life is full of detours and accidents, and occasionally an accident can bring an unexpected gift. This is what happened in the case of lomography.Lomography is the commercial trademark of Lomographische AG, Austria for products and services related to photography. The name is inspired by the former state-run optics manufacturer LOMO PLC of Saint Petersburg, Russia. LOMO PLC created and produced the 35 mm LOMO LC-A Compact Automat camera — which became the centerpiece of Lomography`s marketing and sales activities. This camera was loosely based upon the Cosina CX-1 and introduced in the early 1980s. What is Lomography? They say that necessity is the mother of invention, and nowhere is that more true than in the area of lomography. In a nutshell, lomography started with the last-minute purchase of a cheap tourist camera.In 1992, two Austrian students on holiday in Prague found that they had forgotten their cameras. They purchased a modest 35mm compact Soviet-made point-and-shoot camera and used this to take photographs of their vacation. The camera was a LOMO Kompakt Automat, or LC-A, produced by the LOMO plant in Russia. In many ways, it was the opposite of digital cameras today. It had a narrow depth of field, producing images with sharp subjects and blurred backgrounds. It also had light leaks and produced images with a certain blurred or grainy quality. Color reproduction varied, often producing images with intense and unusual color saturation. When the film was developed, the two students were pleasantly surprised with the result.The students were were ""charmed by the unique, colorful, and sometimes blurry"" images that the camera produced. They went on to experiment with the LC-A, producing a series of artistically interesting, experimental and unorthodox snapshots. The quirky, spontaneous photographic style of the shots produced by the LC-A had an instant artistic appeal, and people became interested in these photos and the camera that produced them. Recognizing a good thing when they saw it, the students eventually flew to St. Petersburg and negotiated a contract for worldwide distribution of the LOMO LC-A.People worldwide liked the LOMO style and coined the term “lomography” for photos taken with the LOMO LC-A. The restrictions of the camera and the unpredictability of results have resulted in a fun, spontaneous approach to photography, which involves taking as many photographs (or Lomographs) as possible, in unlikely situations and from unusual angles, and having them developed as cheaply as possible. The results are colorful, quirky, off-the-wall photos, often featuring unfamiliar subjects, double exposures, and unusual camera angles. People began to experiment with using outdated film and cross-processing (developing color snapshots using chemistry designed for photographic slide film).The trend caught on. Art exhibitions featuring lomography were staged in major cities worldwide, including Moscow, New York, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Vienna, and Tokyo, as well as others. The photos were mounted on panels to form a collage of many thousands of colorful images, making a powerful combined artistic statement.So, to put it briefly, lomography is the art of using low-tech, plastic toy cameras to capture images that are quaintly blurred, over-saturated with color, quirky and unique. It has been embraced worldwide by artists, professionals and amateurs alike, who are looking for a new approach to snapshot photography. In today’s high-tech, complex and controlled world, the simplicity and unpredictability of lomography are part of its appeal. History of Lomography The first LOMO LC-A camera was developed in St. Petersburg, Russia, in the early 1980s. The mass-produced consumer camera was distributed in the Soviet Union and exported to other European countries. In the early 1990s, one of the cameras was purchased by students in Prague, who then went on to popularize both the camera and the artistic style it inspired.In 1992, the Lomographic Society was founded in Vienna, Austria, and began to spread the message of lomography around the world. Exhibitions, parties, workshops, and tours were organized, and demand for the LOMO LC-A camera began to explode.Unfortunately, as worldwide demand for the LOMO camera was increasing, the fall of the Soviet Union meant that fewer Russians could afford cameras, and the LOMO plant ceased production in December 1994. Fans of lomography entered into negotiations with the manufacturer, and production was eventually resumed in 1997. However, despite its worldwide fan base, the Russian company continued to struggle and eventually ceased production in 2005. The camera is now produced in China, as the LOMO LC-A+.The year 2009 marked the 25th anniversary of the LOMO LC-A, and lomographers worldwide celebrated with exhibitions, parties, and workshops.Today, the lomography community boasts over 500,000 members worldwide. All of them share the basic lomographic philosophy - carry your camera everywhere, shoot fast, don’t over-think your shot, be open-minded and non-judgmental towards your environment, get close in to your subject, be spontaneous, and don’t be afraid to share your photographic experiences with the worldwide lomographic community.",https://www.discoverahobby.com/lomography#
Model Rockets,"Model Rockets Information  Introduction Many modeling kits will involve bringing out the detail of a vehicle that the model was based on. There are working versions of those models, but those don’t focus on the physics involved like the model rocket. 

Model rocketry does not involve detailed paint jobs or even hours of construction time. In practice, building a model rocket is a fairly straight forward process. Well, straight forward for those who have an idea what they’re doing. When it comes to this hobby three steps take place. 

The first step is assembling the rocket correctly. Second, you must find a place to safely launch the rocket. And third, you will launch and retrieve the rocket. 
Parts of the rocket Instead of a wide array of tools and small parts to glue together, a rocket follows a very basic design. Remember, the functionality of the rocket is more important than the detail that goes into a rocket. 

No matter the size, the principles of rocketry hold true. It’s learning how to apply those principles properly that is the trick. The following is a breakdown of a rocket then more specifically its engine. We’ll look at each piece and talk about what purpose it serves. Afterwards, you should get a good sense that a rocket uses no extra parts. It is straight forward in its design and functionality.  
The Rocket The top of a rocket should be the nose cone. This piece is responsible for reducing aerodynamic resistance on the rocket. This resistance is referred to as drag or aerodynamic drag. Some people may decorate this piece, but that is not necessary. 

The next piece along the body of the rocket is called the payload. This is what houses the cargo of the rocket. In model rockets this is often where the retrieval unit is stored. 

The last part of the rocket’s body is called the body tube. This portion of the rocket holds the engine and gives a mounting surface for the fins. Other smaller parts can be found in here. Those pieces will be indicated later. 

Moving to the inside of the rocket, you have the engine. This is not like a typical vehicle engine. Rather, it is a propulsion unit that drives the rocket forward. It is located inside the body tube. 

Next to the engine you’ll have the thrust ring. This piece keeps the engine from shooting through the rocket itself. Consider it as a type of bracing that the rocket has against the engine. It is also located inside the body tube. 

Moving towards the nose, you’ll have the wadding. This is a protective material that keeps the engine from burning the retrieval unit. As seen later, the retrieval unit is very often flammable so requires this protection. 

This brings us to the retrieval unit. There are a wide variety of types of retrieval units. They could involve gliding wings, helicopter style propellers, streamers, etc. The most commonly known retrieval unit is a small parachute. Most of these units will be deployed when the rocket splits in half. 

To accomplish this, an ejection charge is used. This provides the proper deployment of the retrieval device. This is actually part of the engine. 

Connecting the retrieval unit to the rocket are the shroud lines. These lines are typically packed in with the retrieval unit. 

Since a sudden deployment of a retrieval unit would most likely destroy a rocket, there needs to be something that absorbs the shock of the impact. For this purpose, there is the shock chord. The shock chord connects the cone to the body and anchors the shroud lines. 

The rocket will also have a small tube called a launch lug. This serves to guide the rocket at launch. It works by fitting over a launch rod. The launch rod is not part of the rocket. The rod is approximately thirty six inches long and can be used to point the rocket in a direction. The launch lug provides this important guidance that the rocket needs. 

Finally, there are the fins. Once the rocket reaches proper speed and wind resistance, these are the only thing that keep its trajectory. The proper speed is roughly thirty miles an hour. This speed needs to be attained before the rocket the end of the launch rod. If not, the fins may not have enough influence over the rocket to guide it. This is why they don’t recommend modifying a rocket kit since all the specifics have been worked out. Tampering with the rocket may result in an unexpected result.  
The engine The engine or motor of a rocket is the most important element of a rocket. It provides the thrust needed to achieve launch which is the main goal behind building one of these kits. Because of this fact, extra details about the engine are presented here. 

The ejection charge as stated before releases the retrieval unit through the proper apogee. The apogee is the opening designed to open to release or eject something specifically. In this case, it will release the retrieval device like a parachute. 

Since the ejection charge is a substance rather than a piece or part, it requires a container to hold it. This container is called a retainer cap in a rocket. Its only function is to hold the charge while it waits to be ignited. 

Because you don’t want the retrieval device to deploy as the rocket launches, an element is needed to prevent immediate ignition of the ejection element. This element is called the delay element. Not only does it act like a time delay fuse, but it also provides a smoke trail for your eyes to follow. 

Now we move onto the propellant. This is the chemical compound that will provide thrust to your engine. When it burns it creates a gas exhaust that takes up more room than the space it’s in. Therefore, it must find a way out. This force that seeks release gives the rocket its thrust. 

Thrust alone will launch the rocket a short ways up. In order to intensify the thrust model rockets come with a ceramic disk with a hole in it. This piece is called the nozzle. By forcing escaping exhaust gasses through a much smaller hole, the speed at which the gas escapes needs to increase. Remember, it still needs to displace the same volume of material. Therefore, you have a chain reaction. 

To better understand how this works, let’s use the example of a water hose. When you turn it on water begins pouring out. Consider the water thrust provided by the propellant. Now put your hand over the end of the hose. As you can tell, you can’t really stop the water from coming out. So it tries to escape through any small opening your hand might provide. Since the same amount of water needs to come out the end result is stronger streams of water. This is how a nozzle works. 

The last part of the rocket’s engine is the mechanism used to ignite the propellant. Since it’s very dangerous to use hand held ignition devices igniter wires are provided for this purpose. This will allow remote launching of your rocket. 
What you need Very little time and energy is needed to build the model. Beginners may take some time with their first rocket though. The real challenge for many is in finding a safe and open area to launch your rocket. 

Sure there are a few things you can do to point the rocket in a direction you want to go, but there can be factors that change its course. Wind speed can play a major factor in disrupting a straight trajectory for your craft. It also can play havoc on how the retrieval unit will function. 

When selecting a suitable place, follow all the guidelines that are outlined in the paperwork included with the rocket. Due to the potentially dangerous elements that go into a rocket make sure you follow the instructions on properly storing it if you don’t plan to put it together right away. 

Many times hobby stores will recommend a smaller rocket for those just getting into the hobby. This is good advice to follow. For one it is a more affordable option especially if you end up making mistakes. 
Warning It is highly stressed that if you are interested in rocketry to purchase and use kits. Home made rockets tend to lack the fundamental elements that make a rocket work. Those who try have a long trial and error phase that they go through to figure the process out. 

This phase may involve serious injury and damage. In addition, it will often turn out to be ten times more expensive than if you had just bought a kit. If you do wish to make personalized rocket, it’s recommended you seek an educational background to help you in this endeavor. 
Conclusion Model rocketry is a dynamic hobby that doesn’t require the amount of patience that other model kits need in abundance. Since they do have dangerous elements to them, it’s recommended that you make sure to follow every safety instruction that comes with the kit. 

More advanced practitioners of the hobby can always find bigger rockets to launch. However, many times bigger rockets will require licenses to own and operate. This is also a hobby you can share with others. People of all ages love to see the grace and power displayed when science is at work.",
Graffiti,"Graffiti Information  Intro Street art is any art developed in public spaces — that is, ""in the streets"" — though the term usually refers to unsanctioned art, as opposed to government sponsored initiatives. The term can include traditional graffiti artwork, stencil graffiti, sticker art, wheatpasting and street poster art, video projection, art intervention, guerrilla art, flash mobbing and street installations. Typically, the term street art or the more specific post-graffiti is used to distinguish contemporary public-space artwork from territorial graffiti, vandalism, and corporate art. 

Artists have challenged art by situating it in non-art contexts. ‘Street’ artists do not aspire to change the definition of an artwork, but rather to question the existing environment with its own language. They attempt to have their work communicate with everyday people about socially relevant themes in ways that are informed by esthetic values without being imprisoned by them. 

The motivations and objectives that drive street artists are as varied as the artists themselves. There is a strong current of activism and subversion in urban art. Street art can be a powerful platform for reaching the public, and frequent themes include adbusting, subvertising and other culture jamming, the abolishment of private property and reclaiming the streets. Other street artists simply see urban space as an untapped format for personal artwork, while others may appreciate the challenges and risks that are associated with installing illicit artwork in public places. However the universal theme in most, if not all street art, is that adapting visual artwork into a format which utilizes public space, allows artists who may otherwise feel disenfranchised, to reach a much broader audience than traditional artwork and galleries normally allow. 
Some Terms Like all hobbies, street art has its own language, some of which can be difficult to decipher. Listed below is a short sampling of commonly used street art words. 

Bite - To steal another artist`s ideas or lettering schemes. Seasoned artists will often complain about toys that bite their work. 

Legal- A graffiti piece or production that is made with permission. 

King - The opposite of toys, kings or queens (feminine) are writers especially respected among other writers. This is sometimes separated into ""inside"" and ""outside"" kings. To be a king of the inside means you have most tags inside trains (to ""own the inside""), and to ""own the outside"" means having most pieces on the train surface. One should note that there are kings of style among a variety of other categories and the term is regionally subjective. Self-declared kings will often incorporate crowns into their pieces; a commonly used element of style. However the people must be very self-confident when doing it, since other great writers tend to slash out self-proclaimed kings who have not gained that rank yet in their eyes. Typically a writer can only become a king if another king with that status already has expressed so 

Knight - A respected graffiti writer whose skills are still progressing. They are not as good as a king, but are much better than a toy. 

Landmark - When an individual ""tags"" on a certain location that becomes very difficult for removal. Can also be a location that will not get noticed too much, therefore it stays on longer. 

Massacre - When municipal authorities take down or cover up an accumulation of tags and pieces, leaving a blank space. 

Tag (Scribble) - A stylized signature, normally done in one color. The simplest and most prevalent type of graffiti, a tag is often done in a color that contrasts sharply with its background. 

Toy - Used as an adjective to describe poor work, or as a noun meaning an inexperienced or unskilled writer. Graffiti writers usually use this as a derogatory term for new writers in the scene or writers that are old to the scene that still do not have any skill or reputation. 

Up - Writers become up when their work becomes widespread and well-known. 
A Little History, Please The function, form and media of public art have increasingly broadened during the 20th and 21st centuries. Because street art is so often politically inspired, it was frequently used as propaganda. Quite possibly the most obvious example of this would be Joseph Stalin’s use of public art for his Socialist Realism art movement. He wished to boost the country’s drive for independence in the early part of the 20th century. They sought to glorify the Communist government through sculpture, paintings and posters featuring heroic poses. 

Adolf Hitler also made use of public art when the Nazis held photographic exhibitions that were designed to demean and demonize the Jewish population. 

In Mexico during the 1920s and 1930s, painters like Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jose Clemente Orozco helped to create a Mexican Mural Renaissance, during which public buildings were decorated by large-scale fresco painting, typically with a nationalist political message. 

Graffiti is derived from the Italian word `graffio` meaning, to scratch, and refers to illegal street art sprayed or painted on buildings, in public urban areas, by freelance street artists. One of the new contemporary art movements, it includes various types such as territorial graffiti, aggressive guerrilla art (now referred to as `post-graffiti art`), and stencil graffiti. By comparison, the term `street art` encompasses traditional graffiti imagery. Techniques 

Whereas traditional graffiti artists have primarily used free-hand aerosol paints to produce their works, ""street art"" encompasses many other media and techniques, including: LED art, mosaic tiling, murals, stencil art, sticker art, street installations, and yarn bombing. 

LED art- LED Art is form of light art constructed from light-emitting diodes. Many artists that use LEDs are guerilla artists, incorporating LEDs to produce temporary pieces in public places. LEDs are very inexpensive to purchase and have become a new way to make street art. LEDs are, among others, used in installation art, sculptural pieces and interactive artworks. 

There was a famous incident in 2007 known as the 2007 Boston Bomb Scare that involved the use of LEDs caused by a guerilla marketing campaign. An advertising firm working for Turner Broadcasting System Inc. to promote Aqua Teen Hunger Force, one of the networks television shows, hired two artists to produce art for the ad campaign. The artists used a character from the television show (a cartoon) referred to as a Mooninite as their imagery. The Mooninite was turned into an LED sign and was stuck to many locations in 10 cities. However, Boston was the only city that reacted by shutting down bridges and bringing in bomb squads to remove the LEDs. The majority of the light boards were removed and the artists were arrested. The artists were not charged. 

Mosaic tiling- Mosaic is an art form which uses small pieces of materials placed together to create a unified whole. The materials commonly used are marble or other stone, glass, pottery, mirror or foil-backed glass, or shells. 

The term for each piece of material is Tessera. The term for the spaces in between where the grout goes is the interstices. Andamento is the word used to describe the movement and flow of Tesserae. The `opus`, the Latin for ‘work’, is the way in which the pieces are cut and placed varies and is known. 

A mural is any piece of artwork painted directly on a wall, ceiling or other large permanent surface. Murals typically depict scenery, groupings of people or animals, or cityscapes. 

Stencil Art makes use of a paper, cardboard, or other media to create an image or text that is easily reproducible. The desired design is cut out of the selected medium and then the image is transferred to a surface through the use of spray paint or roll-on paint. 

The process of stenciling involves applying paint across a stencil to form an image on a surface below. Sometimes multiple layers of stencils are used on the same image to add colors or create the illusion of depth. 

Stencil graffiti is probably one of the fastest growing forms of street art worldwide because of its versatility. It can be a simple thought or picture or a large scale piece. It is cheap to create and quick and easy to put up. Sometimes, they are the political or social opinions of the artist, often showing images of favorite singers, or something like a political figure they dislike, with horns growing out of their head. You can go down any metropolitan street and find many examples of stencil street art- it has truly become a part of living in an urban area. 

Street artists can use this medium to create detailed pieces because they are made ahead of time. Once the artist arrives at the area they want to decorate, it is just a matter or spraying or rolling over the stencil. With the advent of computers and printers, a street artist can create their masterpiece very easily, often using familiar faces or symbols, such as the peace sign. 

Political issues of the specific time and region are often the subjects of stenciled street art...a bit like political cartoons. The now-famous red and blue “HOPE” poster of Barack Obama’s face was created by a street artist. Sticker Art- (also known as sticker bombing, slap tagging, and sticker tagging) is a form of street art in which an image or message is publicly displayed using stickers. These stickers may promote a political agenda, comment on a policy or issue, or comprise an avant garde art campaign. This form of street art allows graffiti tags to instantly be placed anywhere accessible, with a much lower risk of apprehension and less damage to the target surface than is possible with other types of street art, such as wheat-pasting posters or spray paint. 

Many different types of stickers are used to create sticker art. Inexpensively-purchased and free stickers such as ""hello my name is"" name tags or USPS mailing labels are often used with hand-drawn art. Sticker artists can also easily design and print thousands of stickers at low cost using a commercial printing service or at home with a computer printer and self-adhesive labels. Most well known artists print their designs onto adhesive vinyl. Most adhesive vinyl has an aggressive permanent adhesive but all are waterproof and fade resistant. A handful of these artists raise the bar by printing their designs on destructible adhesive vinyl. Destructible adhesive vinyl is near impossible to remove from the surface it is adhered to once applied. If destructible adhesive vinyl is tampered with harshly it simply cracks and chips away in tiny increments making it extremely tedious to handle and remove. 

Street Installations are a growing trend within the ""street art"" movement. Whereas conventional street art/graffiti is done on surfaces/walls ""street installations"" use 3-D objects/space to interfere with the urban environment. Like graffiti, it is non-permission based and once the object/sculpture is installed it is left there by the artist. 

""Hitchhikers"" are one popular form of street installation happening predominantly in NYC where paintings on wood are installed on to street signs using metal bolts. Other artists such as Leon Reid IV and Brad Downey use objects removed from the urban environment that are then sculpted through changing/reshaping and afterwards these sculptures are reinserted back into the city. 

Since the late 1990s, the New York City-based art duo Skewville has produced their own brand of installation work, including wood sneakers tossed on lines, fake air-conditioning vents with words such as ""FAKE"" carved into them and other optical illusions that include the sculptural use of wood pallets and electrical piping. 

Ghost bikes are memorial street installations for bicyclists killed by automobiles. The bicycles are painted white and locked to street signs. 

A roundabout dog is a homemade street installation placed in roundabouts, a phenomenon that occurred all over Sweden in 2006. 

Yarn bombing is a type of graffiti or street art that employs colorful displays of knitted or crocheted cloth rather than paint or chalk. While yarn installations – called yarn bombs or knit bombs – may last for years, they are considered non-permanent, and, unlike graffiti, can be easily removed if necessary. The practice is believed to have originated in the U.S. with Texas knitters trying to find a creative way to use their leftover and unfinished knitting projects, but it has since spread worldwide. 

While other forms of graffiti may be expressive, decorative, territorial, socio-political commentary, advertising or vandalism, yarn bombing is almost exclusively about reclaiming and personalizing sterile or cold public places. Dave Cole is a contemporary sculpture artist who practiced knitting as graffiti for a large-scale public art installation in Melbourne Australia for the Big West Arts Festival in 2009. The work was vandalized the night of its completion. An anonymous knitter or group of knitters dubbed the ""Midnight Knitter"" has been decorating branches and poles under the cover of darkness in Cape May, New Jersey. 

Tagging - it is generally done in one color and is sometimes used to mark a specific area. They are often done with either spray paint or a thick marker. Gangs frequently use tags to distinguish one territory from the other. To the street artist, a tag may be more complex, using background images and multiple colors, creating unique displays. 

Traditional graffiti also has increasingly been adopted as a method for advertising; its trajectory has even in some cases led its artists to work on contract as graphic artists for corporations. Nevertheless, street art is a label often adopted by artists who wish to keep their work unaffiliated and strongly political. Street artists are those whose work is still largely done without official approval in public areas. 

For these reasons street art is sometimes considered ""post-graffiti"" and sometimes even ""neo-graffiti."" Street art can be found around the world and street artists often travel to other countries foreign to them so they can spread their designs.   
Notable Street Artists Banksy 

Banksy is the pseudonym of a prolific British graffiti artist, political activist and painter, whose identity is unconfirmed. His satirical street art and subversive epigrams combine irreverent dark humour with graffiti done in a distinctive stencilling technique. Such artistic works of political and social commentary have been featured on streets, walls, and bridges of cites throughout the world. 

Banksy`s work was born out of the Bristol underground scene which involved collaborations between artists and musicians. According to author and graphic designer Tristan Manco, Banksy ""was born in 1974 and raised in Bristol, England. The son of a photocopier technician, he trained as a butcher but became involved in graffiti during the great Bristol aerosol boom of the late 1980s."" Observers have noted that his style is similar to Blek le Rat, who began to work with stencils in 1981 in Paris and members of the anarcho-punk band Crass who maintained a graffiti stencil campaign on the London Tube System in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 

Banksy does not sell photos of street graffiti directly himself, however art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder. Banksy`s first film, Exit Through the Gift Shop, billed as ""the world`s first street art disaster movie"", made its debut at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. 

Blek Le Rat 

Blek le Rat was born Xavier Prou in Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris in 1952. He is considered the godfather of stencil graffiti art. He studied painting and architecture. He began his artwork in Paris in 1981. Since then he has had a great influence on today`s graffiti and ""guerilla art"" movements, his main motivation being social consciousness and the desire to bring art to the people. British graffiti artist Banksy has acknowledged Blek`s influence saying ""every time I think I`ve painted something slightly original, I find out that Blek Le Rat has done it as well, only twenty years earlier."" 

In October 2006, Blek le Rat had his first solo U.K. exhibition in London at the Leonard Street Gallery. Blek also had an exhibition in December 2009 at the Metro Gallery in Melbourne, a centre of street art in Australia. The exhibition entitled; ""Le Ciel Est Bleu, La Vie Est Belle"" (The sky is blue, life is beautiful), features wooden panels, canvas, screen-print and photographs. It traces the artist`s oeuvre from the early 1980s to the present. 

Dondi White 

Donald J. White (nicknamed Dondi by his mother) was born in New York on April 7, 1961. He is one of five sons born to African American and Italian parents. He was raised in Brooklyn, in the East New York section. As a young child, Dondi had pet pigeons that he flew, and participated in normal city boy activities, like playing stickball, riding go-carts and playing ball with his brothers. 

Dondi’s family was a very strong moral and ethical Catholic family, and they tried to pass these values on to their sons. Such things as cursing, talking back or disrespecting their elders were not tolerated in the White household. They were encouraged to say their prayers, go to Mass, and live a good life. Some of this wholesome upbringing is reflected in Dondi’s work. Such things as his childhood tricycle along with religious iconography and terms are prevalent in his work. 

Dondi White was a very methodical artist. He planned every part of any artwork before beginning it. He kept sketchbooks full of details and outlines of his work. He would only begin a piece of street art when he was certain that all aspects of it would turn out perfectly. 

Part of Dondi White’s success is due in part to his friendship with a photographer named Martha Cooper. Before they met, Ms. Cooper had taken a picture of a piece of White’s work that eventually appeared in the background of a New York Post cover. Cooper had taken a picture of Dondi`s ""Children of the Grave"" trains, which ""are considered among the most famous and iconic ever painted by any writer"" in New York, according to Style Master General. Her photos of his work appear in a book titled Subway Art. 

Man One 

Man One is the founder of a street art gallery named Crewest Gallery in the downtown Gallery Row area of Los Angeles. He began his street art career on the streets of Los Angeles California. Man One boasts a B.A. in Fine Arts from Loyola University where he found a new way to change the world through street art. 

His artwork has been displayed in several exhibitions both in the United States and other countries, including five one man shows and his artwork can be seen in several galleries, including Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, California and Parco Museum in Tokyo, Japan. 

Man One has worked commercially, designing murals and creating concepts for MTV, Adidas, ESPN, Coca-Cola and the Metro Transit Authority. His artwork has also appeared in several magazines such as New York Magazine and Airbrush Action, and has been highlighted in the Washington Post. 

Keith Haring 

Keith Haring graduated from Kutztown Area Senior High School in 1976 and in 1978 he moved to New York to attend the School of Visual Arts. There, he expanded his artistic vision and began to create graffiti-inspired large designs. 

In the late 70s, he was an active member of the New York club scene, collaborating with street artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, better known as “Samo”. By 1980 Keith had taken up drawing and eventually invented a new mural style involving cartoon looking figures who seemed to be engaged in ultra physical activity. 

Keith was a rock star among artists during the 80s, working and showing his work all across the United States, Asia and many parts of Europe. During this time, his art reflected iconography of Islam and Japanese art. 

Much to the chagrin of his fellows, Keith opened a store in 1986 called The Pop Shop, in the Soho district of New York making his art available on buttons, posters and the like. While he received much criticism for this move, one of his mentors, Andy Warhol, approved of the venture. During this time, he also created fabulous murals on the Berlin Wall, painted on diverse locations such as cars and hot air balloons. 

Tragically, during the height of his popularity, Keith contracted the AIDS virus and died from complications in 1988 at the age of 31. 

The Obama “Hope” Poster 

This particular piece of art bears its own section because it was created by a street artist, Shepard Fairey. He made his posters to support Barack Obama’s candidacy for President. The New Yorker art critic Peter Schjeldahl called the poster ""the most efficacious American political illustration since `Uncle Sam Wants You`"". 

However, the Obama campaign would not claim any direct affiliation with the artwork because it had been ""perpetuated illegally"" and independently by the street artist. Although the campaign officially disavowed any involvement in the creation or popularization of the poster, Fairey has commented in interviews that he was in communication with campaign officials during the period immediately following the poster`s release. Fairey has stated that the original version featured the word ""PROGRESS"" instead of the word ""HOPE,"" and that within weeks of its release, the campaign requested that he issue a new version, keeping the powerful image of Obama`s face but captioning it with the word ""HOPE"". The campaign openly embraced the revised poster along with two additional Fairey posters that featured the words ""CHANGE"" and ""VOTE"". 

In February 2008, Fairey received a letter of thanks from Barack Obama for his contribution to the campaign. The letter stated: 

“I would like to thank you for using your talent in support of my campaign. The political messages involved in your work have encouraged Americans to believe they can change the status-quo. Your images have a profound effect on people, whether seen in a gallery or on a stop sign. I am privileged to be a part of your artwork and proud to have your support.” -- Barack Obama, February 22, 2008 

The original mixed media artwork is in the Smithsonian Institution’s National Portrait Gallery.   
Tips And Tricks - Plan out what it is you want to create. Draw it in a sketchpad, or, if you are re-creating something already existing, take a good snapshot of it. 

- Make several copies of your sketches or photograph. This is particularly important if there is going to be more than one person working on your piece of artwork. 

- Use a grid to plot out your painting. A popular technique is to use large graphing paper, but you can grid it any way you like. 

- Label your grids, letters on one side, numbers on the other, so that a particular square can be referred to as “B-9” or what have you. 

- Glue your photocopies to a piece of cardboard or other stiff paper, so they will be easy to use. 

- Make sure your work area is free of debris like dirt, leaves, trash, etc. 

- Start at the top of the work area and work your way down. 

- Always sign your work. 

These next few tips are from Banksy in regard to creating street art which is not legal. 

- A standard can of paint will produce 50 or so medium sized stencils. This means you can become very famous in a small town for not a lot of money. 

- Spray the stencils from a distance of about 8 inches. 

- The best way to become what he calls “invisible” is to wear an orange vest like construction workers wear and an IPod. That way when the authorities come to check out the legitimacy of your work, all you have to do is complain about the hourly wage. 

- When explaining yourself to the police, be as reasonable as possible.   
Conclusion Street art, depending on who you speak to, is considered either vandalism or personal expression. It can be used to make a political statement, or just for the beautification of the area. Beginning is not that difficult, all you really need is a can of spray paint or some stencils and an open area in which to paint. Many street artists have progressed to creating legal street art, such as Dondi White, and ManOne has even opened a gallery in tribute to the art form.",
Film Making,"Film Making Information Most people these days have a camcorder that they use to capture special moments. Filmmaking happens to be one of the most popular hobbies, with thousands of novice filmmakers looking for advice on the Internet to learn how to go about it. Read on to find out everything you ever wanted to know about filmmaking.What do I need?
Choosing a camera All of us would like to own the coolest camera that’s sleek and has all the latest features required for great filmmaking. Most hobbyists fail to understand that what’s captured on the camera is more important than the make and model of camera you have. 

Choosing the camera formats or what are otherwise called as tape formats can be overwhelming with the wide range available in the market. You need to carefully evaluate the pros and cons of each one to find one that fits your filmmaking requirement. Alternatively, you may look for reviews on the Internet to know what’s hot and what’s not in the electronic market. The second-hand market would be your best bet if you were looking for a camera with advanced features, but at affordable prices. The best part is that prices of electronic goods depreciate all the time, so it makes sense to wait for a while to buy that latest camera you have set your eyes on. Many a filmmakers are content using S-VHS and Hi8 that come with a decent price tag, stereo sound and impeccable quality. There’s no harm in experimenting, so try renting cameras that you are tempted to buy and see for yourself if they are actually worth buying. 

A 3-CCD DV camcorder such as the Canon XL-2 or Sony VX-2100 is the first choice of many filmmakers for their superior picture quality, sharpness, and optimum color. Other options include the latest 1-CCD models, such as the Canon Elura or Optura Xi that offer excellent image quality and are not too heavy on the pocket. Look for cameras that offer cool features such as manual white balance (ideal for tricky lighting situations), manual focus, and exposure control. Choosing a camera greatly depends on the kind of film you intend to shoot.
Other equipment For excellent filmmaking, just having a top-notch camera is not enough. You need to also buy accessories such as a tripod. It is advisable to have a tripod with a fluid head that facilitates smooth panning and hence better image quality. Manfrotto-Bogen is known for making some of the finest low-budget tripods that are very sturdy and rated high in performance. You also need to invest in an external microphone for better sound quality. In situations where the subject is far from the camera, the built-in microphone is not enough and having a lavalier microphone or shotgun microphone works better. Also recommended is a wide-angle accessory lens that is useful if you have to work within a confinement, while an on-camera video light would be perfect for low-light filming situations. And don’t forget to carry extra batteries and videotapes just in case you need them. 
Filmmaking tips Most of us are acquainted with using still cameras and video cameras aren’t much different. Great filmmaking comes from the ability to use a camera effectively and this is possible only when you understand what a video camera can do for you. A video camera comes with advanced in-built features making it difficult for beginners to use them. Read the manual carefully to figure out the many ways in which your camera can help you before you start using it. Once you start filming, it makes no sense to stop it halfway through and wonder what to do next only because you never bothered to read the manual carefully. 

Now that you have the skills to use your camera to its full potential and have the necessary equipment in place, you can finally move on to actual filming. Until you get the hang of it, let the automatic mode be on so that you don’t have to manually control focus, exposure, or white balance. The way you hold your camera is very important, as most hobbyists end up recording a hazy video clip simply because they don’t know how to handle the function. In the initial stages of filmmaking, avoid the zooming and panning tasks and instead, compose a picture in the viewfinder by holding it steady. Hold the shot for at least ten seconds and before the action is complete, you need to start thinking about your next shot. For close-ups, adjust the lens at its widest setting and walk closer to the subject before you compose the shot. For best results, you need to shoot a variety of shots at varying focal lengths or else the film produced will be difficult to edit. A wide view of the scene followed by other shots of medium and close-up range is the right sequence for beginners to follow while pursuing filmmaking. You can shoot interesting clips by shifting your position and changing angles occasionally. 

If you are depending on the built-in microphone for capturing sound, make sure that you are close to the person who is talking. It is also important to hold the camera steady until the dialogue is delivered to rule out the possibility of sound drop-outs or inconsistency. 

Filming a project is not enough until you give the finishing touches by editing it. Thanks to the computer and efficient products such as G5 and iMac easily accessible today, editing is neither expensive nor difficult. Filmmakers can also indulge in the iMac computer that has integrated iMovie editing software that makes editing extremely easy. With just a few hours of practice, you can log and edit a tape in no time making it ready for viewing. 

While making the first film, most students commit the mistake of making a long film. Camera movement has to be smooth and unobtrusive and complex moves must be saved for the last. Filmmaking success lies in the proper synchronization of all elements such as camera, music and acting. If you think filmmaking is your forte, it’s about time you took it more seriously and consider formal training from an accredited film school. Most people who are inclined to take up filmmaking as a hobby are often students specializing in subjects like psychology, drama, or English literature. Filmmaking is a competitive but rewarding career. So, if you are serious about making it a career, waste no time further and get into a film school that can educate you about all aspects of film making. 

To give your filmmaking venture a more professional look, make sure that you work with an experienced crew. Producing a good film is all about proper planning and preparation.

Line Dancing,"Line Dancing Information  What Is Line Dancing? Let`s cha cha! No matter which way you turn, line dancing continues to pop up in different venues around the world. You`ll find line dancing on the dance floors of birthday parties, school dances, social functions, and clubs. Anywhere you can find a gathering of people in the mood to dance, you will no doubt run across a choreographed line dance of some sort. 

Line dancing is for everyone. Your age, fitness level, and dancing ability are all irrelevant. Nobody cares who you are or how well you dance. All that matters is that you have a great time learning new dances. Who knows, you might choreograph your own sensational line dance. 

Not only is line dancing an entertaining activity, it gives you the opportunity to meet people in a fun and relaxed environment. No stuffy dinner parties with this crowd! Instead, look forward to meeting a unique group of people who all share a passion for this intriguing type of dance. 

A line dance is choreographed dance related to country music with a repeated sequence of steps in which a group of people dance in one or more lines or rows without regard for the gender of the individuals, all facing the same direction, and executing the steps at the same time. 

The exercise aspect alone is enough to encourage even the least coordinated individual to get out on the dance floor and learn some moves. 

Regardless of your music taste or athletic ability, line dancing has something to offer. Line dancing is a fascinating combination of exercise, choreography, socialization, and entertaining music. Every dance is different and every dance group has their own steps. 

Line dancing is not just country anymore. From classic folk moves to the latest hip-hop grooves, line dancing will have you hooked on dance for years to come. 
Learn To Line Dance Line dancing is not difficult to learn. Plus, the line dancing community around the world is friendly and almost everyone is willing to help out a beginner. There are three important parts to learning to line dance:   1. Practice. Practice. Practice. 

2. Put Yourself Out There 

3. Have Fun! 

Practice 

You can learn to line dance for free online. Many sites offer a combination of lesson types. These lessons include:   • Text classes: Each class begins with a brief description of the line dance and the music to be played. The rest of the lesson is a step by step instruction sheet for each dance. These lessons can be viewed online or printed for your reading convenience. 

• Video classes: These classes are videos of an instructor or a group performing a specific line dance. The lesson might be broken down into individual steps or the whole dance might be performed at once. 

The best part about free online classes is that you can repeat each class until you are comfortable with each set of steps. 

Dance classes are also an excellent way to learn to line dance. Your dance instructors and classmates share your interest in this style of dance. In general, line dance classmates tend to become friends. Many who learn together will attend line dancing events together. 

Adult dance classes are far less costly than child and teen dance lessons. In addition to the low cost of classes, many dance schools offer open classes. You can attend as often as you wish and you can pay for the days you attend rather than a full block of lessons. 

Note: At the end of this guide, you will find a list of popular line dances. If you are having difficulty finding videos of line dances, this list will help. A simple search will provide links to typed descriptions and a myriad of videos.  
Put Yourself Out There Once you`ve mastered some of the basic steps and dances, get yourself out the door and head to a line dancing event. This is a chance to put what you learned to use. You will also learn new steps for dances not found in the classes you took. 

If you took all of your classes online, now might be a great time to sign up for a dance class. Not only will you meet other dancers, your instructor will be able to point you in the direction of venues that feature line dancing. 

Line dancing is great for singles and couples alike. If you are single, get on the dance floor and have fun. Most line dances do not require partners. If you do need a partner, this is a great chance for you to meet some great people. 

Dancing in public also gives you the opportunity to correct your steps. If you misinterpreted a step or your choreography is off, watching other line dancers perform is a great opportunity for you to improve your line dancing skills. 

Have Fun! 

Line dancing is not a chore. The steps are fun and varied. Everyone else will be enjoying themselves immensely. So, get yourself out on that dance floor and have a great time enjoying your new line dancing hobby. 
Line Dancing Structure As you begin to learn to line dance, you will discover that the structure of line dancing is simple. The basic steps are easy to learn and the rhythm is normally simple to follow. Even complex steps stem from the basic line dancing steps. 

There are two key components to every line dance: 

• The direction the dancers are facing during the dance. 

• The basic steps used during each dance. 

After that, there is little that transfers from dance to dance. Steps are modified all the time. A club or an event might have a signature move. A particular song might have its own special step. Anything is possible. If you come up with a fun new step or a variation of an old favorite, try it out. Who knows, it might catch on!  
Wall Each dance is said to consist of a number of walls. A wall is the direction in which the dancers face at any given time: the front (the direction faced at the beginning of the dance), the back or one of the sides. 

• In a one-wall dance, the dancers face the same direction at the end of the sequence as at the beginning. 

• In a two-wall dance, repetitions of the sequence end alternately at the back and front walls. In other words, the dancers have effectively turned through 180 degrees during one set. The samba line dance is an example of a two-wall dance. While doing the ""volte"" step, the dancers turn 180 degrees to face a new wall. 

• In a four-wall dance, the direction faced at the end of the sequence is 90 degrees to the right or left from the direction in which they faced at the beginning. As a result, the dancers face each of the four walls in turn at the end of four consecutive repetitions of the sequence, before returning to the original wall. The hustle line dance is an example of a four-wall dance because in the final figure they turn 90 degrees to the left to face a new wall. In some dances, they turn 270 degrees, a ""three-quarter turn,"" to face the new wall.  
Step descriptions Descriptions of some dance steps in their typical form are below. They are subject to variations in particular dances, where a stomp or a point may occur instead of a touch, for example, in the grapevine. 

Some songs will indicate the moves required for the dance. For example, the song might instruct you to “Hop 3 Times” or “Slide to the Left.” Follow the instructions, paying special attention to the number of steps indicated. 

Line dancing steps involve primarily leg and feet movements. However, some dances do involve clapping or other arm movements. 

• Chasse: One foot moves to the side, the other foot is placed next to it, and the first foot moves again to the side. 

• Grapevine: One foot moves to the side, the other moves behind it, the first foot moves again to the side, and the second touches next to the first. There are variations: the final step can consist of a hitch, a scuff, placement of weight on the second foot, and so forth. The name of the step is sometimes abbreviated to vine. 

• Weave: To the left or the right. This is a grapevine with a cross in front as well as a cross behind. Creates a slight zig zag pattern on the floor. 

• Hitch: Raise your knee straight up so that your upper leg is parallel to the floor. Your lower leg will be bent at a 90 degree angle. 

• Criss Cross: Begin with your feet apart. Jump up and land with your legs crossed. Jump up and land with your legs uncrossed. Bring your feet together. 

• Cha Cha: Bring your right foot in front of your left foot. Move your left foot back. Move your right foot to the right. Bring your left foot forward. 

• Triple step: This is 3 steps being taken in only 2 beats of music. Can move forward, backward, left, right or on the spot. 

• Shuffle step: A triple step to the front or the back, left or right side, starting on either foot. The feet slide rather than being given the staccato (short and sharp) movement of the cha-cha. There is a slight difference in the interpretation of the timing to give the element its distinctive look. It is counted as 1 & 2, 3 & 4, etc. However, the actual amount of time devoted to each of the 3 steps in the shuffle is 3/4 of a beat, 1/4 of a beat, then one full beat of music. 

• Lock step: A triple step backwards or forwards, starting on either foot, with the second foot slid up to and tightly locked in front of or behind the first foot before the first foot is moved a second time in the same direction as for the first step. 

Other steps include applejack, botafogo, butterfly, coaster step, heel grind, jazz box, kick ball change, kick ball step, lunge, mambo step, military turn, Monterey turn, paddle, pivot turn, rock step, sailor step, scissor step, scuff, spiral turn, stamp, stomp, sugarfoot, swivel and vaudeville.  
The Count The count is not necessarily the rhythm of the music. It is the movement of each line of dancers. Many line dances limit steps to one per beat. Others are more complex and use faster steps to take advantage of half, quarter, and eighth counts. 
Clothing & Shoes People buy ridiculous workout outfits every day. Department stores have whole departments dedicated to neon colored spandex. Those days are over. In fact, the line dancing wardrobe is simply and highly affordable. Your line dancing wardrobe should be, in one word, COMFORTABLE.  
Your Clothing You will be moving constantly so plan to get warm. Layers are a good choice when getting dressed to line dance. 

As you won`t be tumbling or flying through the air during your line dancing adventures, you can wear almost anything you choose. Skirts and dresses are popular. Both shorts and pants are also appropriate. As a general rule, lightweight, breathable fabrics like cotton are perfect for any line dancing activity. 

Unless you are attending a costume or theme party, dress tastefully. Clothing that does not fit or reveals too much is distracting to other dancers.  
Your Shoes Shoes are far more important to line dancing than clothing. 

When you look for a pair of shoes, keep these features in mind: 

• Adjustable straps or laces – feet swell during physical activity. 

• Stable heels – wide bases or thick heels offer more support and stability than stilettos. 

• Support – arch and ankle support if you need either. 

Great shoes for line dancing include: 

• Tennis shoes & sneakers 

• Cowboy boots 

• Sandals with straps. 
Line Dancing Etiquette & Safety Start your line dancing hobby off on the right foot. These line dancing etiquette tips will help you earn points on the dance floor. As you gain experience and move beyond the beginner stage, don`t forget to follow the same rules.  
The Dance Floor Is For Dancing • If you have to talk, leave the floor. Stay out of the way of people who are dancing. 

• Do not bring anything on the dance floor. Drinks, food, and bags are never okay on the dance floor. 

• If you need to get to the other side of the room, walk around the dance floor.  
Pay Attention • The outside lane of the dance floor is for couples. They have the right of way on the dance floor. 

• Dance the right dance. Do not change the dance mid song. 

• Adjust your step size to the size of the crowd. 

• If you bump into someone, apologize regardless of who was at fault.  
Help Out The Rookies • Be nice to beginners. Gently nudge them in the right direction as necessary. 

• Be helpful but do not hold up the dance floor to teach someone a step.  
Stay Safe Line dancing is a pretty accident free activity. 

• If you plan to dance for hours on end, some simple stretching prior to dancing will help prevent injuries. 

• Stay hydrated while dancing. 

If you travel to line dancing classes or events alone, take all necessary precautions. 

• Do not accept rides from strangers after class or an event. 

• If you feel uncomfortable at any point, do not hesitate to ask for assistance. 

• Always let someone know the location of the event, how long the event will last, and when you expect to return home.",
Astronomy,"Astronomy Information  Overview Amateur astronomy, also called backyard astronomy, is a hobby whose participants enjoy watching the night sky (as well as the day sky too, for sunspots, eclipses, and other objects.), and the many of objects found in it, mainly with portable telescopes and binoculars. While scientific research is not their main goal, most amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring stars, asteroids and discovering comets. Such efforts are one of the relatively few ways interested amateurs can still make useful contributions to scientific knowledge. 
Telescopes Most amateur astronomers will choose from the three most common types of entry-level telescopes; the refractor, the reflector, and the catadioptric.  
Refractor telescopes Refractor telescopes are a type of optical telescope that uses a lens as its objective to form an image (also referred to a dioptric telescope). The refracting telescope design was originally used in spy glasses and astronomical telescopes but is also used for long telephoto camera lenses. It is the earliest type of telescope, and although they are still available today and are an economical choice, they are often low power and are larger than other types of telescopes. Most amateur astronomers are looking for more power in a smaller telescope.  
Reflector telescopes A reflecting telescope (also called a reflector) is an optical telescope which uses a single or combination of curved mirrors that reflect light and form an image. The reflecting telescope was invented in the 17th century as an alternative to the refracting telescope which, at that time, was a design that suffered from severe chromatic aberration. Although reflecting telescopes produce other types of optical aberrations, it is a design that allows for very large diameter objectives. Almost all of the major telescopes used in astronomy research are reflectors. Reflecting telescopes come in many design variations and may employ extra optical elements to improve image quality or place the image in a mechanically advantageous position. There are many different types of reflector telescopes, including Newtonian ( a simple design popular with home telescope builders) and the Cassegrain (compact but less powerful).  
Catadioptric telescopes The catadioptric telescope is actually a type of reflector telescope, but which combine specifically shaped mirrors and lenses in designs that have all spherical surfaces that are easier to manufacture, have an overall greater degree of error correction than their all lens or mirror counterparts, have a wide field of view, take advantage of a folded optical path, or a combination of any or all of these attributes. Many types employ “correctors”, a lens or curved mirror in a combined image-forming optical system so that the reflective or refractive element can correct the aberrations produced by its counterpart, the basic reflector telescope. 

‘Schmidt-Cassegrain’ telescopes are one of the most popular commercial designs on the amateur astronomical market, having been mass-produced since the 1960’s. The design replaces the Schmidt Camera film holder with a Cassegrain secondary mirror making a folded optical path with a long focal length and a narrow field of view. This makes for a compact telescope with the clarity of a refractor telescope but the power of a Newtonian reflector.  
GoTo Telescopes GOTO telescopes have become more popular since the 1980s as technology has improved and prices have been reduced. With these computer-driven telescopes, the user typically enters the name of the item of interest and the mechanics of the telescope point the telescope towards that item automatically. They have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on research. For example, GOTO telescopes tend to be faster for locating items of interest than star hopping, allowing more time for studying of the object. GOTO also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth telescope mounts, allowing them to produce an overall less expensive product.",
Palm Reading,"Palm Reading Information Intro If you’ve always been intuitive and sensitive about people, palm reading or chiromancy could be a satisfying hobby for you. Actually to learn palm reading, you don’t necessarily have to be psychic, since palm reading is not about predicting the future based on the lines on someone’s palm. Palm reading is mainly about understanding about a person and interpreting the various lines, fingerprints, the mounts that are on the hand. So if you happen to be interested in palm reading, you’ll be pleased to know that you can learn how to do it, and with practice, can probably convert your hobby into a remunerative activity or take it up as a full-time career. You can become a successful palm reader and also start a center where you offer palm reading and hand analysis. 
While many people tend to think that palm readers are fakes, not all of them are. With any profession that seems mystical and has to do with fortune telling, a lot of people cash in with a little knowledge. You can certainly become a palm reader with credibility by learning the right basics.  Getting Started With Palm Reading Palm reading is an ancient art that has been practiced all over the world. Several references exist in various religious books like the Vedas and the Bible. If you go back in history, you will find even eminent personalities like Julius Caesar, Aristotle, etc. were connected with palmistry. Kings had palm readers in their courts and believed in them. 
There are several guides, books, and online courses that will help you with the basics of this ‘art’. These teach you about what intuition is all about and how you can use it in palm reading. Usually, both hands must be studied during palm reading. When you learn about palm reading, you will learn about different hand textures, types of hands, color of palm and how to interpret it and the characteristics of the lines on the palm. You will also get to know about the specific hand marks to look for and understand, about the fingers, the thumbs and the nails. The palm of the hand has various ‘mounts’ that mean different things about a person and you will learn how to interpret these as well. You will know what the rings worn by a person can mean and how the signs on a person’s fingers can even be used in criminology, revealing the person’s individuality.  The Different Facets Of Palmistry We usually hear of palm reading – but palmistry comprises of chiromancy, chirognomy and dermatoglyphics. The three are together called chirology. Chiromancy has to do with palm reading in terms of interpreting what the lines mean. Chirognomy, which has its origins in France around the 18th century, classifies hands according to their shape and size. People that had the same shape/size of hands were found to have similar characteristics. So today, over time, palm reading does not just mean looking at and understanding the lines on the palm; it also has to do with length of fingers, nails, texture of skin, flexibility of fingers and other characteristics. Dermatoglyphics deals with the lines and pattern of the skin on the hands and feet in connection to our genetics. In fact, it is believed that skin ridges are useful in detecting chromosomal abnormalities and genetic diseases like diabetes, cardiac problems schizophrenia, Down’s syndrome etc.  Why Palm Reading? Apart from the fun part when you can be the palm reader holding people spellbound in a party by your intuitiveness, you will find that different people go to a palm reader for different purposes. It could be that they want to understand themselves, and know about health problems based on the reading. Since there are so many aspects of palm reading, there is a pretty good possibility that people will find what they seek. Through palm reading, you can make an assessment of a person’s emotional tendencies, attitudes, fears and strengths through the lines and marks on the hand. 
There are palm readers who have converted their hobby into an income-earner. Professional palm readers can earn anything from 20 to 100 US$ an hour, based on how well known they are and the number of referrals they get. As they become more and more popular, and start catering to film stars, politicians and other famous people, the sky is the limit. 
Palmistry has caught on all over the world. In real-life applications, criminal investigations use fingerprinting for identifying individuals. By studying skin patterns medical researchers say that there is a link between genetic abnormalities and certain marks on the hand. Also some fingerprint patterns are related to heart disease. So it is not hard to see why palmistry is a subject worth studying – both for recreation and for those who are serious about it.  Color, Shape, Texture & Flexibility In palm reading, it is not just the lines that are read – due importance is also given to the color, shape, texture and flexibility of the hand. Let’s take a look at each of these in turn.  
Color Ever notice how a doctor checks your palms? White hands mean a lack of blood circulation. Pink hands generally indicate good health. People with red hands could probably be suffering from high blood pressure. Some people have bluish hands, which shows inadequate blood circulation. Ideally, the hand must be pinkish.  
Shape How is the shape and formation of the hands? Let’s look at the most common shapes: • A square hand – practical, focused on success • Tapering hand – artistic, enthusiastic, sensitive • Spade hand – energetic, positively inclined • Pointed hand – idealistic, impractical • Long hand – with knotty joints, thinker, philosopher 
We often come across mixed hands, so you’ll be able to see the characteristics of those features. Texture How does the hand feel to the touch? Is it hard, rough or soft? Usually, those with soft hands are said to be sensitive and refined. Rough hands could mean tough people who enjoy being active with rugged activities.  

Flexibility Flexible hands mean a reasonable nature. Very pliable hands mean unconventional and broadminded. People with inflexible hands are usually stubborn. Also look at the thumbs and fingers. Sometimes the thumb is set low forming a wide angle with the hand – these people tend to be careless. If the thumb is set high, it means a careful determined type.  Which Hand? You have probably wondered about what the difference is between reading the right hand and the left hand. People who are right handed are more logical and left-handed people are more creative. Palm readers consider the fact that the left hand is connected to the right side of the brain and the right hand is connected to the left side of the brain. The left brain/right hand features logic, attention to detail, facts and realism. The right brain/left hand person shows intuitiveness and risk taking ability. Therefore, the palmist looks at both hands since they reveal two different aspects.  Length Of Fingers – How Is It Interpreted? For a palm reader, the length of the fingers indicates information about the individual’s character. Here’s a synopsis: • Long fingers - analytical, academic, likes attention to detail • Short fingers - practical, intuitive, and instinctive • Proportionate hands - balanced personality 
Now lets look at each finger of the hand and what it shows: • Forefinger – ambition, self-confidence, self-esteem • Middle finger – discipline, balance • Ring finger - originality, imagination • Little finger – communication 
Let us interpret different situations taking these fingers in relation to each other. - Forefinger is in line with the bottom of the middle fingers nail means a balanced ego. - Ring finger is in line with the bottom of the middle finger’s nail, means emotional balance. - Forefinger is higher than the bottom part of the middle finger’s nail shows self-assurance. Ring finger above the bottom part of the middle finger’s nail shows highly emotional and impulsive person. - Middle finger standing out noticeably from the rest shows a serious nature. Little finger standing apart from the rest of the hand, means a bold, outspoken and self-sufficient person. Apart from the above, in palm reading, the thumb, the nails and the fingerprints are significant. So you would need to know how to make a palm print.  How To Take A Palm Print You will need the following: • Black water-soluble printing ink • A rubber roller • Good quality paper • A tile on which to spread the ink • A towel Spread some ink evenly on the tile with the rubber roller. Now, spread the inky rubber roller on the hand to cover the palm the fingers and part of your wrist. Place the paper on the towel and gently press our hand down in its most natural position without shaking. The towel will cushion your hand on the paper. Very carefully, directly lift your hand off the paper without smudging any line. Your palm print is ready.  Lines On The Palm And Their Meaning Interestingly, the number of lines varies from hand to hand. While some people have lots of lines, some people have just a few. Men have fewer lines than women. The four prominent lines you will see on a hand are:

• Life line
• Head line  • Heart line • Fate line   The life line is the line around the thumb and indicates physical health. A strong line means good health. A faint life line would mean the opposite. However, just the head line in isolation will not give a true picture. So please note that each line must be read in conjunction with the others to make a complete palm reading. The life line also shows major events in the person’s life. If there is a line branching off from the top of the life line towards the forefinger, it shows ambition. If there’s a line branching off from the bottom of the life line towards the wrist, it indicates travel. 
The Head line begins from a point similar to the lifeline near the thumb, and goes across the palm. It indicates thought process. Let’s see what different types of head lines:
 • Clear – mental focus, strength
 • Straight – logic and pragmatism
 • Curved – flexible, balance between creativity and logic
 • Steeply curved – high imagination
 • Short and stops short of the middle finger - focus, but closed-minded
 • Fork at the end of the headline under the ring finger - flexible
 • Fork is under the little finger - aptitude for business or science
 
The Heart line indicates emotions and relationships, begins from the edge of the hand under the little finger, and extends toward the top of the palm. If it:
 • •Ends between the forefinger and middle finger - emotion and passion • •Ends under the middle finger - selfish • •Goes right across the top of the hand - interest in more of a mental relationship rather than emotion. • •Is short and up to the middle finger –cool, interested in physical side • •Ends in a fork - mentally and physically balanced 
The Fate line runs up from the base of the palm and ends usually below the middle finger. It is also called the Saturn Line, or the Line of Destiny. It can be fragmented, overlapping, or broken. It shows your direction in life. 
Palm readers also look at other lines and marks on the palm like the ring of Solomon around the forefinger, the girdle of Venus above the heart line, bracelet lines on the wrist, relationship lines under the little finger the fate line from the wrist to the middle finger, the sun line from the wrist to the ring finger and so on. As we said earlier, all the lines are read to produce a complete reading. 
 In summary… You can get proficient at palm reading by taking a look at the books, instructional videos and links at the following website to give you an even more in-depth and intricate knowledge of the art of palm reading. The more palms you read, the more experience you get when you compare and learn. You develop the aptitude to know at a glance, what is unusual about the hand. Combine a good number of strangers’ hands to improve your palm reading skills. Palm reading is a captivating hobby that lets you read the character and destiny by observing the hand. The palm is practically a blueprint of our life and by knowing how to read it you can actually influence the destiny of the person whose palm you read.",
Board Games,"Board Games Information  Introduction Mention the term board games to a number of people in our modern technological age, and you will likely be met with snickering, laughter, or raised brows. With video game technology having developed to the point where the graphics and images are so real and lifelike, it is difficult for many younger generations to understand the appeal of board games. Yet board games have existed for thousands of years. 

A board game is defined as “a game in which counters or pieces are placed, removed, or moved on a premarked surface or ‘board’ according to a set of rules (Wikipedia).” Board games require a measure of strategy, planning, and plotting for the most part, and can also require a measure of luck as well. Some games that immediately come to mind with regard to luck for many people might be Yahtzee or Monopoly, two very popular board games through the years. However, both of these games require strategy and thinking to be successful. 

The two most enduring and popular board games in history are chess and checkers. These games have been played by people in poverty and by kings and queens. Their appeal is largely based on the intense strategy and planning required to be successful. Board games teach children and adults valuable lessons about life, relationships, and competition. 

The stigma that board games have gained in more recent years is nothing new, however, though the polarization of television and video games have pushed their importance aside for many people. Yet what board games can do for families by bringing them together (as well as for friendships) cannot be overstated or underestimated. An hour or two a week playing board games with loved ones can help people connect and talk with one another in ways that would not be possible by sitting in front of the television together. 

Board games are also great at teaching some valuable life lessons. At the core, though, board games are fun and exciting to play. If you have never played a board game or haven’t done so in many years, there is a world of amazing enjoyment just waiting to be discovered. 
Collecting While there is not a vast commercial market for collecting board games, the appeal for collecting them can be strong for a number of people. Older generations will likely look back on their youth and fondly recall playing board games with their family members and friends. These memories can even be quite strong and stirring as they think about loved ones who have passed on from this life, smiling and laughing as they played a board game together. 

Finding the games that they used to play, if they are no longer in production, can be a great testament to the days of their youth, much like collecting pictures and trinkets and trophies from those days. 

For others, the idea of collecting some of these games can appeal for posterity or even profit. The first edition of Monopoly or Scrabble, for example, could be worth a great deal of money, especially if one can find them in great condition. These two games happen to also be interesting artifacts of history since neither one of them were sold on their first attempts to the companies that eventually marketed them. The creators of these two games had been turned away more than once because the company executives didn’t believe that there would be any interest in them. 

So those first editions can fetch a fair penny. It is important to note, however, that collecting board games is not like collecting baseball cards or comics and as such, if the intent is to make money through this effort, the prospects will be long and thin. Collecting board games is more suited and ideal for the individual who has a vested interest in them, whether personal or otherwise. 
Luck Versus Strategy Board games vary across the board (pardon the pun) when it comes to the amount of strategy or luck needed. Board games such as chess, for example, is almost completely reliant on strategy. The successful chess player will be able to map out and plan several moves ahead every time, estimating and predicting what his or her opponent will do on their next few turns in order to set up the pieces in the right order for the win. A game like Yahtzee, on the other hand, is based on dice alone. The player will rely on some elements of luck on every roll, but they can also use strategy to some degree to determine their scoring, removing the least likely roll sequences in the future and hoping to get the right roll on their next turn. 

Most board games, however, are a combination of some luck and strategy. What has kept board games popular through the years is the need to rely on some level of strategy, advanced thinking and problem solving, and the ability for anyone to actually win any given game. Yes, there are those players of these games who are so advanced that they will not likely lose to amateurs, but every time a person sits down to play a board game, they actually have a chance to win. This is what separates board games from physical competitions. 

Games of luck can be quite enjoyable for less intensive games and those of strategy can help teach children and adults the power of advanced and forward thinking. Chess happens to be one of the most popular games in history because it teaches players about advanced strategy and planning and many of the principles that are taught during chess are applied on the battlefield, in the corporate office, and even in relationships. 
Where Board Games are Appropriate Unless a company designs video games, there are likely very few appropriate times where playing these types of games at work are acceptable. Yet board games can actually teach employees the power of teamwork and that strategy can often trump education or raw skills. 

Board games are also a great tool to use during school for children of any age. For the same principles that make board games a positive experience among working adults, children, from kindergarten to high school, can learn to play within the confines of fixed rules as well as how to work together to accomplish a goal. 

For families, board games have almost become a lost device to bring the family members together. Television and modern video games have created an atmosphere of escapism, and even when families are sitting together in the same room watching television, they are not interacting, which they would be doing if they were playing board games. For parents, board games can teach their children invaluable lessons about how to play properly with others, how to plan for the future, and how to strategize their moves. Even the most basic children’s games, such as Chutes and Ladders, though it may appear to be based on luck alone, requires some thinking at times to determine the path that they want to move in. 

One of the great aspects to board games is that they can be played anytime, anywhere. Taken on vacations or camping in the woods, board games don’t require batteries or power and are usually quite compact and can fit into a suitcase without much trouble. There are literally hundreds of different board games that are being manufactured every year, so there is a plethora of choices when it comes to which ones to play. 

The most popular games throughout the years are popular for a reason. If you are wondering which ones will suit your family or friends best, figure out how much time you would like to devote to the games every week and then determine which game or games can be completed in that amount of time. You will soon discover an amazing world of possibility when you start playing board games with your friends, family, or coworkers. 
Frequently Asked Questions I used to love to play board games as a child. Wouldn’t it be considered odd for me to start playing again at my age? The great thing about board games is that they are ideal for any age. The stigma that board games have received in recent years derives from a lack of imagination built through the age of video games. Yet most modern video games are designed to be one player only, whereas board games demand two or more, making it a social activity which is always a positive influence on life.   I can’t remember this game I used to play as a kid. How can I go about finding it again? There are a number of resources online that you can use to track down the game that you fondly recall from your youth. The problem that you may run into, however, is if you can’t describe it effectively. The best strategy would be to find a discussion group whose passion is board games, ask for help, and describe the game as best you can. Odds are if you played it once and it was a store-bought game, then somebody else will know what it was called and how you can find a version to purchase.   I’m told that family time is beneficial, especially for young children. Isn’t watching television shows good enough? Why should I consider playing board games? The advantage that board games offer the modern family is not only being close to one another, but it teaches about rules as well as developing certain strategies to defeat the opponent. Children benefit from playing board games with the family because it helps their brains to mature and strengthen while learning how to win, and lose, graciously in a calm and comforting and warm environment. The only thing that television teaches families is how to turn off their brains and be in the same room together.   Are there strategy books for board games that I can use to help learn the game? In this day and age, there is a book for just about everything and if there isn’t a book, there are likely resources that you can find online to learn about the games you want to play. For chess, for example, there are hundreds of books on learning the game and improving your skills at it. There are also electronic versions of some board games that can also teach the rules and best strategies as you play them. 
Conclusion Board games have been around for thousands of years. While the format for different games have changed over time, and others have been lost to history, they are still an integral part of many lives around the world. Board games have the ability to bring families and friends together, to make people think, plan, and learn to strategize, and to create a sense of fair and fun competition among a number of different people. 

Throughout the twentieth century, board games became a major industry in consumerism, with some of the most famous and indelible games being created and being played to this day. In fact, some of the most famous and by far the most popular games that are currently being played, some of them were turned down by many company executives because they didn’t believe that the consumers would have much interest in them. Yet, for something that has been around for as many years as board games have existed, it is amazing to think that their popularity could wane. Which they haven’t. 

While there are certainly factions of people who dismiss board games as being uninspiring, chess and checkers remain two of the most popular board games in history that have entertained paupers and kings alike through the ages. Getting into board games is easy, as is collecting them. There are treasures of forgotten games around the world and icons that remain popular to this day. 

For a different kind of entertainment, board games will certainly inspire rivalry, fun, and excitement for any age.",
Spirits-Liquor Tasting,"Spirits-Liquor Tasting Information  Introduction Spirit-tasting is the sensory examination and evaluation of spirits and liquors. Whether making winner cocktails with unique ingredients and some smooth twists or mixing other drinks with these spirits, understanding the basics on how spirits mix and blend is a must. Being a good spirit-taster has some good benefits, from leading to happier and more satisfied people to increased profit sales due to numerous orders. Success in this area lies on properly and distinctly tasting these spirits. 

Liquor tasting is a bit different than wine tasting. However, the purpose is the same: finding the flavor you like best. When doing a taste test, the following things are being looked for in liquor: aroma, taste, color, and how it feels on the tongue (the aftertaste). Spirit tasting is a bit subjective, since it varies from person to person. 

A distilled beverage, liquor, or spirit is a drinkable liquid containing ethanol that is produced by distilling fermented grain, fruit, or vegetables. This excludes undistilled fermented beverages such as beer, wine, and hard cider. The term hard liquor is often used in the United States to distinguish distilled beverages from undistilled ones. 
What to Check
Color Color depicts the purity and age of a spirit. When the spirit is clear, it is regarded as being pure. When the spirit’s depth is lighter, it is young, whereas when it is darker, it is old.  
Aroma Most of the taste sensations come from the nose. If you don’t believe on this, try pouring a small amount of Scotch whisky into your mouth while holding your nose. You may taste it as being salty and sweet, but until that only. When smelling, let the alcohol go past your smell and identify the aromas that associate with it. Naming them might be difficult at first, but as you grow your flavour distinctions, it becomes easier. The most common scents are fruits, flowers, spices, and herbs. Master the flavours and aromas found on them. Know the differences between a cocoa and a chocolate, different fruits (citrus or berries), various spices (nutmeg, cinnamon), and assorted herbs (oregano, thyme). When you encounter a scent that you don’t know, check and discover its origin.  
Taste Taste is the easiest part in checking out the spirit, but don’t just taste it. Look for the aftertaste (also known as the finish). The finish can tell you more about the quality of the spirit. Look out for balance. 
How to Become a Spirit-Taster Becoming a spirit-taster can be a difficult process because you need to recognize each aroma, taste, finish, and color to be able to determine the quality of a spirit or liquor. Becoming a connoisseur, however, is a fulfilling one. Not only do you gain more information about the liquor, you also gain status as one of the respected people in the wine and spirit industry because of your expertise. 

The first step in spirit tasting is to check the color of the spirit. Is it clear, cloudy, or murky? 

The second step in spirit tasting is to smell it. You may swirl it slightly, but wait for a moment before lowering your nose slowly. Swirling also brings out the alcohol from the spirit. As you sniff the spirit, pick out the aromas. Note each aroma and try to check for distinct smells, as each spirit has its unique smell. 

The third and most exciting step in spirit tasting is to actually taste it. Pour about an ounce of the spirit into your mouth and observe as it moves around your tongue. Breathe in a bit of air through your clenched teeth. Identify the origin of the spirit (Fruits? Grains?). When you have determined it, spit it out, and then re-taste it. 

Finally, check the finish. Is it long-lasting or goes out easily? Is it rich or weak? Even though aged spirits last long, it should be always clean. 

It is best to have several liquors and spirits available for spirit tasting. This is to be able to make a distinction on several liquors and spirits and be able to familiarize with the flavours and aromas associated with them. 
Different Types of Spirits Distilled liquors are the base ingredients for the majority of cocktails. Knowing and understanding these differences between various liquors gives us an idea to come up with different combinations of drinks. Each person’s taste is different than others; hence, spirit-tasting is subjective. Found below are examples of liquor that we can try and let our taste be our judge. 
Brandy Brandy (from brandywine, derived from Dutch brandewijn—""burnt wine"") is a spirit produced by distilling wine, the wine having first been produced by fermenting grapes. Brandy generally contains 35%–60% alcohol by volume and is typically taken as an after-dinner drink. 

In general, there are three types of brandy: Grape brandy is one of the great and best known types of brandy because it is produced from grape juice, is placed in a wooden cask, and is tested by time. The second type of brandy is called a pomace. It is derived from grape seeds, skin, pulp and stem. Pomace is an outcome of fermentation and distillation. Finally, there is the Fruit brandy, which is produced from other fruits which contain pure liquid such as apricots, cherries, apples and peaches. 

Brandy Labels: Brandy has a rating system to describe its quality and condition, these indicators can usually be found near the brand name on the label. 

• A.C.- aged 2 years in wood. • V.S.- ""Very Special"" or 3-Star, aged at least 3 years in wood. • V.S.O.P.- ""Very Superior Old Pale"" or 5-Star, aged at least 5 years in wood. • X.O.- ""Extra Old"", Napoleon or Vieille Reserve, aged at least 6 years, Napoleon at least 4 years. • Vintage- Stored in the cask until the time it is bottled with the label showing the vintage date. • Hors D`age: These are too old to determine the age. 
Gin Gin is a spirit whose predominant flavor is derived from juniper berries (Juniperus communis). Although several different styles of gin have existed since its origins, gin is broadly differentiated into two basic legal categories. Distilled gin is crafted in the traditional manner, by re-distilling neutral spirit of agricultural origin with juniper berries and other botanicals. Compound gin is made by simply flavoring neutral spirit with essences and/or other `natural flavorings` without re-distillation, and is not as highly regarded. 

To check for the appearance of the gin, hold the glass up to the light and check on the liquid’s color. There might be hints of various hues, as the natural ingredients tend to impart color as well as flavor. In nosing the gin, a simple sniff can tell you whether it is good to sip it. Good gin should show at least some juniper and smell soft and subtle. If a strong chemical was revealed, swirl the drink to release the flavors and smell the gin again. To taste the gin, gently sip it and have it roll around the mouth before you swallow. When you get used to the taste, you will notice an array of flavors from the botanicals. The result should be smooth and creamy on the tongue with a long, soft taste. After that, taste for dryness. When it is oily, the gin is flavored with extracts. 
Rum Rum is the first liquor ever known to the whole world. It was first produced in Brazil, Barbados and Jamaica. What makes the rum different from the other liquors is the use of sugarcane as its main ingredient. The syrup, being derived from the sugarcane, is fermented and is further turned into rum. It is classified as light, gold and dark because of its different features. 

To check for the appearance of the rum, swirl it. The darker it is, the longer it has aged. If the rum is mellowed, aged rum can be a pleasure to smell. If it is younger, it might harm yournasal passages. Keep your nose above the glass’ rim for hints of butterscotch, vanilla, and some common flavors of rum. To taste the rum, sip it and savor the flavors. Just like the nose being able to get a number of flavors, so can the tongue. 
Tequila Tequila is most often made at a 38–40% alcohol content (76–80 proof), but can be produced between 35–55% alcohol content (70–110 proof). Though most tequilas are 80 proof, many distillers will distill to 100 proof and then dilute it with water to reduce its harshness. Some of the more well-respected brands distill the alcohol to 80 proofs without using additional water as diluents. It is common as shooters but also is a great mix for a variety of cocktail like tequila sunrise and margarita. 

To check for the appearance of tequila, look for its color. A change of color (yellow to brown) might indicate signs of extensive aging or tell you that caramel coloring was used. When you smell the tequila, smell it beneath the glass. It should have the “agave intensity”, indicating the amount of agave found in it. To taste the tequila, see if it can deliver the same intensity as it had when you smelled it. If the taste is short, numb, medicinal, or bitter, the tequila will not be among the best. 
Vodka Vodka is a distilled beverage and one of the world`s most popular liquors. It is composed primarily of water and ethanol with traces of impurities and flavorings. Vodka is made from fermented substances like grain and potatoes. 

The word ""vodka"" was recorded -for the first time in 1405 in the court documents from the Palatinate of Sandomierz in Poland; at these times the word referred to medicines and cosmetics. A number of Russian pharmaceutical lists contain the terms ""vodka of bread wine"" and ""vodka in half of bread wine “As alcohol had long been used as a basis for medicines, this implies that the term vodka could be a noun derived from the verb vodit ’,""to dilute with water"". 

Originally, vodka was the pride of Eastern Europe. Vodka is made from grain, potatoes, beets, and from a variety of other plants. The sugar produced from the plants, which undergoes fermentation and distillation, is the result of neutral vodka. It does not need to age in wooden casks over a period of time; however, it can be flavored with a variety of fruits and herbs to enhance its color and taste. 
Whiskey Whisky (Scottish English) or whiskey (Irish English) is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. Different grains are used for different varieties, including barley, malted barley, rye, malted rye, wheat, and maize (corn). Whisky is aged in wooden casks, made generally of white oak, except that in the United States corn whiskey need not be aged.   

To check for the appearance of the whiskey, hold it against a white background. The darkness of the whiskey indicates the age and the type of wood where the whiskey was stored. If you swirl and found tears forming against the side of the glass, it means that it is rich. To smell it, just raise the glass slowly under your nose. The whiskey’s smell is very rich but not overpowering. To taste it, just take a small sip which should tell you about the flavor used. 
Where You Can Learn There are lots of online sites where you can learn how to do spirit tasting, ranging from average spirit tasting to spirit connoisseurs. There are also spirit tasting events being held several times a year. You should consult your events directory to learn if there are spirit tasting events near your area. 
Tips for Spirit tasting • Pour small amounts of liquor for each tasting. The typical amount can range from half an ounce to one ounce. The higher the amount of liquor being added, the higher the alcohol content that will be received. When the person’s tolerance for alcohol is not that high, he/she may not be able to taste it well. 

• Choose a glass where the wine can be well-distinct. The reason why glass is preferred and that it should be stemmed glassware (glass with a rim that curves inward at the top) is because the body heat from the person’s fingers should not warm up the liquor. 

• Check more about the liquor by checking the labels. The person can also research more about it through its manufacturer/company’s website or from reviews regarding that spirit. 
Spirit/liquor Tasting Benefits We always watch and hear these words “drink moderately” in every liquor or alcohol drink commercial. We know that drinking too much alcohol is risky for our health. But it’s also an irony that drinking moderately can be good for our health. Ethanol, for instance, is a pure form of alcohol that is found in all alcoholic drinks, and has a positive effect on our heart such as raising the positive cholesterol levels, preventing blood clots, and reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke. Drinking alcohol in a moderate manner can also increase our insulin sensitivity that can hinder diabetes, cancer, and bone loss. 

Red wine is on the top of the list when it comes to the benefits it can give to our heart. It has been studied and researched on how red wine contributes to the good conditions of the heart. According to the studies conducted, it is because of the phenol found in the wine. The contents function as an anti-oxidant which can promote cardiovascular health. It also reduces artery spasms which are caused by stress. Research also shows that people from France suffer less heart diseases compared to the people from U.S. Researchers concluded that French drink more red wine then people in United States and that was the reason for the decreased heart diseases.",
Web Site Design,"Web Site Design Information Introduction The Internet these days is where millions of people gather their information, news, and connect with friends, family, and even strangers. There is an enormous amount of potential for anyone with a little time, patience, and moxie to create and design their own website. The software programs that are used by professionals are often out of reach financially for a majority of these weekend website warriors, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t take charge and build some impressive websites of their own. 

Even the most ardent web designers are looking to other methods for web design, features, and versatility because there are numerous free templates as well as templates that are available for purchase or for free that allow one to alter, tweak, and build off of them. The world of website design has continued to evolve and change through the years and as it has done so, especially with the advent of Web 2.0, it has become both much simpler, but also more versatile than ever before. 

If a person has an interest in website design, or need to develop one for their own personal business, they no longer have to pay thousands of dollars for a professional looking site, especially if they don’t have those kinds of funds lying around. All they need is a web address (a domain) and a hosting company and from there, it’s strictly a matter of figuring out what kind of design they want, the purpose of the website, and determining how much they want to spend, if anything on their new website. 

Website designs can range from basic to visually intensive, from personal to business based, complete with shopping carts and checkout features. If you have heard about blogging and blogs, such as Wordpress or Blogger, these blogging platforms are very versatile and give the most novice individual access to a number of templates and tools to design and grow their own website.  Basics of Web Design What a lot of people don’t fully understand about web design is that without a plan in place before setting out to build the website, regardless of the type that they are planning on building, the function and form of the website will likely fail. The first thing that you should do when designing your first website is to use a sheet of paper, or a notepad, and lay out a plan for your website. 

Websites across the World Wide Web vary greatly from one to another. There is no right or wrong format of template to use. Yet every single website has a landing page. This is usually, but not always, the home page. The home page, or landing page, is the first page that potential visitors will see when they type in your website’s url.   What is a url? The url is the web address that a person types in to find your website. Google, for instance, is a url. Think of the url as your home or business’s address. Without an address, it would be impossible for people to find out where you live or where to go to do business with you, right? Every website that is launched does need a url for others to find it. 

Do you need a url to begin web design? No. There are a number of programs, such as Adobe’s Dreamweaver, that allow you to build your website offline, using the files on your computer as the home base. This website design will allow you to click on and open new windows, as long as you have created the files for them. But what point is it in building a website that you’re not planning on launching for people on the Internet to find? There’s not much point, actually. 

Before you start designing your website, go to a domain registry, such as GoDaddy to find a web domain address. The name you choose should have something to do with your business and the shorter and easier it is to remember, the more success you will have with it. If you are building your first website for your thoughts, then your name could be a good url. Many urls have already been taken, but these registry companies will often suggest other potential urls for you to use. 

If you don’t want to pay for it, there are some that you can find that are free. You can also go to a blogging platform, such as Wordpress or Blogger, and get a url for free, though it will always be preceded by the company’s name before your own.   Web design layout Once you know your url, then you have the name for your website. Next it’s time to figure out how many pages you want your website to have. Each time your visitor has to click on a link and are brought to another web address, even if it’s under your url, that is another page. Most website basics have the following: 

• Home page • About Us/Me page • Contact Us/Me page 

These are the basic pages. You may want to have more pages, offering more information, especially if you are designing this website for a potential business you want to operate. So, figure out what pages you will want to have for your website. Try to keep it simple, however, since you’re new to the design aspect. 

Once you have your pages figure out (limit them to seven in the beginning), then you’re ready to start developing the content layout.  Layout Again, you want to design your layout on paper before attempting to build it with a web design program. If you are going to use a blogging platform, then it’s a good idea to also lay out what you want on paper. The reasons for this are simple: if you know what you want, then it will be easier to spot when you come across it. If you don’t know what you want, then you are going to be throwing darts in the dark, so to speak, and you might find a template that looks cool, but is not going to work for you in the long run. 

Start with your home page. Visit a number of websites and get a feel for what inspires you to want to know more about the person or business. Figure out what kind of layout appeals to you the most. Use these sites as references for your own design and begin to structure your basic website along those lines. 

Every home page should have a menu of the other sub-pages that is easy to see and simple to find. These links to your other pages could run across the top, on the left side, or occasionally on the right side. They should never be along the bottom unless you don’t want people to find them.   Common sight locations The average Internet user will notice the upper left corner of the page first. This is usually where logos or a single photo is placed. It’s also generally where the website name is located. 

At the bottom right of the page is generally what’s known as a ‘call to action.’ This is like a ‘Buy It Now’ feature that entices people to know more or contact you. Everything else in between can either be missed or ignored, but if you have those two elements in place, then your website design will be effective.   Page length In the days before Web 2.0, people designed websites with a tremendous amount of text. Too much, in fact. Even today, home pages are constantly overloaded with content. Sub-pages are where you want to put the meat and potatoes of your website. These can actually be of any length, really, but you do want to remember that the longer the page, the more important layout will be for your visitors. 

Imagine visiting a website that has pages and pages of text without any breaks in it, no paragraphs, no bullet points, no images or graphics. It’s like reading a very dull and overly boring book and you won’t capture much attention. For a large amount of text, unless you are writing stories, keep the layout pleasing to the eye.   Images and videos Images and videos are a great asset for almost any website, but the more than you have on your website, the slower the website will load. Use images that are small in file size, user-friendly for the web, and link to videos such as Youtube.   Look at the website load time When you begin designing websites, you need to focus on load times for your web pages. Load times are measures of how long the page will take to open based on different connection speeds. While most of the first-world countries now seem to have high-speed Internet connections these days, that’s not always the case; millions of people still connect using dial-up services. 

If you are planning on attracting people to your website, then the slower it loads the more likely it will be that they give up and move onto another site. When you add too many images or images and graphics that are large files, you slow down the load time for the website. Limit these and try to keep your load times to under two seconds for high speed access.  Search Engines and Optimization When you start with website design, the first thing that you will want to focus on is learning the process of design. Once you have the design aspect down and are working on improving your skills, the next thing you will want to do is focus on search engine optimization, or SEO for short. 

The Internet is a vast open highway of information, yet unless people can find your website, it will sit there in the middle of cyberspace unnoticed. Search engines are the most common and popular way that Internet users find websites and in order to most high enough on the rankings, you need to add appropriate keywords to your website’s content. 

For more information on SEO, simply search the term in any search engine and you will find a host of information to improve your website’s search engine ranking.  Frequently Asked Questions I’ve heard that website design is very complex. I’m not very computer savvy. Is there hope for me? 

With the advent of some amazing programs, as well as a host of templates that exist on the web for free use, or even low-cost use, anyone can be able to design their own website, either as a hobby or a future profession. 

Doesn’t website hosting and design programs cost a lot? 

There are a number of free hosting plans that exist, as well as some very basic and free web design programs that anyone can use. There are some basic stipulations for their use, though, such as allowing advertising on the site in inconspicuous places, but if you are under a tight budget, these options are great.  Conclusion Contrary to some common beliefs that had lingered through the years, website design is much easier and more practical for just about anyone to do. While most novices are not going to be able to compete with the experienced professional website designers, as there are many levels and layers of programming that can be carried out to make a website appeal to a wider audience, the basics are all the same. 

Website design is a great way for creatively minded people to stretch themselves and discover their inner genius. Ultimately, with so many free templates that exist and a variety of design and programming options, there is basically no limit to the type, style, or function that a person can tackle when it comes to website design. Ten years ago, the idea that anyone could design a website was almost laughable. Today, it is almost an expectation. 

If you have the desire to start designing your own website, whether for fun or for profit, there are plenty of resources at your disposal to create some awe-inspiring and wonderful websites.",
Reading,"Reading Information  Intro Reading is a common hobby and one that can trace its origins back many hundreds of years. A love of literature later in life may be sparked by an interest in reading children`s literature as a child. One of the great benefits of reading as a hobby is that it can be taken up and put down whenever a free moment presents itself. When reading paperback books, it is easy to take the reading material on holiday or on public transport with very little inconvenience. One great advantage is that it allows the human mind to create its own view of the world portrayed in the book, something that can be disappointing when a book is made into a play for television or into a film. 

To begin your new-found hobby in reading, you should visit your local library. A library card can be had for free, and the library has its own built-in search engine, the librarian. He or she will be more than happy to help you find something to read, but it helps to have a general knowledge of how a library works. 
The Library Books are basically found in two categories, fiction and non-fiction. Fiction means that the story is made up and non-fiction is true. With the exception of most fictional works, books in the library are categorized according to the Dewey Decimal System. The Dewey Decimal System is very precise, and the following information on it is quite basic. 

The main categories are as follows: 

000 – Computer science, information and general works 100 – Philosophy and psychology 200 – Religion 300 – Social sciences 400 – Language 500 – Science 600 – Technology 700 – Arts and recreation 800 – Literature 900 – History, geography, and biography 

So, if you had just finished reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, for example, and wanted to know more about Mark Twain, the author of the book, you would look in the 900 section, under biographies. Actually, you would look in 921, to be exact. This is the Dewey number for all single person biographies. Collective biographies, such as those of all four of the Beatles, would be in 920. Although 800 is listed as literature, it is found in the non-fiction section of the library. It is where you would find poetry, plays, Shakespearean works and the like. Also, 398.2 is the classification for fairy tales, almost always found in the non-fiction section of the library. 

Now that we have had our short tour of our local library, let us discuss genres of books. The word genre simply refers to a category of some sort of artistic endeavor (in this case writing) that has a specific content or form. While this list does not comprise the entire list of genres of books, it does represent the most popular ones. 
Genres We would like to stress that even though some of these genres are written for juveniles, there is no such thing as certain books for certain people. There are many adults who enjoy what is classified as children’s literature. J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series is a wonderful example of that. By the same token, there are many children and teens who enjoy what would be considered adult literature, such as Bram Stoker’s Dracula. 

Following the explanation of each featured genre, we supply a basic list of books that represent most aspects of the subcategories, to get you started. These lists are by no means the be all and end all, they are merely a suggestion.  
Classics These books are called classics because they have stood the test of time and are still standing. Many classic works of literature have been made into movies, many of which are much beloved, but the movie never tells what the book does. If you enjoyed Gone with the Wind, for example, why not try reading it the way Margaret Mitchell intended for the story to be told, instead of Hollywood’s version? These books often are the base of other great pieces of literature. Other popular classics are: 

Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain Dracula by Bram Stoker Little Women by Louisa May Alcott Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne Frankenstein by Mary Shelley  
Fantasy Fantasy is characterized mainly by the presence of things that could never happen in real life, such as magical beings and talking animals. Today the most popular fantasy books are J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series, a series of seven books about a young wizard named Harry Potter and his adventures. 

Some great fantasy novels are: 

The BFG by Roald Dahl Life of Pi by Yann Martel Peter and Wendy by J.M. Barrie The Shannara series by Terry Brooks The Thief Lord by Cornelia Funke Ye Gods! by Tom Holt On Stranger Tides by Tim Powers Eragon by Christopher Paolini M is for Magic by Neil Gaiman Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin  
Historical Fiction Historical fiction tells a story that is set in the past. That setting is usually real and drawn from history, and often contains actual historical persons, but the principal characters tend to be fictional. 

Some recommended and popular historical fiction titles are: 

Ragtime by E.L. Doctorow The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett Tales of the South Pacific by James Michener The Wishing Game by Patrick Redmond Sharpe by Bernard Cornwell The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro Laura Blundy by Julie Myerson My Antonia by Willa Cather The Earth’s Children by Jean M. Auel Empress Orchid by Anchee Min  
Horror Horror’s primary trait is that it provokes a response, emotional, psychological or physical within each individual which causes someone to react with fear. One of the most famous horror writers is Stephen King. Nearly all of Stephen King’s horror novels have been made into movies, and if you have seen the movie and enjoyed it, the book is, by far, much more scary.

Books into Movies Over the past one hundred years, there have been thousands of movies made and a great deal of those movies came from books. The librarians, book shop keepers, and book lovers of the world would agree with us when we say, read the book. It is so much better than the movie. The movie often tells the basic storyline of the book, but can’t possibly go into the rich details that reading the book for yourself, provides. Some movies, like “Matilda,” follow the book fairly closely. Others, like “Jumanji,” are nothing like the book. Please take the time, if you enjoyed the following movies, to enjoy the books even more.

Conclusion There is no greater satisfaction in life than reading a good book. It has the ability to transport you through a maze of emotion, often holding you until the last page. Our elementary school teachers strove hard to expose us to many different genres of books to challenge us, and to help us find the niche that would propel us into a lifetime of reading enjoyment. When we were children, who among us didn’t identify with Stuart Little, Arthur, Hans Brinker or Charlie Bucket? Come and join the millions of happy people who make reading their hobby and find a new character to identify with and call your friend.",
Paintball,"Paintball Information  Introduction

 Paintball is a fun sport that can be played as an individual sport as well as between two or more opposing teams. It basically simulates the combat experience of an infantry soldier. It is one of the most action-packed and also one of the safest extreme sports. It is a better alternative to shoot ‘em up or first person shooter video games.

 Paintball is a highly gear dependent sport. The players have to shoot paintballs from their guns that use compressed air. If you get hit with a paintball by your enemy, you will be disqualified from the game. Many people are under the misconception that being hit by a paintball can be very painful. The truth is that it hurts no more than a small pinch. Moreover, there are a number of safety regulations that are strictly imposed by most local governments. This is done to ensure that no harm comes to players during game play.
 
Paintball can be classified as both an indoor and an outdoor game. You can play paintball in your backyard, an open field, the forest, closed buildings or wherever you can get the permission. There are many affordable paintball ranges and fields where you can enjoy the game with your friends and family members. Many local communities organize paintball wars every year to re-enact a historic battle that took place in their neighborhood.




The game is legal in most countries and the gaming equipment is easily available. Depending on your preferences, you can either buy the equipment, or you can rent it for a short time and save money. If the idea of shooting paintballs at people and capturing flags with lots of adrenalin sounds fun and interesting to you, then you should definitely take up this hobby. 

 Game Objectives

 Usually, the objective of the game is either one of the following two types.




1. Havoc Play – This is also known as elimination. In this form of game, you have to mark every one of your opponents. The last man or team standing wins the game.




2. Capture Play – In this form of play you have to usually capture an object such as a flag from your opponents. However, in some variations, your team might have to gain physical control over key opponent buildings or strongholds, such as bunkers or a fortress.




Wherever permitted, players usually wear camouflage or solid color fatigues to improve stealth. They usually wear uniforms of different shades or an arm patch to distinguish friends from foes during the game play. The duration of the game play is highly variable. It could be anything from a few minutes to a few days. All these variables depend upon the venue of the game play. For instance, if the game is being conducted in your backyard, you can expect it to be over in a relatively short time. However, for actual battle re-enactments, the game may continue for a number of days.
 Equipment
 As stated earlier, paintball is a game that depends entirely on equipment. Here is a short guide that gives you basic introduction about your equipment. You will also find important instructions about cleaning and maintaining your expensive markers.


1. Essential Weapons
 A paintball gun, better known as a paintball marker, or simply a marker, is the primary weapon of paintball wars. It is the most vital piece of equipment, apart from the security gear. They throw paintballs at you at speeds of around 200 miles per hour. However, this is not hazardous as it can cause nothing more than minor bruises in worst cases. They are available in two types: the old style spring loaded mechanical markers with a limited rate of fire; and the advanced electronic markers with a very high rate of fire that is quite similar to machine guns.




The next in your list will be propellants for pumping the paintballs. They come in small cylinders that are attached to your markers. These propellants are usually of three types: carbon dioxide, nitrogen and propane. Out of these three, nitrogen is usually preferred due to its safety, performance and affordability. Carbon dioxide might cause some technical problems in markers like leaking, and propane is usually overkill. If you are a newbie at paintball wars, it is recommended that you use nitrogen tanks.

 You cannot win a war without bullets! Before buying paintballs, ensure that they are of decent quality and purchased from a reputable provider. You must ensure that they are completely non-toxic and compatible with your model of paintball gun. If the manufacturers of your markers recommend certain brands of paintballs, you should stick to those.
  
 2. Safety Equipment
 Safety should be your foremost concern while playing this game, from masks and padding to safety pants. Without the proper safety gear, you can sustain a permanent injury, especially in your eyes. The main pieces of safety equipment that are used in this game are masks and barrel blocks.
 
Masks: Sometimes called ""goggles"", masks are safety devices that players are required to wear. These completely cover the eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils of a person. Some masks even feature throat guards. The lenses are designed to protect against paintballs traveling up to 300 feet per second, but are not guaranteed to withstand impacts at greater speeds.
 
Generally, more expensive masks tend to be smaller (which in turn makes the player a smaller target), more comfortable, have more interchangeable parts and be made of soft enough material to get some bounces.




It should be noted, that while playing paintball, even just shooting at the ground or trees, wearing proper paintballing masks is mandatory for safety. Some paintballs are very thick and can bounce off the ground, and other objects, and hit people




Barrel Blocks: A barrel block is a family of safety devices that mechanically obstruct the end of the marker`s barrel. They are intended to ensure that, should all other safety devices incorporated in the marker fail or be deactivated, a paintball fired by the marker will not leave its barrel and cause injury. Barrel blocks are usually required by commercial fields, to be used on any marker that is in an area where masks are not required. Forgetting to replace it after leaving a game and entering a safe zone will usually earn a warning. Repeated infractions will often result in ejection from the site. This is done for liability reasons and to lower possibility of unexpected injury to anyone around, especially important when involving eye safety.




Please note that safety equipment is mandatory for use in all paintball ranges and also according to the laws imposed by various governments. You should not attempt to play paintball without this safety gear.


4. Cleaning and Maintenance
 Paintball equipment is not only expensive, it is also critical for your safety. Therefore, it is very important that you invest enough time in its maintenance and cleaning. Poorly maintained markers may result in critical malfunction in the thick of the fight, jeopardizing not only your victory but also your safety as well as that of your teammates and your opponents.


Marker maintenance
 O-rings are one of the most sensitive parts of your marker. You should check them at least once every 30 days, or after every game, whichever is earlier. The only way to ensure that your O-rings last long is to apply lubricants regularly. If you feel any air coming out of these rings, replace them before the next use.

Markers require a thorough cleaning after every game. When you disassemble a marker, you will find lots of paintball residue inside. They tend to create obstructions in the path of the projectile during fire. This could lead to a very serious malfunction, such as the bursting of paintball inside the barrel. You should clean with a squeegee dipped in a mild solution of soap. After that, wash it one more time with clean water and leave it until it dries


5. Rent or Buy
 Most newbies are confused about whether they should buy new gear or rent it for the day. If you think that you will not be able to put your equipment to regular use, then it is better that you rent it. This is because paintball gear demands a lot of care and maintenance. If you are not going to use your gear for a long time, it might not be of any use to you when you try it the next time.
 
However, if you do decide to rent the equipment, you must ensure that it is of acceptable quality. If it looks too old or if you think that it is not in good condition, you should ask your provider to arrange for other pieces. You may need to shop around a little to find top-quality rented equipment for a good price.


6. Prices
 Markers usually range from $80 to $200. If you want small paintball handguns, then you can get them for less than $80. A top-notch paintball rifle might even cost you up to $700. However, for most people, a $120 marker will be more than enough.
 
While buying masks, it is important that you choose only anti-fog or thermal masks. They are available in the range of $30 to $70. Some funky masks might also cost you $135. However, it is important to ensure that you are paying because it really works and not just for the flaunt value. Safety should be your priority, not looks.

 The air tanks cost you from $30 to $60, depending upon their type and volume. They are easily and cheaply refilled. However, you should keep in mind their expiration date. It is not legal to get a tank refilled after it has expired.
 
The paint balls come dirt cheap. You can buy a thousand of them for less than $20.
 
7. Where to Buy

 The best place to but such merchandise is the internet. Most online stores sell paintball accessories and gear at very affordable prices and come with free shipping. However, if you know of a reputable hobby shop in your area, you should definitely try that. This is mainly because of warranty. If ever any problem arises with the guns or other equipment, it will be easier to get it serviced or replaced by your local merchant. If, in any case, you decide to buy from the internet, you should make sure you understand the warranty and returns policies from the merchant. Make sure that you are buying only reliable equipment so that it lasts a long time. 

 Tips and tricks

 
1 Recon – Try to have a glance through the field prior to the match. This will help you indentify some of the best natural cover areas. Discuss your findings with your teammates.





       
2 Plan – You can’t win without a plan of action. Make a brief assault plan and discuss it briskly with all your teammates. Ensure that everybody understands their respective duties.





     
3 Communications – You will have to learn to speak without any ambiguity. Communications is the key to victory. Try to keep contact with your buddies though hand signals and stuff!





       
4 Squad Play – Divide your team into squads or troops of equal or varying strength. Assign them with responsibilities to capture various key positions. Detail some at least one squad to launch a pseudo-attack from your false front. This will confuse your opponents and they will not be able to anticipate your moves.





     
5 Be Calm – Do not panic and do not try to be a hero. You are no good for your team if you are disqualified. Take decisions with a cool mind even in the thick of a fight. Do not rush into enemy territory acting like Rambo. You’ll end up being out of the game after shooting a couple of opponents.






     
 Frequent Questions

 ’’’1. I am not an adult. Can I play paintball? ’’’
Answer: Every state and country has varying laws about allowing non-adults to play paintball wars. Some jurisdictions allow minors to play this game if they have the written consent of their parents. You should check with your local authorities.
 
’’’2. I want to play paintball, but I’m worried about spoiling my clothes. Are the paintball stains washable?’’’
 
Answer: Usually paintballs today are made from washable chemicals. You should confirm this when you’re buying the paintballs. Remember that good quality paintballs will be easier to wash off. However, these are also more expensive. In any case, it is recommended that you use old clothes because they may get really dirty during game play. You might not be able to use them again even after washing off the paint. 
 Conclusion

 Paintball is a spectacular and exciting sport. It’s not only fun, but it’s also very engaging. Laying a siege means you’ll burn lots and lots of calories, not to mention that it helps to hone your leadership skills. It also teaches you how to make effective decisions under stressful circumstances.",
Historical Reenactments,"Historical Reenactments Information  Introduction Historical reenactment is a type of role play in which participants attempt to recreate some aspects of a historical event or period. This may be as narrow as a specific moment from a battle or as general as interacting with others at a certain time period. 
Types of Events Many castles, museums, and other historical tourist attractions employ actors or professional reenactors as part of the experience. These usually address the recreation of a specific town, village, or activity within a certain time frame. Commercial reenactment shows are usually choreographed and follow a script. Some locations have set up permanent authentic displays. By their nature, these are usually living history presentations, rather than tactical or battle reenactment, although some host larger temporary events. 

The Old South in the U.S. provides excellent scenarios for reenactments of true battles on their own turf. Reenacting the American Civil War began even before the real fighting had ended. Civil War veterans recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about. The Great Reunion of 1913, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, was attended by more than 50,000 Union and Confederate veterans and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including Pickett`s Charge. Modern reenacting is thought to have begun during the 1961–1965 Civil War centennial commemorations. Reenacting grew in popularity during the 1980s and 1990s, due in large part to the success of the 125th Anniversary reenactment near the original Manassas battlefield, which was attended by more than 6,000 reenactors. That year, Time magazine estimated that there were more than 50,000 reenactors in the U.S. In 1998, the 135th anniversary re-enactment of the Battle of Gettysburg took place near the original battlefield. There have been several estimates on the number of participants, but it is widely agreed that it was the largest re-enactment ever held anywhere in the world, with between 30,000 and 41,000 re-enactors participating. This event was watched by about 50,000 spectators. 

A highly popular type of reenactment is that of the Renaissance period. Though festivals are generally highly commercialized, there are hard core devotees who let down (or braid) their hair for the events, which are held usually on weekends across the country. Staged jousting events attended by exquisitely dressed royalty and court members are considered the highlights of the day, and actors representing the gamut of the social classes are continually in character while on site. Camelot and Robin Hood are very popular themes at these festivals, though pirates have worked their way into the mix since the advent of Pirates of the Caribbean. While it is usually very easy to tell the actors from many of the patrons at Renaissance festivals (ticket-paying guests, even in costume, will usually insist on sporting their shades, tennis shoes, watches, baseball caps, and cell phones), there are the devout few who have done their research so well that they might as well be at cast call. Street musicians often play period instruments, such as lutes and harp. But again, you will be much more likely to see more “modern” instruments, such as guitars. 

Another popular activity for enthusiasts throughout the U.S. is something called a “Rendezvous.” It is generally geared to reenact the days of the mountain man and fur trading. 
Getting Started The best place to start (as with most hobbies) is to gather information. Read books and use the internet to get detailed information on the experiences the people of “your” period lived out on a day-to-day basis. Learn what was important to them. Watch movies and plays to get a good feel for speech patterns and inflections, and study what they are wearing to see what sort of clothing would suit you. There are patterns and websites all over where you can get ideas and put together plans for your first costume. Depending on how period-proper you want to be, you may find yourself stitching by hand! 

Practice your skill at doing various period-specific activities. For example, if you choose a culture that hunted with bows, find a place to practice archery (preferably with a long bow). If black powder was the method in use at the time, find a place to purchase a replica and a location for shooting (not all ranges allow black powder shooting). If you want to learn to spin, start by learning to card wool and make it into yarn. Don’t let your location stop you--most of these things are easy to find on the internet. If you want to learn to fence or fight with swords, take a class or get connected with your local Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) (more on them later). 
Costuming Costuming will all depend on your character, of course. A simple peasant’s shirt and a doublet are going to cost you far less time and money than the rich brocades of royalty and generals. Also, whether or not you’re able to sew your own might make a difference. Often, though, it’s not so much the materials as it is the complexity that will matter. Leather and thick clothing will require special needles. Items that require a lot of gathering (as opposed to the straighter lines of Medieval clothing) will need more attention. It is sometimes just best to leave it to the pros and order, either from a catalogue or online. Various stores brag of their ability to produce period-perfect clothing for LARP (for live Action Role Play). 
Swords and Firearms Much care must be taken in what is used (or more importantly not used) in historical reenactments. While realistic is very good, real can result in some very harmful mishaps. Canon fire has been known to set dry fields ablaze during civil war demonstration, and real weapons should never be using more than blanks. Western action shooting can have its drawbacks, as well; a horse is likely to shy from gunfire of any sort. An organized group of reenactors must be in touch with land owners and fire marshals to get permission to perform. All sword play and fencing should be done will dull weapons for obvious reasons. 

“Combat reenactment has an emphasis on maintaining the balance between accuracy and safety. For example, the recreation of the American Civil War battles are very strongly regulated and may involve safety wear and of blanks, despite their historical inaccuracy. Combat reenactment seeks not only to recreate the martial history of them but to also educate people about the respect and proper handling of dangerous weapons.” (From “The Reenactor” website.) 
Resources and Networking As mentioned earlier, the Society for Creative Anachronism is pretty much the “industry standard” for reenactments. The SCA has a highly structured system for incorporating members from all over the world, especially those interested in Medieval and Renaissance reenactments. There are recognized “kingdoms” of members from all over the world, and the SCA program provides opportunities for tournaments, royal courts, feasts, dances, and workshops. It is here you can learn to prepare traditional foods, learn how to handle heavy weaponry, write sonnets, make candles, and pretty much anything else that would be of value to someone living during Medieval or Renaissance times. 

Men and women can join various Civil War reenactment units and companies through the Civil War Reenactment Headquarters online (probably the only place where you can enlist with a Civil War commander with an e-mail address!). There are groups all along the east coast, in the deep south, and even as far west as Missouri and Colorado. 

Other groups available as resources specialize in the following areas, and they can be found on the internet: World War I, World War II, Wars of the Roses, Napoleonic Wars, Colonial New Zealand Wars, 1814 from the UK perspective, 1186 to 1188 dedicated to Middle Eastern, Christian, and Muslim traditions, Tudor and Medieval, Dark Ages, English Civil War, Ancient Greece, British Regency, period living and primitive wilderness survival skills for the years 1680-1760 in the New World, southern Germany from late antiquity to Charlemagne, and Vikings and Normans circa 400 to 1200. 
A Day in the Life There really is nothing quite like spending a day in costume, away from the trappings of city life. For that one day, you can be literally anyone else you like, and no one will question you about it. Spending a day outside heightens your senses to the elements past cultures may have experienced-- everything from the dampness of the morning all the way through a dusty afternoon or late afternoon rainstorm. Necessity forces you to find shelter or provisions on your own or accept being soaked to the bone in full costume. You will meet others who are dressed as you are and who may have valuable advice that they’re willing to share about setting up camp, working a particular demonstration, or even working with an ever-changing crowd of spectators. In the case of a Renaissance fair, this might be perfecting a subtle magic trick or a ballad to sing. In the case of a Civil War living history demonstration, it might be about adding some quick historical blurbs during the loading of a canon. If you are one of the women working with others to prepare a venison feast with quail egg appetizers and turnip soup, the knowledge passed from one to another is truly how it was done in early times, when the only translation between generations was word of mouth. Being in costume gives you the appreciation of how it really felt to have to move about in the heat and discomfort of a heavy uniform. Interactions with other characters train you to focus on the matters at hand—discussion of “mundane” (or contemporary) topics is not allowed. This can be incredibly freeing for anyone who wants to forget work for a while! Instead of watching television at night or listening to i-Pods, there is the opportunity to listen to night sounds and talk of the coming day. Musicians are afforded the opportunity to play into the night. With Renaissance fairs, music is often combined with belly dancing or set dances. In the case of the rendezvous, it will be fiddle or guitar, and perhaps even cowboy poetry. 

As for the children who grow up in families who do reenactments together? They benefit in ways that many children only dream of. Families tend to be more closely knit, and the children learn dozens of life skills some adults don’t even know.",
Whiskey - Scotch Tasting,"Whiskey - Scotch Tasting Information  Introduction: The word whiskey is derived from the term uisage beatha from Irish Gaelic which means ‘the water of life’. It is spelled whisky when referring to the Scotch whisky, Canadian Whisky or Welsh Whisky. However an e is added in it when referring to the American and Irish whiskey. 

The drink is made by the distillation of grains and then aging the resultant alcohol in oak casks. Like other grain alcohols, whisky can be made by the moisture of many different kinds of grains. Most commonly used grains for whisky are corn, wheat, rye and barley. As commonly barley is used in the making of the drink, it is also known as the ‘juice of the barley’. 

A malt whisky is made by malting barley. By using only one grain for malting instead of a mixture of many grains, a single-malt whiskey can be made. Another type of whiskey is bourbon, in which corn comprises of more than half the grain used in its making. However this does not fully define bourbon. For bourbon it is necessary that the grain is distilled in Kentucky. This distinct alcohol is then left for a minimum of 36 months inside a charred white oak barrel to age and mature before it is brought in use. The alcohol content is as high as 160 proof after it has matured. It is mostly brought down between 80-100 proof before it is bottled. Sometimes the bourbon is sold at its cask strength which is normally 120 proof. 

The Irish whiskey is often single-malt barley made entirely from barley. The Irish whiskey may also be a pure pot still made from a mixture of malted or unmalted barley. The mixture may include wheat or corn alcohols blended in barley. The Scotch whiskey is most commonly known as the Scotch everywhere. Malted barley from a single distillery is used to make the most expensive and demanded whiskey the single-malt Scotch. The blended malt Scotch is made by malted barley and may contain batches from other distilleries. The single grain Scotch Is made by blending different grains but from same distillery. And lastly the blended grain Scotch is made by different grains from different distilleries. Of all the Irish whiskeys, the single-malt whiskey is known to be of the highest strength. 
Best Value Whiskeys Whiskey is one of the most popular liquors. The burning sensation that it gives to a person is one that has earned it popularity and respect. The most popular are the Irish, Scotch, bourbon and Canadian classic spirits. These have been distilled for many years and are widely known for their best taste. These due to their huge popularity and classic tastes tend to get expensive; however one can also find a brand that tastes great yet is affordable. Following are some brands that are not too pricy and offer one of a kind taste: 

’’’George Dickel’’’ 

George A. Dickel came up with a Tennessee variety but as it was’ as smooth as the finest Scotch’ it is called a Scotch whisky. Mr. Dickel had to compete with Jack Daniel- his whisky rival so he had to compete up with a whisky which beat him in quality. The Dickel whisky is priced at $20 to $ 25 per 750ml bottle. Hence it beats the Jack in price too. 

’’’Ezra Brooks’’’ 

This brand renders 90 proof bourbon. Unfortunately the like named label Evan Williams outshines this brand hence making it under-appreciated. But the brand offers quality and great taste at a very low price of $10 to $15 per bottle. The Ezra bourbon brings the burning sensation to the person from mouth to stomach yet it does not suppress the great taste of the drink from showing up. 

’’’Henry McKenna’’’ 

The Irishman Henry McKenna migrated in 1837 to Kentucky and brought with him the recipe of whisky with him. Hence the name of the bourbon sounds Irish. The ‘Kentucky’s finest Table Whiskey’ offers great taste and enjoys a better respect as compared to its counterparts which can be found at common restaurants’ and bars’ shelves. The bourbon comes at a very reasonable price of $10 to $15 yet it does not compromise on taste. 

’’’Canadian Mist’’’ 

The Canadian Mist provides the best offer to a blue collar worker. Unlike other Canadian blends it is not too sweetened and gives a smooth taste. The calm and mellow taste provided by the Canadian mist comes in a very reasonable price of $10 to $12. 

’’’Forty Creek’’’ 

Forty Creek has emerged as the most viable option for the youngsters who go for something edgier than usual. The Forty Creek is hard lined for a normal blended Canadian whisky yet it provides a great taste. The whisky is a bit expensive than other best value whiskies due to its irresistible taste and flavor. Despite its expensiveness it offers a cheap solution compared to its rival brands which are quite popular. Hence it has emerged as a challenge for them in the market. 
Winners of the World Whiskies Awards The Whiskey Magazine’s World Whiskies Awards awarded the title of ‘World’s Best’ to seven whiskies in the final round. Dave Broom, known as the international expert on whisky and an educator of fine whiskies throughout the world chaired the competition. The winners went through three rounds of blind testing before being declared as the victors. The World’s Best New Release was chosen in the final round of tasting. The categories in which the whiskies were judged were based on the production process of the whisky, blended whisky, malt whisky American whiskey, blended malt whisky and whisky liqueurs. Following are the winners of the competition:

How is Whisky Made Whisky is one of the most popular liquor known in the world and is being produced since hundreds of years. The drink comes with amazing different tastes, undertones and sensations. It is still unknown who invented this marvelous drink and the fight persists between the Scottish and the Irish. However both countries are known to produce great whiskies. 

Now the question arises how this fantastic drink is made. Well the ingredient list is quite short for whiskies. Quality and great taste is added by a starch base. The Scotch and Irish whiskies use barley as the base. The whisky recipe consists of only water, grain and yeast. Grain is however the starch which must be malted. 

The very initial step is the malting of the grain. The literal meaning of malting is beginning to grow again however the process used in making whisky involves the submersion of grain in water for a very long time period so that it is able to grow again. Then this is laid on a ‘malting floor’ beneath which a fire is lit to dry the grain. The Scottish uses the peat to dry out the grain. The peat is the compressed plant matter which is formed into cricks which are then burnt. The Scotch whisky is imparted with the distinctive feature of smoky notes because the peat gives off strong smoke. However the Irish whisky is less smoky because the grain used is a mixture of the malted and the unmalted grains which are not dried in the peat. Before the grain is put into the fermentation vessel known as the ‘mash tun’, it is dried and grounded into flour. In the fermentation vessel the grain is mixed with hot water and then the mixture is boiled so that the starch is turned into fermentable sugar. 

The fermentation process is the initialization of the whisky making process. Here the yeast is left to ferment. The process gives off heat and carbon dioxide. The resultant is called the ‘wort’ 6-10 % alcohol which is commonly known as beer. 

Now comes the distillation part. Here each distillery has its own unique shape and design. The liquid is poured into a copper still for distillation. The distillation mechanism lies on the simple theory of different boiling points of water and alcohol. Water boils at 100C while alcohol boils at 78.3C. This results in the earlier evaporation of alcohol leaving water behind. The alcohol evaporates into the copper still from where it draws its flavor and condenses back to its liquid form. 

The distillation is performed twice for Scotch and thrice for Irish Whisky. The triple distillation process used by Irish whisky results in the softer yet less flavorful whisky. 

Conventionally the Irish and the Scotch whiskies are aged in oak barrels for a minimum of 3 years. To add flavor, color and character to the alcohol, it is aged in the charred ex-bourbon white oak barrels. Some whiskies are added with additional flavor by putting them in sherry or pot barrels. 
Tips for Drinking Whisky Whisky has been popular among men for centuries and should be enjoyed to the fullest. And to do this a person must know how to fully appreciate a whisky’s flavor and aroma. For this a person must know the art of drinking it. Many people mix it with coke however the true essence lies in drinking it straight. A single-malt whisky should not be mixed with any soda if its true taste is to be discovered. A few drops of water would do justice and let you smell the fine aroma of a whisky. Follow the steps to enjoy the whisky in the true sense: 

1. Pour the whisky into a sherry or wine glass. Don’t take shots so you would require a wide glass. Get a glass that has curves on the top, this will help trap the aroma of whisky and let you sip easily. 

2. An ounce and a half is a good amount to start with. However you are free to pour as much as you like. 

3. To feel your drink, tilt your glass and observe the drink sliding to one side. Swirl the glass to observe the whisky better. Observe how dense the drink is. A thicker drink would come with a different texture and would show signs of a drink with higher amount of alcohol in it. 

4. Hold the glass up and observe it in light. Look for any variations in the drink. Particles in the drink would indicate a whisky of lower quality. 

5. Now it’s time to add water to the drink. Addition of water would free the aromas and flavors of the drink. Clean water free of any impurities must be used. Water with chlorine in it would result in some other flavor. One may add any amount of water, from two spoons to an equal amount of whisky. 

6. Now comes the part of ‘nosing’. This is when you may hold the glass close enough to your nose and inhale the aroma of the drink. Do not let the aroma burn your nose, just gradually inhale to feel the splendid smell of whisky. Try to identify all types of smells the whisky comes with. 

7. Now take a sip. Swish it around in your mouth so that you may feel it by every bit of your tongue and so that you pick up all the flavors the whisky offers. 

8. Now gulp down the drink from mouth down to your throat. Let the throat feel its warmth and repeat the process. 

So by these simple steps you can enjoy every sip of whisky to its fullest and feel all the different unique flavors and aromas that it comes with. 
Conclusion: Whisky has been popular since ages and men and women alike enjoy the passionate drink. The unique tastes and aromas which the drink ahs to offer will never let its love die from the hearts of people. Every drop of the drink must be enjoyed to its fullest to feel the true essence of whisky.",
Sculpting,"Sculpturing 101  Introduction Artists jokingly oversimplify the process of sculpting by saying it’s just a matter of removing all material that “doesn’t belong” in a block of stone or clay. Though that is the right idea, it is a little more difficult than that. Sculpting is three-dimensional art made by shaping and combining hard materials, such as marble, metal, glass, wood, or plastic material such as clay, textiles, polymers and softer metals. As with many of the arts, sculpting became more of a pastime as the practical needs for it were either perfected or dropped for more effective means. Creating with natural elements continues to take on some surprising innovative aspects, such as sculpting with sound and light. For the sake of concentrating on hobby sculpting, this article will only summarize some of the more recognized areas and detail the more practical or novel aspects. 
Stone Carving Sculpture, in one form or another, goes back thousands of years. Some of the earliest forms found have, because of their durable nature, been carved in materials such as stone. The process of sculpting is basically the controlled removal of stone, whether it is from a single rock, or on large slabs, such as is found in the earliest forms known as petroglyphs. These were images created by removing part of a rock surface, which remains in situ by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. These paved the way for monumental sculptures, which cover large works, and architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings. Hardstone carving is the carving, for artistic purposes stones, stones such as jade, agate, onyx, rock crystal, carnelian, or sard. Engraved gems are small carved gems, including cameos, which were originally used to create rings worn to imprint personal emblems on documents with sealing wax. A sampling of famous stone and marble sculptures are the carved jade items of the Shang Dynasty, Michelangelo Buonarotti’s Pieta, Bernini’s Apollo and Daphne and of course, the Greek Venus di Milo, whose true sculptor may have been Alexandros of Antioch. 
Bronze Sculpture and Casting Bronze is the most popular metal for cast metal sculptures. A cast bronze sculpture is often called simply a “bronze.” Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mold. Their strength and lack of brittleness (ductility) is an advantage when figures in action are to be created, especially when compared to various ceramic or stone materials, such as marble. Typical artists famous for this type of sculpture are Myron’s Discus Thrower, Donatello’s David, Rodin’s Burghers of Calais and The Thinker, and more recently, Remington’s Bronco Buster (1909). 

Casting is a manufacturing process by which a liquid material is (usually) poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solid casting is then ejected or broken out to complete the process. Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that cold set after mixing of components (such as epoxies, concrete, plaster and clay). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. Casting is a 6,000-year-old process. The oldest surviving casting is a copper frog from 3200 BC. The casting process is subdivided into two distinct subgroups: expendable and non-expendable mold casting. 

The methods used for small parts and jewelry vary a bit from those used for sculpture. A wax is obtained, either from injection into a rubber mold, or it is custom-made in wax. Occasionally, a custom-made wax might be molded in rubber first as insurance against the loss of the unique wax and related labor costs incurred in carving it. Castings for smaller sculptures, such as jewelry, can be found in museums and modern galleries everywhere. Some good examples for inspiration can be found among items associated with the Shang Dynasty (hair pins, jewelry, and ritual items). Navajo jewelry is sand cast, making it interesting, as well (see “Other Natural Materials,” below). Also the work of contemporary Bob Burkett is made unique with the shubuichi technique, which has helped him produce small but outstandingly detailed pieces, i.e., beads. 
Clay Sculpture Probably the most popular sculpture method is that of clay. Clay is inexpensive and easy to work with, and the possibilities for firing techniques, glazes, and finishes are endless. Pottery is the form most often chosen for artists trying to sell their work because it is both aesthetic and useful. 

At the greenware state, the artist can choose to decorate the piece, either with paint or an underglaze. Cobalt blue paint, for example, is commonly used as an underglaze decoration on the traditional “blue and white” wares that come from China on rice bowls, etc. An overglaze pigment can be applied after the first firing. This is often the method of choice because more colors will “survive” the second, lower-heat firing. Enamel is the method of applying powdered glass as the overcoat to a piece of pottery, causing a durable and shiny result. Burnishing can be done at this state, though the piece is most likely to survive if it is done before the first firing, at the green “leathery” state. The results of using wooden or bone spatula, smooth stones, plastic, or glass bulbs will produce an extremely shiny effect. This can be done on the entire piece or only on parts, leaving some spots with a matte finish. 
Wood Carving Wood carving is a method of working with wood where a cutting tool is used to make a wood object. Figural carving seems to have been widespread. The carving to represent one`s god in a tangible form finds expression in numberless ways. The early carver, and, for that matter, the native of the present day, has found a difficulty in giving expression to the eye, and at times has evaded it by inlaying this feature with colored material. 

Whittling is a form of wood carving and is the simplest and cheapest means of creating something from almost anything. From walking sticks to delicate figures, about the only thing necessary is a whittling knife and a piece of wood. Some types of wood are softer than others, ranging from balsam (the most common lightweight media) to others, such as walnut and ebony (the hardest and most challenging with which to work). Rosewood is popular, especially for ornamentation on stringed instruments and inlays. 

Typical famous wood carvings are found on the doors and in much religious architecture throughout Eastern and Western Europe, and India. Africa and Oceania are famous for their carved masks and animal renditions. Some specific carvings include The Head of St. Anne by Tilman Reimanschneider, The Annunciation by Veit Stoss, and even a violin by Constantin Brancusi. 

In addition, very famous works of wood come in the form of musical instruments. Woodwind instruments, such as flutes and oboes, all the way to lutes, viols, and the rest of the string family range from the very simple carvings of bamboo (such as with the earliest flutes) to rosewood inlays and scrollwork found on lutes and other stringed instruments. The amazing thing about working with wood is that wood is not dead—its cells are alive, and temperatures, humidity, and age all affect its properties. When someone takes on the task of carving and varnishing an instrument (top, bottom, sides, etc.) he needs to take into account not only its immediate aesthetics but also how it will sound in the coming years. Sculpting with wood for pitch and resonance is no casual task, and it is no wonder the world still marvels at the accomplishments of Antonio Stradivarius to this day. 
Other Natural Materials The Navajo are an Athabascan people who migrated into the Four Corners region of the American southwest roughly 600 years ago. When they settled there, they were farmers and herders. However, when they came into contact with the Spaniards, they learned silver smithing skills and soon became top-notch jewelry designers. One common technique used by the Navajos is a method of sand, where molten silver is poured into a sand mold, and course, grainy marks are left in the finished piece. 

Silver may also be hammered or braided. Today, the most popular Navajo materials are silver, turquoise, coral, lapis lazuli, and malachite. They also use black onyx and several varieties of oyster shell. Traditionally, Navajo jewelry employed only materials found in the area where they lived, or traded for with other area residents. Today, however, they have expanded the numbers and types of gemstones they use, taking full advantage of internet suppliers and gem and mineral fairs. 
Sound Sculpture Sound sculpture is often the brainchild of a composer or musician who crosses over into an “interactive” piece of artwork. This can be demonstrated in something as simple as a wind chime or Aolian harp. One of the more sophisticated examples, however, is the Blackpool High Tide Organ in Great Britain, created by Liam Curtin and John Gooding. It interacts with wave energy and plays at high tide through eight pipes attached to a dyke. These pipes are connected to eighteen regular organ pipes in its promenade, and when the sea water swells, it pushes air into the pipes, making random sounds based on a harmonic series in B flat, a natural series of harmonics. Another example is found in San Francisco. It is called the Wave Organ, and listeners can sit among stones reminiscent of ancient ruins and listen to gurgling, sloshes and hissing sounds amplified by a series of pipes coming from underneath. Yet another work of art is the Singing Ringing Tree, designed by Mike Tonkin and Anna Liu of Tonkin Liu. It is located in Lancashire, and interacts with nature by using wind energy to produce chorales of pipe sounds spanning several octaves. 
Practical Summary For anyone picking up any new hobby, the wisest philosophy is to start small. See if you have an aptitude for it. Though it is important to have quality tools to do the right job, it is not necessary to pick up entire sets at once. For the first several pieces, buy them as you need them, (e.g., buy just one carving or whittling knife and one or two small blocks of wood). Or, with clay sculpture, buy small amounts of modeler’s clay or and practice on small pieces first—you don’t need a potter’s wheel right away. Practice imprinting with textures using common household objects, like spoon handles, stamps or popsicle sticks. It doesn’t need to be expensive. If you are finding you like what you see, start checking into some of the more sophisticated objects, and begin looking for studios in your part of town that make their kilns available or a small price. You can research books and the internet for methods and pointers. You can network with local hobbyists and attend workshops that come through your area. If your sculpture techniques are serving you well and you like your results, try looking for that “signature” style that will set you apart from the others. Whether it’s a specific color or glaze technique, or if it’s animal and tree carvings that set you apart, pick it and perfect it. At this point (if you choose to), you can participate in farmer’s markets, festivals, and even gallery openings to begin broadening your horizons. Just remember, though, unless you’re being commissioned to work on pieces for other people, there is no reason your hobby should be anything but just that—a hobby. If you fear that the task of creating is becoming tiresome, take some time off or try combining it with another art form or style, lest you begin to despise it. For example turn your project into a wind chime and see what sounds it makes. Use your wood carvings to imprint or adorn your pottery. A hobby should be fun!",
Reiki,"Reiki Information  An Introduction Reiki is a form of energy healing. Its roots can be traced back to the 1920’s in Japan. Pronounced “ray-kee”, Reiki can be roughly translated to mean “Universal Life Force” where Rei means Universal and Ki is Life force. The assumption here is that there is a power above us that binds us. This life force is accessible to us, so that we can channel it and then use it for healing. 

When you learn Reiki as a hobby, you will learn special symbols and hand positions that you will use for healing. At an advanced level, you will be attuned to Reiki by a master to enable you to heal yourself and others. 

Reiki is a spiritual practice developed in 1922 by Japanese Buddhist Mikao Usui that uses a technique commonly called palm healing as a form of complementary and alternative medicine and is sometimes classified as oriental medicine by some professional bodies. Through the use of this technique, practitioners believe that they are transferring healing energy in the form of ki through the palms. 

Legend has it that Mikao Usui received a flash of enlightenment after he meditated and fasted for 21 days on Mount Kurama in Japan. And thus was Reiki born. It is reputed to have begun as a step towards spiritual development. However, today it is mainly viewed as a therapeutic method. 

Reiki training has come a long way since Usui’s time and there are plenty of variations over the traditional Reiki. The basic practice still continues to be a hands on approach where the practitioner connects to the person who needs to be healed, and channels universal life energy into that person. 

Let us look at an in-depth history of Reiki and how it evolved. 
How Reiki works Now that you have decided to learn Reiki as a hobby, let us look at how Reiki works. Reiki is quite a simple process where the practitioner tunes into the Reiki energy. Then she channels it and directs it to the person who needs to be healed. The Reiki healer does this by resting her hands on or above the person to be healed, letting the energy flow from her palms to the person. The exciting thing about Reiki is that you can also perform distant healing, which means you could “send” Reiki to someone half way across the world!  
Whole Body Treatment In a typical whole-body Reiki treatment, the Reiki practitioner instructs the recipient to lay down, usually on a massage table, and relax. Loose, comfortable clothing is usually worn during the treatment. The treatment proceeds with the practitioner placing the hands on the recipient in various positions. Many Western practitioners use a common fixed set of 12 hand positions, while others use their intuition to guide them as to where treatment is needed as is the practise in Traditional Japanese Reiki, sometimes starting the treatment with a ""scan"" of the recipient to find such areas.  
Localised Treatment Localised Reiki treatment involves the practitioner`s hands being held on or near a specific part of the body for a varying length of time. There is great variation in the duration of such treatments, though 20 minutes is typical.  
Breathing Usui taught a technique called Joshin Kokyū-hō , which roughly translates as ""the breathing method for cleansing the spirit,"" though literally translates as ""Goddess Breath Method"". Joshin Kokyū-hō is performed by sitting straight, with the back aligned, breathing in slowly through the nose. 
The Principles Of Reiki Reiki is basically a spiritual practice. Usui’s Reiki concentrated on self-development, based on the concept that one must be able to control one’s attitude and thoughts. A person must also be able to develop serenity through a tranquil mind and be compassionate. It is then that the ability to heal develops. To accelerate the process of developing the right spirit, there are five principles of Reiki, which are principles for life and living that enable the person to heal him as well as others. When you learn Reiki, you will be urged to repeat the five principles aloud every morning and evening. 

• Just for today, I will give thanks for my many blessings • Just for today, I will not worry • Just for today, I will not be angry • Just for today, I will do my work honestly • Just for today, I will be kind to my neighbor and every living thing. 

There are different versions of these, but they all convey the same thing – tranquility, compassion and kindness. 
The Three Levels Of Reiki When you decide to start your Reiki training, your Master will explain that there are three different levels of training. Level I, II and III and each one has a special significance.  
Reiki Level I At level I, you get the foundation of Reiki. Your Reiki master will initiate you into Reiki through a process called attunements. Attunements give you the ability to channel Reiki healing energy and heal others. You will get an insight into Reiki’s history and its founder, Mikao Usui. You will also learn hand positions used in healing yourself as well as others.  
Reiki Level II Level II follows Level I, and helps you become a Reiki practitioner. At this stage, you become even more aware of Reiki and understand the healing session. While Level I focused on physical healing, Level II includes spiritual and emotional healing. You will also become initiated into the practice of distance healing, where you can “send” Reiki to someone far away. This level involves the use of Reiki symbols. You will learn to draw these and use them when you channel your Reiki to someone. Each symbol is significant for healing certain things and sometimes used in combination. Your Master will urge you to practice as much as possible before you move on to Level III.  
Reiki Level III Level III is the final phase of training to become a Reiki Master. Here you learn advanced healing techniques and tips to become a Reiki Master. You will also learn how to teach Reiki to others. This is the level where the fourth Reiki symbol is introduced to you and you will also learn how to attune others to Reiki. Depending on who your Master is, you may learn extra symbols to use when you practice. This phase is sometimes divided into three parts, namely, the Master Healer, Master or Teacher and Grandmaster. The Master Healer is at the highest level of Reiki healing. The Master/Teacher teaches level I and II to others. The Grandmaster teaches all levels. 
How To Learn Reiki Reiki is best learned from a Reiki Master who can train and attune you in the traditions and techniques of Reiki energy healing. Once you start learning Reiki, you have to practice healing yourself as well as others to become proficient. 

Reiki training classes are common. It is a good idea to talk to your friends to find out if they know any Reiki practitioners in your area. These masters offer classes. Your local community college may offer level I Reiki. In fact, Reiki is so popular today that your college may have a non-credit course. 

Some Reiki masters offer weekend classes. There are online and distance learning programs. No matter who teaches you, most Reiki training classes have a similar pattern. The first level usually attunes you to Reiki energy, gives you an overview of Reiki history and the techniques you need for self-healing and healing others. But the best way to be a Reiki channel or healer is to receive attunement from a Reiki master. 

To further enhance your knowledge, check out home study courses and online manuals that give you affordable training. Take the time to identify a good master who fits your style of learning. It is important to find someone who has a good reputation and is well-organized, so that you can expect good follow-up guidance and help. Get to know the costs and time involved before you decide. Costs vary from Master to Master. 
Some Frequently Asked Questions About Reiki Here are the answers to some frequently asked questions about Reiki: 

When Can I Start Healing Others? 

Right from the moment you receive your attunement. Ensure that you are grounded and drink a glass of water before you start. 

What Should I Think About During Self Healing? 

You should focus on something specific or chant the appropriate mantra. Visualize a halo of energy in the chakra you are healing in the related color. For instance, when you are healing the throat chakra, think about a blue sun emanating energy in the center of your throat. 

Is There A Specific Time For Healing Each Chakra? 

You will experience energy signals when you heal. The energy flows through you and when it abates, you can move to the next chakra. This should take approximately two to three minutes. Some chakras may involve more energy than others. 

Should I Consider The 21 Days From The Next Day Of The Class Or The Day Of The Class? 

In case you practiced full body self healing once more at home, you can count the day of the class as day one. If not, from the next day. 

Is It Okay To Do Reiki During Periods? 

Yes. There are no restrictions. 

How Much Time Does It Take For Reiki To Cure People With Diseases? 

Reiki works by starting at the root of any problem. If this is superficial, healing may be faster. If not, it could take a long time. Improvements will be visible in a gradual manner in the form of emotional stability, less stress, etc. Healing also depends on the willingness of the person to heal and the depth of the problem. 

What If I Don’t Feel Any Energy When I Heal? Should I Undergo Attunement Again? 

If you practice daily, you need not re-attune yourself. Initially, when you start learning Reiki your energy may be more. Over time, this reduces. It is important to practice on a daily basis.

Model Cars,"Model Cars Information  Introduction The term model car differs from the model of a car. The later refers to the style and shape of the vehicle. The former is a scaled representation of the vehicle. 

The world has always had a fascination with the automobile. Collectors of cars spend vast amounts of money to maintain and store the actual vehicle. Most people don’t have the money or space for such a collection. For these people who would like a similar collection, there is another option. 

Model kits of cars provide people with the detail of the real thing without the enormous expense the actual car comes with. It is an involving hobby that takes time and patience. The following sections cover the history and different types of model cars there are. 

Since this page covers the kit building aspect of model cars, we will look further into the model building process. The key elements of this involve the proper tools and preparations. The rest involves following instructions and/or your imagination. 
Getting Started With Collecting Model Cars When you get started with collecting model cars, the first thing is to decide on the scale – it could be 1:8; 1:18; 1:24; 1:43 and 1:87. The size most loved is the 1:43 and is called the collector’s scale. You get a huge range of models in this scale, mostly die cast or as kits that you can assemble. Collectors tend to collect the model of a particular brand, racing cars or cars that they love and have owned. Some of the most beautiful model cars are the classics from the 1920s and 30s, especially the Rolls Royces and Bugattis. There are several vintage cars in miniature on the market. 

The best point about collecting model cars are the contacts that you will develop with other collectors. It is a friendly community that helps each other in finding a rare model car. 
How Did Collecting Model Cars Become Popular As A Hobby As a hobby, collecting model cars has its origins in the post World War II when there were Ace and Berkeley wooden model cars. The first real plastic model car kit was made by Derk Brand in England. It was the model of a 1932 Ford Roadster. Later, he made model car kits for the Gowland Brothers in England and Revell in the US. 

Subsequently most car manufacturers made promotional models for their dealers on a 1:25 scale. Kids got to play with these and soon enough, they traded them or collected them as a hobby. As it happened, the hobby caught on during the 1950s and 60s, with promo cars actually bringing in a profit. Companies like AMT, Revell, Jo-Han and Monoram began making model car kits just around then. 
The Current Scenario With Model Cars Today, model car kits are technologically advanced and come with photo etched details, adhesive chrome foil for a chrome trim, engine wiring and aluminum billeted parts. In fact, this kit can be detailed to resemble an authentic car. Dinky cars, as the model cars are called, come with die cast alloy bodies and rubber tyres, like the real car. They also come with drivers and passengers. Around the time of the World War II, some unique military cars were made with tanks, caterpillar tracks and rotating turrets. 

Collectors of model cars often auction off the rarer models for thousands of dollars. Today, die cast model cars fetch the maximum profit. NASCAR die cast models are the most popular with collectors of model cars. If you happen to be a beginner, you would take a little time before you built the entire collection! 

The important thing about collecting model cars is to only collect items that you really like. It`s a good practice to collect only those items that you love and most collectors do some shopping around before finding the best buy. This helps them to trade the cars more easily or to sell them at a better price. 

Experts advise that you do not stick to a specific type of die cast models. It is better to build a diverse collection if you are thinking about profiting from your hobby. What appears low value today could appreciate unexpectedly over the passage of time. 

Older die cast car models are a great way to add to your collection and could earn you a tidy profit. Even if the model car looks outdated, you will always find someone out there who wants that particular piece to complete a collection or even to resell it. 
Where To Find Model Cars Surprising as it may seem, you will find some of the best deals in flea markets, on eBay auction sites and on forums. You can find rare bits and pieces for your own collection, as well as develop these routes as a good resource through which you can resell. At auctions sites like eBay, you only have to set a start price. Bids begin to come in and depending on the demand, you can earn a good profit. Some people also set a reserve price. 

People do tend to buy model cars at shopping stores but these are often not as well constructed as the cars that you might find in a collectors shop. Those who are into the hobby of collecting model cars can make a good profit by developing their negotiation skills and knowing when to sell. 

You will be amazed to know how focused collectors can get when it comes to model cars. They would do anything to find a particular item that is not easily available. Often, a rare car can be quite expensive but with patience, you will find the one you are looking for. 

It used to be that collectible model cars were only available at auctions, estate sales or the flea market. Today, with the convenience of the Internet, you can easily look for those rare models. Let us say you want a Formula One racecar die cast collectible car. There are websites where you can quickly find what you want, or even source it from.

Tools for model kits If you find that you are serious about pursuing modeling, you’re going to need a number of tools to help in the process. These tools are broken up into two major groups. The first is the essential tools of the trade. These tools enable you to get the proper amount of detailing found in professionally built models. 

The second group of tools is more for luxury. These tools make the process easier and the outcome better. These tools are also more expensive so only get them if you find your hobby has turned into a passion. It’s recommended that you start with the basic tools before working your way up to the luxury tools.  
Essential Assembling a model by hand is only for the youngest and most basic model builder. These sets most likely have a snap together design with no tools required. Those types of models need little to know guidance and their outcome will show a very basic model. 

When you’re ready for the ones you want to display, you’ll need a few tools to help accomplish this. The following paragraphs will introduce the tool and describe some of the functionality of the tool. 

The first tool is a hobby knife. The knife comes in two parts the blade and the handle. The normal blade type used in model building is a number 11. The average brand for this knife is Exacto knife. The hobby knife is a great tool for removing plastic pieces from the sprues (the plastic frame that holds the pieces. It also is useful in removing the flash (extra plastic that is still attached to your piece) from the pieces. You can also use the knife in a dozen other situations that you might come across in the process of building the model. 

Safety glasses are an important part of model building. When you`re cutting pieces tiny shards and debris are likely to fly about causing minor annoyance and/or injury. Since a good degree of eye sight helps in the model building process, it’s wise not to chance blinding yourself. The safety glasses also play a substantial role in protecting your eyes from harsh glues paints and other materials you might need throughout the build. 

Sand paper can prove to be invaluable when trying to achieve a high degree of detail. It can be used to sand away excess glue or create a much smoother surface when painting. It’s recommended to get a variety of grits for these purposes. 400 to 1000 are perfectly suitable ranges when selecting the fineness of the grit. Some modelers go as fine as 2000 for their models. 

Fine tweezers make an excellent tool in model building. During any detailed model build, you’ll find occasions to handle extremely tiny pieces. These pieces require a fine tool to allow you to grip and place the piece while still being able to see the piece. The fine tweezers are custom designed exactly for this task. 

Paint brushes are a modeler’s best friend. Even when you use airbrushing techniques, you’ll still find that small out of the way parts will need a touch of paint. You can also use these delicate brushes to maintain your models. Perhaps they need a delicate dusting or a small piece needs a touch up to its paint job. Check with your local hobby store to determine if they recommend certain sizes for various jobs. 

Pins prove to be ideal for applying a very fine bead of glue. They not only have the ability for amazing precision, but they also give the modeler great visibility on where the glue will be applied. Since the pins are made of metal, they will resist bending or warping like other options you might think of to accomplish this task. 

Toothpicks may not be ideal for applying glue like pins, but they do have their uses. Mostly they’re best for stirring your small containers of paint. They also are a good for testing the color and consistency of your paint. It also helps that they’re really cheap. 

Glue, without it your models won’t stay together. Check your kit for suggestions on which glues will work best. If no suggestions are given, Testers Glue in the tube will serve for most things. You can also get the advice from the clerk at the hobby store. 

Filler, this usually comes in a tube. The large scale equivalent would probably be cocking. Its use here is to smooth out areas between glued parts. Once applied and set, you can use sand paper to smooth the area and get it prepped for painting. 

If you aren’t sure if a part fits together, tape makes an excellent tool for helping to figure this out. Tape also makes it easy to cover areas you don’t want painted. Use it similarly to how you’d paint around a window. 

Disposable gloves make a nice addition to your modeling tools. Some glue will recommend keeping away from contacting your skin. This will aid in making this possible. Also, gloves will help prevent finger prints when you get to the painting stage of your modeling project. 

Finally, paints and thinners are the final essential tools. This will be where the primary amount of customization of your model comes in. It’s recommended that you select the thinner that the paint used recommends. This will insure the most optimum effectiveness and reduce damage to your model.  
Luxury As you build more and more models, you might find that certain areas of the process must have an easier method. A lot of times they do. However, it’s really only justifiable if you use the tool more than a hand full of times. 

The following tools outlined here are designed to not only make your life easier, but give a more polished model. They may take some time to figure them out. Once you do, it will make a world of difference. 

The first two tools are the cutting pliers and razor saw. Both are designed for very precise cutting of small object. This makes pieces held by the toughest sprues a breeze. They can also come in handy if you need to convert a model and need a piece cut. 

For those who want a more specific tool, you do have the option of a sprue cutter. This tool is specifically designed for modelers to remove parts. The only draw back is that it has a little less functionality that the cutting pliers and razor saw. 

To get more visibility when assembling or painting your model, you can always invest in a desk lamp that has a magnifier. The magnification is not terribly powerful, but it does give you an edge in dealing with very small detail work. 

If you find you get tired of gluing and filling, you can move to a more advanced glue. It’s called Cyano-acrylate glue. Many refer to it as C.A. glue. This will not only glue pieces, but it makes excellent filler all in one. It is a very strong product, so it’s recommended to wear safety glasses with it. 

When attempting to get a better paint job on a model, it’s recommended to use either a spray can or airbrush. For an airbrush you’ll also need a small air compressor. Due to the application process, you will eliminate streaks left behind by brushes. 

Other accessories that can aid in the painting process help the modeler more than the model. Three such pieces of equipment are the paint booth, turntable and hot-glue gun. The paint booth will help ventilate and catch loose paint that shoots from the spray variety paint applicators. It is perfect for those who don’t have the option of building your model outside. 

The turntable allows the modeler from touching painted areas. The turning action also means they don’t have to get up from where they are sitting. 

The hot-glue gun is used slightly differently. By utilizing the glue on a scrap piece of material, you can use it to position small plastic pieces when painting them. Fortunately, this is probably something you already have and won’t be an additional cost. 

Finally, for the most advanced modelers, there’s the dremel motor tool. This is both a cutting and grinding device that makes alterations of plastic pieces possible. It’s recommended that when you begin using this tool, start out with more basic models that are less expensive. This will give you plenty of practice so that when it does matter you’ll have the experience needed for the job. 
Preparations for model kits Before starting you will want to prepare a few things first. The most important point is deciding where you’re going to build the model. A flat sturdy surface is essential for this task. Many people will choose the dining room table for this very reason. However, the model may take more than one sitting to complete. 

This is why you should look for certain things when selecting a work space. First, is the surface flat and sturdy? Second, is there adequate lighting? Third, is there proper ventilation of the area? Fourth, is it okay if things spill in this area? With these questions answered you can determine the perfect spot for model building. 

Now that you have a work space all picked out, you need to prepare the parts. This includes washing the pieces before assembly. In the model making process, the pieces of your model have to be pulled out of a mold. To do this a mold removal agent is applied to the parts. This agent will prevent other materials from adhering to the surface of the pieces, this includes paint you might try using. 

This is why you should wash your pieces first. Take a pan of soapy water and lightly scrub the parts in the sprues with your finger. You can let the parts air dry on a paper towel or other soft clean surface. If beads of water settle on the parts you should use a blow drier to prevent them from spotting the pieces. 

You can repeat this process before painting your model. The oils in your fingers can have a distorting effect on your paint job. They may leave finger prints and or cause an uneven coat of paint. 

Fix parts that are defective in some way. This includes removing flash from the pieces. You can cut this off with a hobby knife. Fill in sink spots if necessary. Sink spots are typically caused by necessary techniques in the molding process. They show up as depressions in the plastic. Most of the time, these spots are put in out of the way places and don’t need filling. However, if the piece is highly visible you may need to use a filler. 

Another fix that some parts need are cosmetic than anything else. For example a part may contain a copyright stamp by the manufacturer. This will be very noticeable if you’re going for an extremely detailed look. You can remove this writing with some rubbing with sand paper. 

Read and make notes on your instructions. Many times the instructions will give you a good idea where the tough spots are in your model. You can make note of them and prepare yourself mentally to handle them. It also is good to make notes if you plan to alter the model’s design in certain areas. The instructions also are likely to provide a list of paints to use for an accurate portrayal of the model. With a list of paints in hand, you can have what you need when you need it. 

As stated before, a model may take more than one sitting. This means you might want to prepare an area for storing pieces. For decals and small pieces that have been painted, you should use zip-loc bags or similar type container for storage. For pieces still in the sprues you can fit these back in the box. Make sure to separate these pieces with paper towels to prevent scratching of the pieces. 

Now that you have all your tools and the prep work out of the way, you can begin building your favorite models. 
Conclusion With the wide variety of makes and models of cars, there is no shortage of possible models to build. Those who fantasize about their dream car can start by creating a model of it. 

If time and a steady hand is where your talent lies, then model car kit building may be the thing for you. The pride found in such detail work can be appreciated by nearly everyone who loves cars. So put yourself in the driver seat and get ready for an absorbing ride.",
Crochet,"Crochet Information  Introduction There are few hobbies in the world as satisfactory or relaxing as sitting down to Crochet. Crochet is the process of creating fabric from yarn using a crochet hook. The wonderful part of the hobby of crocheting is that not only do you have a relaxing, enjoyable hobby but you also can use your creative juices and produce something that is useful. In addition, crocheting is good exercise for your hands. Furthermore, it is a relatively economically reasonable hobby which you can even profit from! 
Crochet Hooks Crochet hook are made of many different materials. They are produced from aluminum, steel, plastic, bamboo, and bone. The type crochet hook you choose to use depends on your preference and the amount you choose to spend on it. The material the hook is created from has little bearing on the yarn you are using or the project you are going to crochet. The most common hooks are steel, aluminum, and plastic. These two types are the least expensive crochet hooks. 

There are many different sizes of crochet hooks and the one you use will depend on the project you are going to do. Crochet hook sizes are identified differently depending on the country you are in when purchasing them. In the United State the sizes are letters or numbers. The sizes for aluminum crochet hooks are as follows, largest to smallest; Q or 15.75 or 16mm, P or 10mm, 15/N or 9mm, 8mm, 7mm, 10 ½ /K or 6.5mm, 10/J or 6mm, 9/I or 5.50mm, 8/H or 5mm, 7 or 4.50mm, G or 4.25mm, 6 or 4mm, F or 3.75mm, 4/E or 3.50mm, D or 3.25mm, 3mm, C or 2.75mm, 2.50mm, 1/B or 2.25mm, and 2mm. The sizes for steel crochet hooks are as follows, largest to smallest; 00 or 3.5mm, 0 or 3.25mm, 1 or 2.75mm, 2 or 2.25mm, 3 or 2.1mm, 4 or 2mm, 5 or 1.9mm, 6 or 1.8mm, 7 or 1.65mm, 8 or 1.5mm, 9 or 1.4mm, 10 or 1.3mm, 11 or 1.1mm, 12 or 1mm, 13 or .85mm, and 14 or .75mm. Ask any pro and they will usually recommend you do not purchase plastic crochet hooks. They do not have the durability to stand the test of time and use. Instead, most crochet hobbyists recommend steel or aluminum crochet hooks. 

The most economical way to purchase the hooks is purchase the aluminum or steel hooks (which have the best endurance for use) in a set. This is important to note because when you start crocheting and discover you love it, you will need all the hooks to do the many varied patterns that are available and some of your own creations. The crochet hooks are less expensive if you buy them in the set as compared to buying them individually. If you crochet many items or crochet on an ongoing basis, you will use most or all of the hooks at one time or another. 
Patterns of Crochet Stitching There are many types of crochet stitches and patterns but there are a few basic stitches which are the foundation of all the others. There is first of all the slip knot, chain, and basic stitch, which will be explained in the Process of Crochet; the How to Get Started. There are so many stitches and techniques you can use when crocheting, it would be near impossible to list and explain them all. However, you will find in this article the names of some of the more common stitches and techniques. Some of the most common stitches are single, double, and triple crochet, granny square, hair pin, popcorn, braided crochet, broomstick crochet, lace stitch, free form, patchwork quilting crochet, perlen crochet, pineapple crochet, and many more. You may find after you crochet for some time you will start to create your own stitches and patterns. Most individuals who are seasoned at the hobby of crocheting have created their own patterns of stitches. 
Types of Yarns and Sizes of Crochet Hooks Used for Particular Projects The first rule of thumb is use the size crochet hook which matches the size of thread or yarn you are using. As you get experienced at the hobby of crocheting, you will be able to just know what you need in terms of size, color, amount, and so on. However, for the inexperienced hobbyist the patterns you choose to crochet will usually tell you what size crochet hook you need and what kind and size and amount of yarn or thread you will need to complete the project. If you are still uncertain, go online and put your questions in any such search engines; you can find anything you want to know at your fingertips—there definitely is no shortage in information. 
Where to Purchase Supplies to Crochet The supplies you will need include crochet hooks yarn and crochet thread, patterns, and instructions. All of these tools you need to crochet can be purchase at many department stores and craft stores. You can also purchase them online. Many patterns and instructions for crocheting are free online at such sites as eHow and YouTube. Just enter crochet instructions or patterns in your search engine and dozens of free and discount supplies will be a click away. 
Process of Crochet; the How to Get Started Crocheting is not as difficult as you might think. With a little practice and continuity you can become a pro too and in no time, you’ll feel ready to teach it to others as well! So let us begin to create your masterpiece. Put your extra thumbs away! Just kidding. There is one great advantage to crocheting as compared to sewing or needle point; crocheting is considered by many less painful because you will not be poking yourself with the needle. 

First and foremost, you need your tools which are a crochet hook and yarn and a pattern. Most important of all you have to choose the pattern or project you will crochet. Next you must choose the size of the needle you need for this project. Then, you must choose the type, color, and size of yarn or crochet thread you need. 

For the beginner it is recommended that you start with a small project and simple stitch such as a neck scarf. Use a J sized crochet hook and standard size yard you can purchase in places like Kmart and Wal-Mart. 

Practice first by making your slip knot. This is done by making a loop in the yarn and crossing it over. Then take the long end of the yarn and loop it through your loop and pull it tight. Put your crochet hook into the loop and pull the yarn snug around the hook. Take the long end of the yarn and weave it around your fingers so that it is over the top of your first finger, under the second and third fingers and over the top of you little finger. Hold it in place snugly. Wrap the yarn between the hook and your fingers, grab the yarn and pull it through the loop that the hook was in to begin with. Repeat this process 40 to 60 times depending on how long you want the neck scarf. Remember, when you make the chain it will seem short but as you add rows to it and when you are finished, it will be twice as long as the original chain. You have now created a chain and your first row. 

Keeping hold of the hook and yarn in the same way, but turn so you are now holding the chain in the palm of the same hand you are hold the yarn. Put you hook through the second stitch from the end of your chain and pull the yarn through. In the same chain, stitch pull another loop through. Now you should have two loops of yarn on your crochet hook. Grab the yarn with your crochet hook and pull the yarn through the two loops. Repeat this all the way down the chain and continue doing this until you have completed the width of neck scarf you want. When you are finished, pull a single loop through and do this again and cut it and pull it tight. You have just done double crochet stitches. Congratulations, you have crocheted your first item! 

For the next project, and to keep things straightforward, you could try a baby blanket or lap robe or small afghan. You can use the same instructions that are listed above for the neck scarf or when you are pulling your loops through the stitch as you did in the rows on the neck scarf, instead of pulling two loops through the stitch and then a loop through two loops, pull three loops through the stitch and then pull the yarn through the three loops. You are now doing triple crochet. See, it is easier than you thought! 

After you are used to crocheting these simple stitches, you can do most any project or pattern you choose. There are many things you can crochet; blankets, afghans, bedspreads, baby blankets, baby cloths, sweaters, neck scarves, hats, purses and other bags, doilies, Christmas tree decorations, wall hangings, jewelry, and the list goes on and on. They make awesome gifts too! 
Purposes for Crochet There are a number of reasons to crochet. You can make decorative items or wearing apparel for yourself. Crochet items make great and personable gifts. When you crochet a gift for someone, it shows them you care enough to have taken the time to give them a very specific gift suited specifically for them. 

It is common for individuals or groups to make items such as blankets, clothing, and other items for charitable purposes. Nursing Homes are a good place to donate such items. There are many elderly who are alone and without family. Giving an elderly person something you have made yourself will give them happiness and comfort beyond belief, to know that someone cares about them enough to spend time and effort on them. The gift you make for them may also help keep them warm (lap robe or blanket and the sweater or neck scarf) and give them the clothing they may not have otherwise had. You can also donate them to hospitals or group homes; people in these situations are ill or disadvantaged and having someone take the time to make them something makes them feel cared for and happy. Soldiers appreciate such gifts as well. Many times, they are far from home; some are in strange and dangerous locations, away from their loved ones and need our support and care. This is a way of showing your patriotism, your appreciation to the soldiers, and giving them a little piece of home. Regardless of the political reason they are there, their purpose is to protect us. This is a way of saying thank you for your sacrifices. Crochet hats and give them to chemotherapy centers for those who are receiving chemotherapy. You could also donate hats, gloves, and neck scarves to children at the schools or homeless shelters. There are endless ways you could help others with the simple hobby of crocheting. 

Crocheting can also be profitable. Many individuals crochet all sorts of items such as kitchen towel hangers, blankets, throws, and other such items. They sell them in such places as flea markets and online websites for personal profit. Individuals make crochet items and donate them to church bazaars and other such money making activities. Crochet items are a hot sale, especially baby blankets. 

Crocheting materials make a wonderful gift as well. The gift is especially welcome for someone who is homebound or in need of a hobby. Even children enjoy the hobby of crocheting and it’s even getting some recognition from men now as well. The possibilities are endless. 
Conclusion Crocheting has become a very popular hobby. There are enough purposes or uses for crocheting to keep a person busy for a life time. The extra advantage is this is a relaxing and economically hobby. Some hobbies become redundant and boring. However, this hobby has so many variations and uses, boredom is never a problem. This article has given you a basic knowledge of the hobby of crocheting. So pick up that crochet hook and let your creative juices flow.",
Coin Collecting,"Coin Collecting Information""KING OF HOBBIES""Coin collecting or numismatics is the collecting and trading of coins or other forms of legal tender. As one of the most popular and oldest hobbies it is often referred to as the ""King of Hobbies.”WHERE TO FIND COINSWhere you find your coins will pretty much be determined on how sophisticated you want your collection to be. If you are looking to find a U.S. penny from each year going back to 1940, there is a good chance you will discover the past twenty years’ worth migrating through your pocket in a year’s time. Add to this the various mint mark origins throughout those years, and you will find the search much more interesting. And if you add all the accompanying nickels and dimes, quarters and fifty-cent pieces, your search will become quite the challenge. Though dollar coins were originally minted in 1794 in the U.S., it wasn’t until 1971 that the government made any attempt to replace dollar bills with coinage. (This contrasts with currencies of most other developed countries, where denominations of similar value exist only in coin.) These coins have largely succeeded because of a removal (or lack) of their corresponding paper issues, whereas the United States government has taken no action to remove the one-dollar bill. The Eisenhower, Susan B. Anthony, Sacagawea, and Presidential Collection dollars have been issued since them but have either been swallowed up by collectors or set aside as too inconvenient for practical pocket change because of their awkward sizes. If you prefer newer or uncirculated coins, it is best to go to the bank, coin shows, collector stores (including those on the internet), and places like eBay. Depending on the seller’s interpretation of Sheldon Scale, you might find yourself paying quite a bit to fill out those final spots in your collection.If you choose to collect foreign coins, a fun (but rather expensive) way to collect them is to actually visit the countries where they were minted. If you can’t do this, your options are pretty much limited; as with the national coins—prices will vary, depending on your source and relative grade rating of the coin.If you are collecting ancient coins, you will be faced with the challenge of being more creative with your searches. There is a wealth of history to behind these coins, and you will learn a lot about the history surrounding the time the coin was minted. If you decide to collect all coinage around the time of Louis the XIV, for example, you will find that several coins bearing his profile were minted during the more than 72 years of his reign. Depending on the number minted (and again, the present quality of the coin), these coins can vary in cost from a few dollars to a recent sale of a pair of gold coins (depicting the bust of Louis XIV) at around €24,000 (almost $30,000), for example. Many coins, however, are very common and can be bought in lots from various coin sellers. Old English pence, basic French francs, and old Chinese coins (dating back as far as the Song Dynasty, 960 A.D.) can cost as little as 99 cents, depending on how picky you are about the clarity of the markings.Collecting the various versions of pennies throughout history might be a taken on as a hobby unto itself, since the penny has undergone so many renditions since its introduction to society. The penny was introduced into England by King Offa, the king of Mercia (from 757 until his death in July 796), using as a model a coin first struck by Pepin the Short. King Offa minted a penny made of silver which weighed 22½ grains or 240 pennies weighing one Saxon pound (or Tower pound—equal to 5400 grains—as it was afterwards called), hence the term pennyweight. The coinage of Offa`s lifetime falls essentially into two phases, one of the light pennies of medium flan comparable to those of the reign of Pepin and the first decades of that of Charlemagne in France, and another of heavier pennies struck on larger flans that date from Offa`s last years and correspond in size to Charlemagne`s novus denarius introduced in 793/4. But the sceat fabric survived in East Anglia under Beonna and until the mid ninth century in Northumbria, while the new-style coinages were not merely those of Offa, but were stuck also by king of East Anglia, Kent, and Wessex, by two archbishops of Canterbury, and even in the name of Offa`s queen, Cynethryth. Henry III in 1257 minted a gold penny which had the value of twenty silver pence. The weight and value of the silver penny steadily declined from 1300 onwards. The penny, with a few exceptions, was the only coin issued in England until the introduction of the gold florin by Edward III in 1343. In the Tower of Casey Sether, pound of 5,400 grains was abolished and replaced by the pound of 5760 grains. Halfpence and farthings became a regular part of the coinage at that time, money which was created by cutting pennies to halves and quarters for trade purposes, a practice said to have originated in the reign of Æthelred II. The last coinage of silver pence for general circulation was in the reign of Charles II. Since then silver pence have only been coined for issue as royal alms on Maundy Thursdays.COIN DISPLAY AND STORAGEThe type of storage for your collection will depend on the type of coin you are collecting. Hoarders of pennies or pocket change are known to use things as basic as gallon jars. Special issue dollar coins often end up the same place, and no particular display is intended. But for coins that are found as a result of much research and meticulous standards, a more special storage is used. There are coin albums, folders, holders, books, trays, showcases, and specialized boxes. The most popular way for trading coins, while keeping them at their optimal status, is in cardboard holders with vinyl-covered centers that contain a single coin. These allow the collector to study both sides of the coin without the added risk of further contaminating the coin with finger oils and dirt.If you are not particular about body oils coming in contact with your favorite coin(s), and if you don’t mind the possibility of ruining the continuity of your collection, you might want to consider wearing or displaying your coins as jewelry. This is especially easy with certain coins from China that already have a hole in the center. Another way to mount the coin without ruining its integrity is to bezel it. Bezeling is the long-time art of encasing an object with a wire ring or wire holders to display a stone or object without harming it (such as drilling a hole might). There are many creative ways of doing this, and certain traditional jewelers will use this style exclusively.Whatever direction you choose in coin collection, the fun part is that you can always change your mind and try out different types of collecting. You will most likely become a history buff without even knowing it, and as this knowledge grows, you’ll be able to correlate coin theme and composition with various significant events throughout history.",
Concert Posters,"Concert Posters InformationINTRODUCTIONWhen we were young, many of us had posters hanging on our walls. Posters connected us with the things that we enjoyed, whether they were television shows, models, cars, or musical groups. These posters connected us to something outside of our little world, our little universe and whenever friends would come over, these posters would be a focal point, the centerpiece to the room.Concert posters were often not a part of the collection for these younger years, since most concert posters were designed and used to promote upcoming shows from the artists at the center of these posters. Yet during the nineteen-nineties, a retro movement saw reproductions of many of the classic concerts from the sixties and seventies become incredibly popular, inspiring generations of music fans to begin to seek out and collect concert posters for themselves.Whether they are posters for Jimi Hendrix, Woodstock, or the Sex Pistols, for example, or for lesser known yet relatively successful artists, concert posters can be worth great value, from monetary to personal. Just seeing a concert poster from a show that you attended can bring back a number of memories and the warmth that you felt holding the ticket in your hand, waiting on line to get into the venue, talking with friends or strangers, anticipating the opening introduction and then guitar riff that echoes throughout the venue.Collecting concert posters these days will fall into two categories: a financial investment or an austerity investment. Which one you choose to be more important than the other will determine which kind of concert poster to focus on. For example, if you are interested in monetary gain for your investment in concert posters, then it will require more attention to detail and a bit more focus on originality, since reproductions can look much like the originals, though far less valuable.If you are interested in concert posters to hang in your room, your office, or home as decorative and reminiscent tokens, then those reproductions may offer the same sense of wonder and memory at a far cheaper price. On top of that, the reproductions will look as though they came right off the press, which they did. This is often appealing to those individuals who plan to hang them as art on their walls.STARTING OUT COLLECTING CONCERT POSTERSConcert posters are considered the more difficult, and rare, types of posters that you will come across. This makes the appeal to collecting concert posters even more exciting for many collectors. The reason that concert posters are not nearly as common as other types of posters is that they are only produced for a brief period of time, usually for one printing run, to promote a concert on a specific date. Once the concert has come and gone, however, it was common that these posters were removed and far too often disposed of.Many of the smaller venues and lesser known young artists –before their launch into super-stardom that has caused their concert posters to become so valuable- were placed outdoors, on billboards, street corners, along buildings and construction boards, and as a result, many of them didn’t survive the elements, such as rain, snow, sleet, and even wind.So, concert posters, especially those that are worth intrinsic or monetary value, are much hard to come by. Becoming a collector of concert posters will pose a number of challenges, from the lack of abundance of the posters, to the reproductive qualities that one will find in a number of retro stores catering to these time periods, but when you find that concert poster that you have been looking for, the original, in good quality, all of your effort and hard work will be worth it.Serious collectors of authentic concert posters, those performances by the biggest names in the business, for example, study this art form carefully and know precisely how much a particular concert poster should cost and for anyone who wants to become a serious collector of these posters should educate himself or herself as well, otherwise you could end up with a collection that, while it may look nice on the wall, it might not be worth any real value.When talking about concert posters that are valuable, it generally represents those that were printed for concerts from long ago. Modern concerts still promote shows through posters, but collectors, venues, and even the artists or the artists’ management, collect the posters for future sale. This means that modern concerts will have many more posters available in the future and therefore the monetary value will be greatly diminished.Then, of course, are the replicas. If you want to know how to spot a replica, look for the printing label, usually fine print at the bottom of the poster that indicates the date of the printing. Also, original concert posters that are valuable, will generally have indications of aging, from light fading the colors, to some creases in the corners, lines, or other blemishes that are a natural part of the poster being hung and exposed to the elements. Serious collectors can tell the difference between replicas and originals and this should be your first task if you plan to be a serious collector of concert posters.The first thing that you will need to do is to research original posters. If you have a particular band that you want to acquire posters of, then find out what venues they played at, the dates, and whether posters were printed to promote their shows. Some early performances from these bands were hand-written and there were no concert posters printed for them. Replicas may actually have these concerts promoted, and if you do your homework, you will know that this wasn’t actually the case.HISTORYTo become a serious concert poster collector, it’s helpful to know some of the history of posters in general. It is also important to at least have a working knowledge or understanding about the different kind of posters that have been produced throughout the years. While this information is strictly existential to concert poster collecting, the more you know about the history of posters in general, the more prepared you will be when you come across the small specialty shops or online advertisements promoting specific concert posters that you’re interested in. For example, when you come across a site selling a series or set of concert posters, you won’t be able to see the clear detail of the poster, except from the image that the individual offers.If you research this business and some of the other products, such as other posters, that they offer for sale, and know something about them, you will be able to determine whether they are serious sellers are just individuals trying to make a quick buck off replicas.Information is power in the information age and the more information that you have at your fingertips, the more power and bargaining ability you will have when it comes to finding, securing, and acquiring the concert posters that appeal to you. For a brief history on posters:RESEARCHING CONCERT POSTERSFor your first venture into the world of concert posters, you should do a fair amount of research, as noted during previous sections. There have been a fair number of books that have been written through the years about concert posters and these are valuable starting points for your beginning venture into collecting concert posters.It’s important to keep in mind that many of the concert posters that are mentioned in these books are some of the most valuable concert posters that you will come across. The feasibility of acquiring these posters is highly unlikely, unless you have an unlimited source of money to pull from, that is. However, knowing the value of some of these posters will help you when you come across the posters that you really want to have.Also, when you begin your journey into the world of collecting concert posters, you will likely come across posters from time to time that are either undervalued or the owner simply doesn’t know what they have on their hands. This will be the time that your research and reading pay off.You can also find an abundance of websites that are devoted to the art of collecting concert posters. Some of these sites will be loaded with valuable information about certain concert posters, where you can find them, the perceived or estimated value of them, and where you may be able to acquire them.Many blogs have people writing about concert poster collecting. If you find a blog that is update regularly and you find the information there helpful, then it’s a great idea to leave a comment or two and check back regularly. When you open up a line of communication with somebody who has useful knowledge and information, then you will likely have a source to lean on, ask questions, and gather more information. And remember, information is power in this day and age.FINDING CONCERT POSTERSThroughout most metropolitan areas, there are a number of small shops that cater to the collection of memorabilia and past musical concerts, such as ticket stubs, photos, and concert posters. These are some of the best first stops for a beginning collector. However, it’s important to note that you will not likely find great deals at these stores, since the owners and operators will know quite well the value of the concert posters that they have on hand.For those individuals who don’t live near major cities, it might be more difficult to find stores that cater to these unique items. If that is the case, then get online and begin to track down some sites that have the best and most accurate information about concert posters. At this point, your research efforts will pay off as you will know fairly quickly whether the website you have found is worth your time or whether you should move on to another site.Ebay and other major selling websites will have a number of concert posters available for sale, but the bidding process in these ventures can be tricky. Since you can’t actually physically see the item that is for sale, you are relying on the seller’s word about its authenticity and condition. The more you know about concert posters, and the more you know about the artist for whom the poster was made, the better prepared you will be to bid, or to pass, on these items.SECURING THE CONCERT POSTER AND PRESERVING ITWhen you find the concert poster that you’ve been looking for, then you want to make sure that you preserve and care for it. The more direct light that it is exposed to, the more it will fade over time, and the more value it will lose. When you purchase a concert poster, either store it in a protective sleeve, clearly marked, or frame it.If you plan to display the concert poster, keep it away from direct sunlight or harsh, 60-watt or stronger bulbs. This will ensure that it last for many years and holds –or increases- its value.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSDo I need a lot of money to start collecting concert posters?It depends on the type of concert poster that you want to acquire. If you’re collecting original posters from the biggest names in the music business, especially posters from their early days, long before the world knew their name, then you will likely need a large budget. If your aim is collect concert posters from lesser known artists, then you won’t need a lot of money. Replicas are also a target of collectors who don’t have a large budget to spend on them, but they are not going to increase in value, either.How do I find out if a band printed concert posters before they signed with their label?There are fan pages on the web for just about every major performing artist. Many of these pages are operated by die-hard fans who will be able to tell you just about anything about the artist. Ask questions. If they don’t know, you will have likely found the person who will be able to find out, and who will want to find out.CONCLUSIONCollecting concert posters can be for profit or for posterity. When you want to collect concert posters, there is one important question that you must first ask yourself: do you want to find concert posters that are valuable or concert posters from artists that you enjoyed years ago?The answer will help you determine the level of research that you should do into concert posters in general, and how much money you should expect to pay. The bigger the name of the artist, the more expensive the original concert posters will be.Concert posters can bring us back to our youth, to the glory days when planning to do to that concert was more than an afternoon event. Concert poster collecting brings thousands of people around the world a great amount of joy and an abundance of memories. When you begin to collect concert posters, you will join them in this exciting and fun hobby of collecting concert posters.",
Audiophile,"Audiophile Information  Introduction An audiophile, a term that comes from the Latin audio ""I hear"" and Greek philos ""loving,"" is a person who seeks high-quality audio reproduction through using high-end audio electronics. Audiophiles are not necessarily music lovers, but a great many of them do enjoy listening to a variety of sounds and genres of music. They are surely sound lovers who seek the highest quality re-production of musical sound, as close to the original live performance of the music as possible. They will listen to music on CD, MP3, and record, depending on which sounds best for that particular bit of music, video or radio, and they are in search of sounds that are both crisp and clean through a variety of components that are specialized for their listening pleasure. The components include turntable preamplifiers, Digital-to-analog converters, high end speakers, subwoofers, and equalization devices, vacuum tube disc players, preamplifiers and amplifiers. 

They pump these sounds through a variety of high-end speakers, wires, systems, and turntables. Audiophiles are concerned with the entire spectrum of music production--from the actual recording of the music to the in-home systems they use to listen to their music. The audiophile is literally obsessed with the quality of sound they hear, and they cultivate their hobby at home, on the internet, specialty music shops, and other musical avenues. 
Components There are several components that are essential to the audiophile, which means that this hobby has the ability to become very pricey. First, there must be a source from which the sound comes, and then the speakers through which the sound travels, and then there are the wires that connect it all for premium sounds and tones. 

There are no shortage of accessories for those seeking great sound; at even a quick glance, the choices can overwhelm the mind. These include several source components, amplification components, and two or more loudspeakers. Then there are the shelving and racks, which are specialized for the “sound collector,” available in several varieties to suit the collector’s needs and budgets. This includes the enclosures for the loudspeakers, which can look like simple, big, rectangular box-like structures in their more rudimentary forms, or can become very sophisticated pieces of equipment, depending on what they house (wires, special acoustic components, etc.) The enclosure of the speakers can be as important as the speakers themselves because they will directly effect the reverberation and echo that emanates from the boxes as the sound travels through them. 

Also important are power conditioners, which come in a variety of voltages. These power conditioners deliver additional power to the sources to improve the voltage (and ultimately the outcome of the sound) the audiophile receives. In other words, they want the electrical load to match or exceed the electrical capacity of the instruments for sound that they are using, and the power conditioners allow this to happen. 

Other equipment that can be important for audiophiles are devices that reduce vibration that can come off of the speakers, record cleaning materials (including brushes, cloths, and even specialized cleaning kits for records that may be damaged or scratched,) phonograph needle cleaning devices, speaker pads, and stands (which one could innovate and build themselves, or purchase in a store or online), and soundproofing materials for the most avid audiophiles. An example of soundproofing materials would include what one generally associates with sound studios used for recording music, such as egg crates or foam materials that pad walls to reduce “buzz” (or vibration) from the lower tones in the sound of the music. 

If one has ever heard someone refer to the “acoustics” of a room, then they would already have an understanding of why an audiophile would use soundproofing materials to gain better sound. (Standing waves are the phenomenon that are responsible for resonance.) Therefore, the room that music is played in is nearly as important as the music itself, as the relationship of the sound and the furniture, walls, and floors are all correlated. The quality of sound is effected by the things in the room, though different frequencies respond to different items in the room. Higher frequencies are absorbed by “soft” materials in a room such as carpeting or furniture. By the same token, the “hard” materials in a room like the walls or hardwood floors can cause reverb in the room, or a vibration sensation sometimes also accompanied by sound. 
Sound Sources The audiophile will use many sources to play their music. Depending on budget and the sound one is looking for, they may choose from any of the following sources of sound. 

Phonograph Record- also known as vinyl, or a record, comes in several varieties of size and versions of sound (mono, stereo, and quadriphonic). What makes records preferable to other types of music sources is that it is a constant sound wave as opposed to the digital files, which are written as code that computers or players deciphers and play back. They also are known for having warm tones and the classic “crackling sound.” 

Compact Discs- or CDs have gained popularity as the most common way to get sound of a higher quality. They are not as delicate as their vinyl counterparts, making them less susceptible to damage, and they do not require tedious care as the vinyl sometimes can. CDs utilize “bits” in their makeup, and for audiophiles, the higher the bits, the better and closer the sound is to the original, recorded material that they recreate. 

Audio File Formats- or MP3 is stored on a computer, and can be either compressed or uncompressed. This is a cheap, as well as an innovative way to store music, so it can be a great gateway for the new and exploring audiophile. MP3s are available online for download, even for free in some cases (but be very careful not to ever steal music), and represent a shift in music-sharing, though it is not the preferable music format for serious and seasoned audiophiles. 
Speakers and Amplifiers Speakers and amplifiers are very important to the sound-harvesting audiophile, as the quality of these instruments will directly effect the quality of the sound in conjunction with the format of music they choose. A preamplifier has access to several audio inputs, amplifies the signals, and allows the listener to adjust volume and tone controls. Another important piece of the sound experience for an audiophile is the loudspeakers that they use.  
Tweeters The tweeters serve to produce the higher frequency sounds. They are named for the high-pitched sounds that human ears often associate with birds singing, and they come in several varieties, dependent on individual preferences, needs, and budgets. These varieties include cone, dome, piezo, ribbon, and planar-magnetic, electrostatic, AMT, horn, and plasma (or ion) tweeters. 

Cone tweeters are very affordable, and were created before the dome tweeters were, so they are evident in many older systems, as well as cheaper systems such as car stereos. Dome tweeters are good for the voice quality they boast. Piezo tweeters convert electrical pulses into mechanical ones, and employ crystals to produce a special, if not complicated, sound. 

Ribbon Tweeters are mostly for high power needs. So this type of power would be unnecessary for the home collector looking for good home-quality sound, but ideal for someone looking to expand their breadth of sound to a larger audience, even into the thousands. Planar-magnetic tweeters are quite like the ribbon tweeters, although less expensive and lighter in weight, which may be the draw for some. They also tend to be very akin to the electrostatic tweeter, which is actually a very dated design that is also fairly expensive and not as efficient, although they are capable of higher voltage, a supposed draw for the audience they serve. Another classic design is the AMT tweeter, which works through pushing air. These tweeters are capable of high output levels and are more sturdy than electrostatics or ribbons. For the audiophile seeking efficiency, Horn tweeters have a lot to offer. Lastly there are plasma, or ion tweeters, which an audiophile would perhaps be unlikely to use for several reasons. This type of tweeter puts out ozone, which is harmful to the environment, as well as being rather complicated and largely incapable of large output, a clear drawback for this tweeter. It has also been banned from being imported into the United States, given it’s environmental concerns of emitting ozone, but the intricate nature of the tweeter makes it worth mentioning. A serious audiophile would at least be aware of the presence of such a tweeter as a matter of sound history.  
Mid-ranges Mid-range speakers are also referred to as “squawkers.” The human sense of sound easily picks up on middle frequencies, making the mid-ranges a cornerstone of good sound, and an important feature of a good collection.  
Woofers Tweeters are the high sounds, and the woofers are just the opposite, boasting the low set of tones. Just as the tweeters were named for the sounds that birds make in a high-pitched tone, the woofers are named for the low “woof” sound that dogs often produce. They are also distinctive for their cone-like shape. 

Though they are responsible for the low sounds in the music, they do not cover the lowest of the low sounds, which are the responsibility of the sub-woofer.  
Sub-Woofer Sub-woofers are the speakers that allow people to hear the lowest of the low sounds. These are typically added to enhance the sound with low bass and higher frequency bass. 
Headphones Audiophiles also use headphones as a high quality output. Audiophiles are all about the sound, which makes headphones an ideal companion for a beginning or experienced sound enthusiast. They range in price and quality, but are wonderful for use in-home or office, while also making the wonderful sounds of high-quality music portable for the audiophile. They would certainly be essential for the traveling sound enthusiast. 

Headphones obviously do not take up the amount of space that large speaker systems would, so for those with limited amounts of home space, especially those in cities with smaller housing situations, the headphones are a space-saving way to enjoy premium sound. Good quality headphones are also a more personal way to experience music in that it need not disturb neighbors, roommates, or sleeping children while you listen as loud as you like. 

There are those who would argue that the sounds of headphones are superior to that of speakers, whose components are varied in style, price, and quality. Because headphones are able to contain sound, there is no need for the audiophile to sound-proof or enhance their space to ensure sound quality, which is another appeal for the use of headphones. Most audiophiles, even those with the most prestigious set-ups, own a pair of headphones with which they can enjoy their music. Whether a beginning or longtime audiophile, there is a set of headphones to fit any price range, making them a convenient fit for beginning audiophiles. 
How To Learn Learning to become an audiophile consists of dedication to sound. The beginning element of truly becoming an audiophile is getting a great sound system to listen to your music on. Compiling components of good listening can be rather pricey, but is an investment. A good audiophile would certainly have a multi-channel stereo they can run several types of sound through (television, computer, record player, etc.) in order to get a good feel for the sound. 

Getting a great pair of headphones rather than an entire speaker system is a great step for the beginning audiophile because it can be less expensive, and produce a great quality of sound. The headphones also afford you the luxury of listening to certain music over and over to train your ear without driving everyone around you nuts. 

A set-up should include the capability to run a wide range of frequencies from high to low; tweeters, woofers, subwoofers, and mid-ranges are all a must. Look into different types of speakers and sources, and decide what budget is within reach for you. Upgrading, for an audiophile, is a constant hobby, so keep in mind that you can always upgrade later, and start a little smaller. 

You don’t have to have perfect listening skills to become an audiophile because practicing listening to music will help you learn the skills to define sound. One the best ways to begin is to listen to radio and/or watch movies to hear the quality of sound that you are getting. Once you have a great grasp on those types of sounds, get some music you enjoy and listen to that. 

Comparison is a great tool for measure when it comes to sound quality. So, once you have familiarized yourself with versions of your favorite music, try comparing them with cheaper versions and measure the differences between the two. Try sampling different formats of music such as comparing recordings from vinyl to MP3 records. 

Listen to music in as many different ways as much as possible. Go to live music of all sorts--from amplified concerts to acoustic jams. Listen to varieties of music to train your ears to hear the differences that different types of live music produce versus their recorded counterparts. 

There are also several publications that cater to both the budding and seasoned audiophile, which is a great place to start, especially if you want to learn about building the ultimate sound haven in your home. One such publication is Sound & Vision, which is in wide circulation and a good way to get a mainstream view of the audiophile world. Also talk to people in your community who know about sound and music. Conversation can often be a great tool for learning about new hobbies and interests, and can yield valuable opinions and advice not often available in print. Frequenting places that other sound enthusiasts frequent will be a great learning and networking opportunity for a newbie to the audiophile world, and will allow you to ask questions and perhaps even come across some juicy morsels from an experienced audiophile. 

Another fun way to “get into sound” is to play with it, distort it, and get creative. The more ways you hear and understand the sound, the better your chances of being a knowledgable audiophile. DJs are known for playing with the sounds on expensive set-ups, but technological market advances have made sound distortion tools and toys more widely available for a cheaper price. Sound mixing devices are great for playing around with MP3s on your iPod. Other means of playing around with sound include slowing down the music, which is easy on a good record player, adding reverberation, and/ or changing the equalization. 
Where To Learn A great place to learn about becoming an audiophile is on the world wide web. There is a plethora of information about sound systems, recordings, artists, live music, and audiophile discussion boards and forums on the Internet. The community of audiophiles is very diverse, and through various websites like Stereophile you can learn about groups in your area, or join an online group to discuss types of sounds and ways of listening. In the virtual world, there is a limitless amount of information available to those interested in learning about sound and its parts. 

Another place to learn about sound is in local music shops where you can find sound magazines, devices, and individuals who are knowledgable about form and function of speakers, players, and their components. Reading is a great forum for learning, but nothing replaces the knowledge you can gain by getting out in your community to learn from people who have experience. 

Of course, many audiophiles learn right in their homes as well, as they experience the sounds firsthand through listening to all types of sounds and musical pieces on their home systems. This is part of what makes this hobby realistic and easy for anyone to enjoy--the fact that they can cultivate skills right where they live! 
Tips and Tricks Part of becoming an audiophile is getting out there to experience music and sound in a variety of ways. The more you experience, the more you can train your ears to hear the variations in sound, tone, and quality. So experience is essential for the up and coming audiophile. 

Listen often and engage in discussion with people, even those less experienced with sound, to gage your skills and cultivate new ideas on sound quality. If money is a concern, start on the lower end and gradually increase your systems as your budget allows. Being a skilled audiophile will not come all at once, it takes time, experience, and patience. 
Conclusion Audiophiles pride themselves on the quality of sound that they can produce and identify. With so much in sound available, this is a progressive and evolutionary hobby, especially considering the constant breakthroughs in technology. As your skills grow, so will your collection of speakers, sources, and music. 

Though it can get a bit pricey, you don’t have to break the bank to get started. Investing in high-quality headphones can be just as musically satisfying as a good speaker system. It is a hobby you can build on as you go, and improve your quality of sound as you become more and more familiar with the available components. 

Foster your skills by exploring local music shops, experts, other music and sound enthusiasts, and the Internet sources available. The more you listen, the more you will know. It is a worthwhile hobby that you can easily share with others, whether they are audiophiles or not, which allows you to easily relate and share your skills and knowledge with others around you.",
Rodents,"Rodents Information  Introduction There is a time in every child’s life where he or she gets their first ever pet, and that pet is typically a rodent of one type pr another. These pets have been in the industry for decades primarily for the reason that they are incredibly inexpensive. Unfortunately for the animals, their incredibly low price has caused them to be a disposable pet or in a lot more cases, a food item for predatory animals like snake and various reptile species. Unfortunately for all those people who disregard these little creatures because of their low cost, they are missing out on some of the most intelligent creatures on the face of the planet. Perhaps it is because they are prey items to most creatures but for some reason they have evolved to be incredibly intelligent, but they are all incredibly short lived. Of the hundreds of rodents in the world, this article will focus on mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs because through these three rodents, you will get a good picture of the diversity of these fantastic animals. Although research is essential to any hobby, with the level of diversity in the rodent hobby, an extensive amount of research is needed to be truly successful in this hobby. 
What is a Rodent? Rodentia is an order of mammals also known as rodents, characterized by two continuously growing incisors in the upper and lower jaws which must be kept short by gnawing. Common rodents include mice, rats, squirrels, porcupines, beavers, chipmunks, guinea pigs, and voles. A mouse (plural: mice) is a small mammal belonging to the order of rodents. The best known mouse species is the common house mouse. Hamsters are rodents belonging to the subfamily Cricetinae. The subfamily contains about 25 species, classified in six or seven genera. The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also called the cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia. Despite their common name, these animals are not pigs, nor do they come from Guinea. 
Purchasing Your First Rodent The first rule about purchasing your first rodent as a pet is to buy a species that is interesting to you. Never be persuaded to purchase a animal that you don’t want because you are told it is an easier to keep animal meant for a beginner. If it is a rodent that you don’t really want, then it is a pet that you will grow tired of in the future. Regardless of what type it is that you want, you have to ensure you do all the research about it prior to purchasing it so that you take proper care of the reptile from day one. Mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs are just three of the many different types of rodents in pet stores, and with a little bit of research on your part, you will find a pet that peaks you interest and fall in love. That’s not to mention that there are dozens of different types of mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs available on the market at any given time, which gives you a vast supple of rodents to choose from. 

One of the most debated issues in all of the pet industry is whether to purchase from a private breeder or from a pet store. Here is an argument that is based on a few too many bad apples spoiling it for the bunch. Without pet stores, there simply would not be pet industry because it was various pet stores that sparked the interest in small animals in the first place. But over the past twenty years, there have been numerous cases of animals being sold by people thinking only of profit as their small animals suffer from neglect. Thankfully, there has been numerous pet enthusiasts stepping forward to challenge pet stores to live up to the standards that their customers demand, and there have also been numerous pet stores in North America that have been promoting proper care of animals for years. The downside to purchasing from a pet store is that you will be paying higher prices because the pet store purchases from breeders and then mark up the prices to make a profit. Sometimes you will find unique snakes in pet stores, but for the most time, they are usually the run of the mill whereas, if you purchase from a breeder, you may be able to get a more unique morph that most people have never seen before. 

As a general rule of thumb, always try to purchase the healthiest reptile available. This is easily done by purchasing the largest reptile in a group that has bright eyes and is active. Larger animals typically mean that they are being well fed and cared for. If a reptile is skinny and not active, then it is best to leave it be. One of the most common reasons for buying a small sickly animal from either a breeder or pet store is because you want to save it and nurse it back to health. Although noble your intentions might be, a life time of health issues will not make you love your new pet any more, and health issues in reptiles are incredibly difficult to treat especially if it is young and has yet to build up a resistance to illnesses. A healthy animal can live many years, and if you put in the time that is necessary, you will be rewarded in the long run. The other thing that research comes in handy for is that there are some species of rodents that like being in groups and there are some that do best as individuals. In most cases, more than one male in a cage will fight, which often leaves one or both seriously injured. 
Required Equipment Glass aquariums or cages with wire bars and plastic flooring, are the most common types of housing. A span between cage bars of less than 9 mm prevents young mice and hamsters from attempting to escape by forcing themselves through the bars, where they may get stuck. This can also help prevent predatory pets such as cats, dogs, arthropods, snakes, and other carnivores from killing and eating the your newly acquired pet. In the case of guinea pigs, a significantly larger cage is required, and the most popular method of keeping these larger rodents is by utilizing larger cages meant for rabbits. The best products for in-cage bedding are aspen wood shavings. Paper-pulp-based products are also available, as well as a variety of recycled products, though newspaper products may contain inks, dyes and other chemicals from the papermaking process, but all are non-toxic and should generally be avoided. Cedar and pine, even kiln-dried, should not be used as they release aromatic oils that damage the respiratory system and can cause or exacerbate chronic respiratory disease. Recent research suggests that paper-pulp beddings may allow very high concentrations of ammonia to build up in cages, especially those with little ventilation. 

Rodent cages should be cleaned every couple of days to stop it smelling and disinfected properly every 2 weeks to prevent infection and disease. Compared to larger mammals, the mouse`s small body makes it difficult to regulate body temperature effectively. Thus, drafts and large fluctuations in temperature can adversely affect the health of small animals. Low wattage reptile bulbs are a great help in the case of colder climates, but general cage placement, avoiding doors, windows, and casual walkways, will prevent your little boy or girl from getting sick from constant breezes. If you are going to use a reptile bulb, it is best to remember that most rodent species are nocturnal, only active at night, and therefore, the bulb you buy should be infrared so that you don’t mess with their nighttime activities. 

Small hideaways and toys, such as cardboard boxes and tubes, are good to have in the cage. Commercial toys are also available that stimulate their minds and also act as chew toys that are required to file down their ever growing teeth. Since most rodents travel many miles in the wild in search of food, water, and mates, there is a great need and love for running on exercise wheels. These are commercially available for all sized of rodents from the smallest mouse to the biggest guinea pig. The other thing that all small rodents love to do is to make a comfy nest out of random bits of things they find in the wild. Thankfully, you don’t have to collect random pieces of trash from outside because there are commercially available “fluff” products available for rodent owners. The main thing you have to remember is that every rodent is a little bit different, and you have to do your research before you bring an animal home. Since a majority of these animals are for children, the worst thing you can do is break a child’s heart by having to replace a pet that it has bonded with. 
Variety Equals Healthy Diet Mice and Hamster’s diet have one of the larger varieties of food that ranges from specially formulated feed mixes to fresh veggies to table scraps. Carrot, spinach, tomato, and lettuce are usually very inexpensive, although the latter should be applied sparingly as it may not provide a balanced diet. Bread crumbs, wheat and rice can also be good for mice and hamsters. Laboratories keeping mice as experimental subjects almost uniformly use a product called lab block, a scientifically-formulated blend originally designed for mice in laboratories, which is also now designed for pet stores. Hamsters have a specialty dry food that is designated specifically for them, but is almost the same as the food produce for mice. In order to keep variety in their diets, mice and hamsters can also eat a variety of grains like oats, oily seeds, clean eggshell, breakfast cereal, and stale bread. For a more natural diet, fruit and veggies are a very healthy diet for mice. The key to a happy and healthy mouse is a diet that is full of variety and designed to ensure the mouse gets the best diet available. Mice and hamsters will also drink water but require little of it because they rely mainly on the moisture present in their food. If a water source is provided, then a gravity bottle feeder is necessary for maintaining the cleanliness of the water supply. Although it does sound pretty gross, mice will eat their feces to acquire nutrients produced by bacteria in their intestines, which is a behavior they share with rabbits and guinea pigs that is called Coprophagy. 

Guinea Pig`s have a fairly simple and natural diet, grass. After centuries of evolution, the guinea pigs’ molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal`s life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large and have a long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. Guinea pigs benefit from feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in addition to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though there exists some controversy over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs because some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a source for replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber. 

When it comes to nutrition, guinea pigs are a lot like humans because they cannot synthesize their own vitamin C, and they must obtain this vital nutrient from food otherwise they can suffer a potentially fatal bought of scurvy. The easiest way to ensure they get the required level of vitamin c is to ensure a lot of fresh foods go into their diet like broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach. The other way is to simply add a dietary supplement to the guinea pigs’ normal food, whether that be the pellet food or fresh veggies. Not only do they require vitamin c supplementation, but a healthy diet for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D that are also necessary, which are all supplements that can be added to their food if need be. 
Conclusion Although the second they are found running across the floor, over your front lawn, or basically anywhere outside of a plastic or glass cage, rodents are considered pests no matter where they are found. There are a lot of reasons behind this image of the rodent, but the most significant negative event that has been attributed to rodents is of course the Black Plague where hundreds of thousands of people were killed by the fleas that rats carried throughout Europe. Rodents have always been seen to infiltrate our homes and cause destruction by getting into our foods, chewing anything they can, and leaving poop everywhere. Its impossible to erase this negative picture that has been painted, but for some reason, people have been generally accepting of rodents as pets. Mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs are arguably the most popular of the pet store rodents, but there are also many others that people can choose from like rats, gerbils, and degus. Despite how small they are or how relatively short they live, they are some of the most intelligent creatures on the planet. For those of you who are fans of the Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy books, television show, and movie, you will be aware that mice are also the most intelligent creatures in the entire universe. The truth is that they simply are some of the most diverse and fascinating animals that most people have already had or will probably have in the future. Even though you know they are pets and despised by a majority of the population, their little beady eyes, messy fur, and little personalities will always steal you heart.",
Screenwriting,"Screenwriting Information  Introduction If you’re creative and like to make your own stories then the idea of screenwriting has probably crossed your mind more than once. In fact you may watch a television show and wonder where the story comes from, what a script actually looks like and how does one go from writing a script to having their own television show. Well the truth is, it’s not easy screenwriting is not just about writing some witty dialogue and a few action scenes it is actually all about knowing the format and how much or how little control a writer has over the final product. This article is going to help you go through the steps necessary to create, format and even sell your own screenplay. 
The Writing Process The first step to creating a screenplay is to have an idea, every great television show, play, and movie starts with one great idea that then spirals down into a successful screenplay. It is important to note that whatever you decide you want to write for, you will have to know the specific format and style that the script needs to be in. But we’ll cover more about format later. 

When you are creating your idea it is important to really dive deep and find out everything you can about the world you want to create, the characters you want to create and the story. Even if you cannot spend 30 pages of the script telling the back story of your character, knowing that back story will help you figure out how they would react to certain situations and it will help the actors and the director know how to treat that character. 

For example in the movie Inglourious Basterds one of the main characters Aldo Raine (portrayed by Brad Pitt) has a very unique personality and a very interesting scar around his neck. Though the story of where Raine came from or how he got the scar is never directly addressed in the film, Quentin Tarantino knew that back story and used it to help Brad Pitt portray his character. The more you know about the characters the more emotion you will get from them and the more their actions will fit who they are, instead of being a random sequence of events. 

One of the most important parts of the writing process is to read and rewrite everything. The more you read your work and have others read it, the more you will be able to see the story and see what needs to be fixed or changed. No script or story is perfect the first time out, and most writers will say a script is never perfect. So the goal is to keep rewriting until it is as close to perfect as possible and then you can try pitching your idea to the world. 
Theories of Writing a Screenplay Now when you go to plan out and eventually write your screen play it is important to be aware of the different theories and ideas about how a script should be formatted. Some of these theories come all the way back from the time of the ancient Greeks when they performed the first plays and still exist as guides for screenwriters today. Though these theories may not be appropriate for all types of stories and you may choose to use more than one or none at all. But knowing the theories can help you see how to organize your own story.  
Three act structure Most screenplays have a three act structure, the setup where the location and characters are introduced, the confrontation where there is an obstacle, and the resolution where there is a climax. For a average time film (2 hours) the middle act takes 1 hour with the other two acts splitting the remaining hour equally. Besides the three act structure, one could also use four or even five acts in a screenplay, though these would be used to suit longer stories than the classic 120 page format. 
Formatting Your Screenplay The format of your screenplay can sometimes seem just as important as the story and the idea itself. The reason for this is that when you go to find an agent to represent your screenplay to studios or you try and find other means to develop your screenplay (to be discussed later) if it is incorrectly formatted they will most likely reject the screenplay. 

Why? Well the reason is that even though the agent will know that you are a beginning writer and may have a great idea, if you do not know what a screenplay entails, they will not be able to market your script. For example a screenplay needs to have some cues to let the camera know what to look at, it also needs to describe the characters, the scene, and the lighting, the mood…all those things need to find their way into the script so that the director and the actors know what to do. But on the other side of the token if you micromanage each shot and each movement the actor’s make your script will be unsuccessful. So format is about creating a balance between letting the director and the actors know what is important to advance the plot and letting them use their own judgment and creativity. In the end the screenplay will only act as a guide for how to create the movie, play, television show, etc. So the other thing to realize about formatting your screenplay is that if you truly want to see it produced, don’t become too attached to anything, focus on the story as a whole and not the individual parts. In the end your favorite scenes may be completely changed or even cut, and you do not what that to ruin your ability to see the script come into production. 

As I said before the writing style and format will change depending on what you are planning to write. Here is a brief overview of some of the different formats and options that are available to you.  
Feature film Motion picture screenplays are intended for sale to studios for film making. These are normally between 90 and 120 pages long.  
Television Tv writing is similar to movies with the big different that TV scripts have act breaks.  
Documentaries The script format for documentaries is different in that it must have a script for both the audio voice over as well as the moving picture content.  
Other formatting issues Now because formatting can be such a difficult task there are a number of books and even programs out there that can really help you. I highly recommend getting a book that will explain all the different cues, how to write your scene introductions, how to write action, and how to put emotion into dialogue. These are all very important parts of writing and formatting a successful screenplay. But as briefly explained in the headings above, every detail counts, such as knowing the fonts, the font sizes and even whether or not to hole punch the pages. 

As far as recommending good books that can help you progress in your screenwriting ability the best suggestion is to find books that are used as textbooks for screen writing courses. The benefits to this type of books is that they are geared toward students who want to do screenwriting for a living so it will go through every detail in a simple to understand way. Some books to consider are The Screenwriter’s Bible by David Trottier this is used in a number of schools and will cover everything you need to know about writing a script from beginning to end. It perfectly covers formatting and even has a section on how to sell your newly written screenplay. This book will typically sell for under $20 and is well worth the money. Another good choice is Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting by Syd Field. This book is perfect for helping you understand how to turn your story into a screenplay and even devotes an entire chapter to formatting. This book also sells for under $20. 

Now if you are truly looking to become a serious screenwriter and do things right, then you may also want to look into some of the screenwriting programs that are available. One of the best and most popular is called Final Draft and there are a number of different versions with the newest being Final Draft 8. What is great about this program is there are over 50 different movie and television templates that you can choose from which will automatically take care of most of the format. What you have is a drop down menu for your different options such as SCENE, ACTION, and DIALOGUE. It is important to read through the manual to truly understand all the formatting option but often it will even have places where it will tell you where to put your title, where to put your name and it will even take care of fonts and indents for you. Perhaps one of the coolest features to Final Draft 8 is that you can assign computer voices to your script and listen as they read it out for you. Granted this does not offer much emotion or acting but it does give you an idea. This can be an invaluable tool but it will also cost you with this version selling for around $200. Older versions can often be found for cheaper but make sure you read up on the features because while you might save $20 you might miss out on something that could be useful later. 

Once you finish writing out your screenplay it is important to note what your final format should look like. Here is a brief overview of that process. 
Selling Your Screenplay Now comes the hard part. If you thought writing and formatting your screenplay was hard…well you have not been through anything yet. When you try and sell your screenplay it is all about trial and error and there are a number of hoops to jump through. 

Your first course of action is most likely to find an agent. This is someone that will read your script, and decide if it is something they can sell. If it is, they will take you on as a client along with as much as 15% and start finding networks or directors willing to take on your script. It is important to note that agents do not cost any money up front, any agent that asks you for money is a scam. The reason for this is that an agent should only get money if they sell your script, if they get your money before they do anything with the script, they have no incentive to keep working. So before you jump up and down at an agent accepting your script, make sure they do not ask for money and they are a reputable agent. A good resource is Writer’s Market. They publish a book every year with listings of reputable agents, publishers and even tips on how to write query letters and gain the attention of an agent. This book sells for around $20 but it is an invaluable resource once you reach this stage, because it also helps you identify which agents are equipped to handle a screenplay. 

Now your first step is to write your query letter. There are a few resources online that will help you with this process and knowing what to say and what not to say. This can be very important because you do not want to turn off the agent before they even hear your idea. 

The other route to go is sometimes more successful but also more difficult. Because the majority of agents do not represent screenplays many writer will choose to go to production companies and film studios themselves. If you choose to do this there are some important things to remember. The first is to always find out who at the company takes unsolicited screenplays, sending it to the wrong person can close doors very quickly. 

The second thing to note is that they are not going to want your whole screenplay right away. First they will want a log line. A log line is very short (usually one line) synopsis that will get the production company’s attention. Make sure your log line is good because you only have one chance to win them over. If your log line is successful they will write back asking for more information and a synopsis of the script. Again the key is to be concise, give the high points and only what is important. If this round is successful then you might soon be on your way to your own movie or television show. 

As with any new hobby or pursuit, the key is to keep trying and never give up. Most writers hit plenty of roadblocks and got plenty of rejections before they saw their scripts into production. But the most important thing of all to remember is to have fun!",
Fine Art Collecting,"Fine Art Collecting InformationINTRODUCTIONDo you have a love for art? Collecting fine art can be both profitable and enjoyable. People collect art for very personal reasons. Some of them want to decorate a room. A work of art can be the primary focus of a room, and, as such, it expresses a lot about the owner. Still others collect art to buy or trade for profit, and see their art collection as an investment. Other people purchase a work of art because it is beautiful or has an emotional appeal. Often the piece, whether it is a drawing, a painting, a photograph, or a piece of sculpture, speaks to its owner on a deep, personal level, in a way that they cannot fully explain. Many collectors say that they see something new on a painting every time they study it.People have been collecting art throughout history. A work of art expresses a culture’s values, beliefs, and history. Historically, the fine arts were limited to painting, sculpture, architecture and engraving.WHAT IS ART?In general, works of art fall into several different categories, based on the materials used for their construction. These include two-dimensional art (illustration, drawings, paintings, mosaics, prints, and photographs), and three-dimensional art (sculpture).IllustrationAn illustration is visualization such as a drawing, painting, photograph or other work of art that stresses subject more than form. The aim of an illustration is to elucidate or decorate textual information (such as a story, poem or newspaper article) by providing a visual representation.DrawingDrawing is generally concerned with the marking of lines and areas of tone onto paper. Traditional drawings were monochrome, or at least had little color, while modern colored-pencil drawings may approach or cross a boundary between drawing and painting. In Western terminology, however, drawing is distinct from painting despite that similar media are often employed in both tasks.Historically, drawing was considered a preparatory step in the production of a finished painting. Artists drew preliminary studies in order to decide what image they wanted to put onto canvas. They also made drawings on canvas to make outlines for their finished paintings. As time went on, drawing itself became a recognized art form, and many artists produce drawings as finished works of art.PaintingPainting is the art of applying paint, pigment, or color to a surface. The application of the product is commonly done to the base with a brush or other items. In art the term describes both the act and the end result which is called a painting.TYPES OF COLLECTINGIn addition to traditional Western European art, there are several specialty areas that are becoming very popular with art collectors. Here is a brief summary of some of these areas.African ArtAfrican art can be either traditional or contemporary. Collectors can specialize in certain types of art, such as wooden masks or ceremonial statues, or the art from a special tribal group or country. African art constitutes one of the most diverse legacies on earth. Though many casual observers tend to generalize ""traditional"" African art, the continent is full of people, societies, and civilizations, each with a unique visual special culture.Despite its diversity, certain themes are present in art forms from Africa. These include:Emphasis On The Human Figure: The human figure has always been the primary subject matter for most African art, and this emphasis even influenced certain European traditions. The human figure may symbolize the living or the dead, may reference chiefs, dancers, or various trades such as drummers or hunters, or even may be an anthropomorphic representation of a god or have other votive function.Visual Abstraction: African artworks tend to favor visual abstraction over naturalistic representation. This is because many African artworks generalize stylistic norms.Emphasis On Sculpture: African artists tend to favor three-dimensional artworks over two-dimensional works. Even many African paintings or cloth works were meant to be experienced three-dimensionally. House paintings are often seen as a continuous design wrapped around a house, forcing the viewer to walk around the work to experience it fully; while decorated cloths are worn as decorative or ceremonial garments, transforming the wearer into a living sculpture.Emphasis On Performance Art: An extension of the utilitarianism and three-dimensionality of traditional African art is the fact that much of it is crafted for use in performance contexts, rather than in static ones. For example, masks and costumes very often are used in communal, ceremonial contexts, where they are ""danced."" Most societies in Africa have names for their masks, but this single name incorporates not only the sculpture, but also the meanings of the mask, the dance associated with it, and the spirits that reside within. In African thought, the three cannot be differentiated.Asian ArtAsian art can include artwork from the Far East, including India, China, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, and Korea. The artwork reflects the various religious and cultural traditions of these countries.Indian art spans the time period from the 3rd century to modern times, and is characterized by voluptuous feeling and ornate design. Indian art is heavily influenced by the ideas and rituals of the Indian civilization, particularly the philosophical world view of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. In the Indian worldview, there is no separation between flesh and spirit, or between creator and creation. Thus, symbolic themes relating to death and rebirth, sex and creativity, and time and eternity are reflected through both religious and secular images. In Indian art, the secular and the religious cannot be separate; they are part of an integral whole. Images such as the female figure, the tree, and certain animals such as the lion and the elephant, are prevalent. Indian art, especially Buddhist themes, heavily influenced the arts of other Asian countries, such as China, Japan, Korea, and Thailand, as well as others. India is famous for its paintings, sculpture (Hindu and Buddhist), textiles (cottons, silks, and wools), and jewelry (particularly fine filigree work).Chinese art, spanning the time frame from the Neolithic age through the 21st century, reflects the world’s longest continuous civilization. The principle of harmonious balance, which underlies all Chinese culture, is exemplified in Chinese art. Chinese art is a balance of tradition and innovation, native and foreign ideas, and religious and secular images. Buddhist influence from India can be seen in much of Chinese art. China’s emperors were patrons of the arts, and most artists were government employees. In contrast, amateur artists, free from restraints of the Chinese court, produced individualistic works. Artists were highly trained, and skills were handed down from generation to generation. Chinese art features calligraphy, brush paintings (especially landscapes), carved jade, carved lacquer, and ceramics, especially porcelain.Japanese art reflects the tumultuous history of the Japanese people, with sudden invasions of new ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. The Japanese absorbed, imitated, and assimilated various foreign cultures; thus, their artwork is a mixture of native and foreign influences. The earliest Japanese art was influenced by Chinese Buddhism. Painting is the preferred form of artistic expression in Japan. Writing was traditionally done with a brush rather than a pen, and the familiarity with brush techniques influenced their artwork. Japanese ceramics are considered to be among the finest in the world. Japanese art is valued for its simplicity and its colorful exuberance, and had a considerable influence on 19th and 20th century Western painting.Korean art is a synthesis of Chinese influences and native traditions, and features bold color, natural forms, and lively surface decorations. These styles influenced Japanese art. Thailand, famed for its architecture, Buddhist sculpture and dance, is best known among fine art collectors for its fine silk textiles. Indonesia is famed for batik art, a textile technique using wax resistant dyeing. In batik, melted wax is used to paint designs on both sides of a piece of cloth. The cloth is then dipped in dye, which is absorbed by the unwaxed areas, creating a light pattern on a darker background. The wax is then removed, and the process is repeated, until the desired design is achieved.Latin American ArtBefore European colonization reached the Americas, the cultures of Latin America developed civilizations that rivaled the artistic and intellectual accomplishments of China, India, and the Mediterranean. Latin American art is characterized by an awareness of dualities in nature: land and water, sun and moon, day and night, and life and death. Cultures include the Maya, the Aztec, Toltec, Olmec, Inca, and Mixtec, among others. In addition to impressive architecture, these cultures produced sculptures, wall paintings, and pottery.After European colonization, Latin American artists continued to be influenced by pre-Colombian cultures, mixing European traditions such as oil painting with Indian themes and images. Latin American artists include those working in Mexico, Central and South America, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Caribbean, as well as US artists that come from those countries. Famous Latin American artists include Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, and Jose Orozco. Many of the works by these artists feature autobiographical, political and social themes.Southwest ArtThe term “Southwest Art” refers to artwork produced by Native Americans from the Southwestern United States, and generally reflects traditional Native American themes. Historically, art was not considered a vocation by itself by American Indians, but was linked to crafts and the design of beautiful and useful items for ritual purposes, storytelling, or daily living. Modern American Indian arts reflect the native heritage of the artist, and contain elements of traditional culture and modern Western styles. Some Native artists adhere closely to tradition, preserving older art forms, while others feature more modern themes.Contemporary ArtContemporary art can be defined variously as art produced at this present point in time or art produced since World War II. The definition of the word contemporary would support the first view, but museums of contemporary art commonly define their collections as consisting of art produced since World War II. Some people, however, consider contemporary art to be art produced within the viewer’s lifetime, or that dating from the 1960s or 1970s.Whatever terminology you use, contemporary art tends to have certain characteristics. These are a tendency to rebel against artistic and social constraints, a trust in the artist’s inner vision, personal expression, an emphasis on real life and current social issues, and a tendency to experiment and innovate as often as possible. The best way to describe contemporary art is “anything goes.”Historical American ArtMany people find an old painting in their attic or at a yard sale. While most of these works are the products of amateur artists, some turn out to be quite valuable. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, American artists primarily painted landscapes and portraits in a realistic style. A parallel development taking shape in rural America was the American craft movement, which began as a reaction to the industrial revolution. Developments in modern art in Europe came to America from exhibitions in New York City. After World War II, New York replaced Paris as the center of the art world.Since then many American Movements have shaped Modern and Post Modern art. Art in the United States today covers a huge range of styles. These include Southwest Art, Abstract Expressionism, Folk art, the Harlem Renaissance, and New Deal Art (art commissioned by the Federal Government during the Great Depression). Major American artists include Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Georgia O’Keefe, Thomas Hart Benton, Edward Hopper, Grant Wood, Jackson Pollock, illustrator Norman Rockwell, Mary Cassat, and Andrew Wyeth. Folk artists such as Grandma Moses and Howard Finster are also well known.Fine Art PhotographyFine art photography refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer as artist. Fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism, which provides visual support for stories, mainly in the print media, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to sell products or services.Fine Art PrintsIn addition to producing original works, many artists have prints made of their work and sell these at a reduced price. As printmaking technologies have improved, prints themselves have become collectible forms of art.Giclée prints have become a major part of the limited edition fine art world. Giclée prints are archival quality fine art digital prints. The image is scanned into a computer and digitally enhanced to match the original work of art. The image is then printed with a high resolution ink jet printer onto various substrates, including canvas as well as paper. Sometimes hand embellishments are used to give the look of an original piece of fine art.Signed and numbered fine art prints usually sell for $5,000 or less, and are an affordable option for the novice art collector.Outsider and Folk ArtFolk art encompasses art produced from an indigenous culture or by peasants or other laboring tradespeople. In contrast to fine art, folk art is primarily utilitarian and decorative rather than purely aesthetic. On the other hand, many 18th and 19th century American folk art painters made their living by their work, including itinerant portrait painters, some of whom produced large bodies of work. Contemporary folk art can be viewed includes artists who have been self-taught, whose work was often developed in isolation or in small communities across the country.BEGINNING AN ART COLLECTIONStarting an art collection is not as expensive as you might think. You don’t have to start with a Van Gogh or Picasso original. There are many lesser-known artists whose work is valued in the art world, and up-and-coming artists whose works are becoming well-known and will increase in value. In addition, signed artist prints can offer a stepping-stone into the art world and can be purchased for much less than original paintings.ResearchThe first step in beginning an art collection is to know how to determine the value of a piece of art. For this, you have to know how to do research.If you already have a piece of artwork in your possession and want to determine its value, take multiple photos of the piece. Measure it and weigh it, and take notes on what it is made of, how it is made, the title and subject, any inscriptions or marks on the piece, and the artist’s signature and date. Turn over the canvas or sculpture and locate any stamps or marks on the back or underneath. If you have the artist’s name, look it up in an encyclopedia or online resource such as Artcyclopedia.When you have exhausted online resources, go to the main branch of your local library and consult reference books or speak with reference librarians. Find out the names of art appraisers or experts who can help with more advanced questions. Sometimes your local art museum will have an art library or a curator with whom you can speak.Fine art reference resources include signature and monogram directories, indexes and dictionaries with biographical information on various artists, and price guides for artwork, such as The Art Sales Index and Mayer International Auction Records.If your piece is unsigned and you have no idea who created it, consult an art librarian at your local library or museum. If you live close to a major university, there may be an expert in their art department who can help you. Or you can find an expert such as an art appraiser, who will evaluate your art for a fee. The American Association of appraisers and The American Society of Appraisers provide online lists of certified fine arts appraisers. Sometimes local auctioneers will have a free art appraisal day. However, you should be wary of placing your complete trust in someone who has an interest in buying or selling the artwork.Finally, you need to find out if your particular piece of artwork has a tainted past. Just as you would not purchase a home or a car without a clear title, you must make sure your work is not stolen. The Art Loss Register is an organization that will conduct a search (for a fee) to determine if your work has a questionable past. They have a website with information on various forms of art theft. Most stolen art can be identified by looking at auction catalogues.PricingIf you want to know the selling prices for a given artist, there are organizations who specialize in providing the latest art auction results. These include ArtPrice and Telepraisal. For prints, the International Fine Prints Association has a website where you can search for print dealers in your area and a detailed guide to prints.Tips For The BeginnerIf you are planning to start an art collection, here are some tips that may prove helpful.First of all, even though your art collection is an investment, you should begin by purchasing art because it appeals to you and will enhance your life. Not every piece you purchase will increase in value, but every piece can bring pleasure and add to the beauty of your environment.To become more knowledgeable about your areas of interest, visit as many art galleries as you can, and talk to the staff there. When you visit, be sure to get on their mailing lists. Also, become a member of your local art museums and take advantage of the resources they offer. Talk to other art collectors about what they have learned about collecting art. Read books on art history and subscribe magazines on art and art collecting. Also, be sure to read reviews by local and national art critics. You can also work with a professional art advisor who will guide you in your purchasing efforts.After you get an idea of what you like and the areas you want to explore, you will probably begin to specialize in one or two artists or genres. It’s hard to be an expert in everything, and most collectors specialize in order to gain experience. Decide how much money you can afford to invest. If you have less than $30,000, you will probably want to specialize in contemporary art (30 years old or less). Prints and drawings are even more affordable, generally selling for $5,000 or less.To familiarize yourself with basic art concepts, a good beginning text is The Story of Art by Ernest Gombrich. Magazines like Art & Antiques and Art in America are also good resources. The latter publishes an annual guide that lists galleries by genre. Prices at galleries tend to be set, and bargaining is discouraged. However, it is acceptable to offer a trade of a work you already own. A red dot stuck on the label means that the work has already been sold; a green or half-red dot means that the work has been reserved by another buyer. If you cannot visit a major gallery or auction house, you might want to participate in an online auction at a site such as eBay.Many experts recommend, however, that you develop a relationship with a reputable art dealer, who can advise you, place bids for you at auctions, and let you know when items of interest come available on the market. Of course, there is a charge for using a dealer; a dealer’s commission is sometimes as much as 50% of the work’s selling price.However, if you are careful and do your research thoroughly, your art collection can increase in value and pay for itself. And, if not, you will definitely broaden your horizons, enrich your life, and surround yourself with objects of beauty.",
Mashups,"Mashups Information  Introduction Mashup is also called as a blend. It is made by blending or mixing two or more songs. The mashup is also called by many other names like blend or mash up. Blends, Bastard pop, Powermixing and boots or bootlegs are some of the other names that this genre of music. The usual method in which it is created is by changing the instrumental and vocal tracks from one song to another. 

Though this may be thought to be infringing on the copyright of the song since the vocal or instrumental tracks of the existing song is used, it is not true because it is claimed that it comes in the fair use in the laws of copyright. There are also instances where there have been problems with copyright infringements, especially when a mashup has been done to make a profit from a hit music. 

Mashup is a great hobby too. There are many professionals who use this method of recreating music to make money, but just as professionals go about creating new tracks, there are also many individuals who use this method as a hobby. Playing musical instruments gives you a lot of relaxation, but when you are able to change an existing music track and create your own masterpiece, you will not only have a great sense of relaxation but you will also have a great sense of achievement. 

Mashups are very popular as they create an element of excitement in all the people who hear these new tracks. They first became very popular in the serial called Glee, which is an American serial. From that time, there has been no turning back for the popularity of mashups. These days, they are very common in various programs. The popularity of these has also made it possible for many people to start the creation of new tracks as a business and a source of income. Though this has helped many to earn their living, it is also considered to be one of the best hobbies. 
History of Mashup Mashups were created first in the mid 1990’s, but they became popular later than that, probably in the beginning of the new millennium. Though these were popular much later, the history of mixing the voice track and the instrumental tracks started as people experimented with them decades ago, probably even from the time when recorded music started becoming popular. 

Though many of the different kinds of music have eveolved over the years, the genre of music as far as a mashup is concerned has not evolved to a great deal. The reason for this is that the mashup itself has evolved from music and so it has caught the imagination of people and has become very popular. In fact mashup and its creation is so popular that many people are even taking it up as a hobby. 

There have been many popular and notable mash ups. One of the very popular ones is A stroke of Genius. This was released in the year 2001. Smells like a booty was also released in 2001. Mylo released Doctor pressure in the year 2005, though it was first made by Phil ‘n’ Dog. In the album Collision course, Numb/Encore was so famous that it won even a Grammy. This highlights the popularity of various mash ups. People with little knowledge about mash ups can learn about the art of creating a new music in the place of an original one. If you have the creativity and the will to do it, you will be able to make a huge difference and create some heart throbbing music mash ups. 

Unlike many of the other genres of music, the mashups have been popular for a long time. There are many who love this kind of music. This is especially true in those who have heard both the original track and the one that is remade, the difference in the music is enjoyed a great deal. Many people have started taking this up as a hobby in trying to recreate new music. 
Types and Genres of mashup
A vs B Putting an a cappella against a completely different backing track in order to make a ""third song"" is the original ""mission"" of bastard pop, and it is no surprise that, in the wake of ""A Stroke of Genie-us"", the genre has continued to focus on this basic premise.  
Version vs Version Mixing two or more versions of a song to create a duet or alternate version of a song is what a version vs version is set to accomplish. It can mix 2 different versions of a song, such as a Ballad and Original version, or a cover version of the song. Some of the more popular version to version mixes are language mixes. Mixing multiple languages into one song. Version vs Version mashups usually have the same original instrumental but sometimes it is changed to benefit the song.  
Abstract Mash Ups Music collages which refer to avant-garde music practice and Musique Concrète. These are not intended for the dance floor and are made using all types of music and sound as valid sound sources to be played simultaneously and often manipulated. Beat matching and stylistic or aesthetic similarities are not an important factor in these mash ups. Chaos, dissonance and harmony are all possible results.  
Glitch pop Glitch pop is a subgenre of the bastard pop scene which marries the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) wizardry associated with Kid 606 and Tigerbeat6 records to the ostensibly familiar contours of pop. Sometimes this is done in a spirit of homage; sometimes it serves merely as a form of ridicule and even vilification; often it is both at the same time. 

In the UK, the most notable exponent of the genre is Poj Masta, a teenage schoolboy whose work has been keenly supported by DJs such as Eddy Temple-Morris and James Hyman of London`s Xfm radio station. Their weekly show, The Remix, has played a major role in nurturing new bootleggers and bringing them to the attention of a wide audience.  
Remixes Technically, all pop songs are remixes. But while most are made up entirely of plundered material, some bootleggers have fused old a cappellas with completely new compositions of their own devising.  
Bootleg albums DJ Danger Mouse`s critically acclaimed remix project The Grey Album effectively launched a new pop subgenre. While The Beatles had made appearances on several mash-up tracks prior to this album (for instance PPM`s ""A Life In The Day"" and JPL`s ""Let It Be Missy Elliott (Beatlesmix)""), The Grey Album distinguished itself by being made up entirely of samples from The Beatles` White Album and vocals from Jay-Z`s The Black Album. The project received considerable attention following EMI`s legal threats towards distributors of the album.   Though there are many types and subgenres of mashups, you should make sure that you understand that it is the concept of changing the music track or the sound track so that the music of one album or song is mixed to the vocal track of another one. This should never be confused with some of the other ones that are based on the other aspects like comedy tracks. Those are called as cutups. 

There are many people who use the videos and even the spoken materials to have a different sound track for it. Though the principle behind both of these is the same, they are different in what they actually are. The mashup deals with only the music and songs, while cut ups and other things deal with videos and spoken words. 
Notable mash ups - ""A Stroke of Genius"" by Freelance Hellraiser - ""Smells like Booty"" by 2ManyDJs, As Heard On Radio Soulwax Vol. 1. (Combines ""Bootylicious"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"") - The Grey Album by Danger Mouse - mashup of Jay-Z`s The Black Album with The Beatles` The White Album - ""Doctor Pressure"" originally created by Phil `n` Dog in 2004, eventually released by Mylo in 2005. - ""Numb/Encore"" by Linkin Park & Jay-Z, the most popular of the six mash-ups on their album Collision Course. The song was a hit amongst radio stations and eventually went on to win a Grammy. 
Tools that are needed Creating a mashup is a technical job. There are some equipments that are required to create a mashup. Some of the common equipments that are used in recreating music are the Digital audio editor which helps in editing the audio track digitally. This makes the process of recreating music to be simple and easy. The other equipment that are used include the sampler, sequencer and DJ turntables. The audio mixer is also an important equipment that is used in mixing the various audio tracks and plays a major role in the recreation of the music. 

Though the use of various hi technology instruments in creating mashup is important, there is another important aspect to the creation of mashup. This is the use of various kinds of software in the making of a mashup. There are many tools, editors that are available online and can be downloaded for a price. Some of the software needs to be installed using a disk. The common software that are used in the creation of mashup include those like Wavelab, Cool Edit Pro, Soundforge and others. The most important of the software tools that play a huge role in the mashup creation industry are the Cubase and the digital audio workstation. 

There are many advantages of using different kinds of software to create a mashup. The main advantage is that it is very easy for the creation of a mashup as no hard work is really needed. Beat mapping which is the method used in the process of synchronization of music with different tempos is very helpful and saves a lot of time. If this was a manual process, then it would take a very long time to get the right tempo. Other than saving a lot of time, the other advantage of using software to create mashup is the high quality of the music that is produced. All the processes including the production, mixing and editing are digital in nature. This increases the quality of the mashup which is produced as an outcome of the whole process. 

Even those who have little knowledge about the techniques need not worry because of the digitalization and the creation of a mashup with software. All you need to have is a little knowledge about the music and that is enough. You do not even need to worry about the fact that you may not be able to handle the software. Almost all the software tools that are used are simple and easy to use. You will be able to create amazing mashup music by just using the software tools and the other equipment. 

The cost of these equipment can vary from place to place because they are electronic goods. Though the cost may also vary depending on the extent to which you would like to digitalize the mashup. There are some people who use the traditional methods to create mashups. These people use very less equipments and even if they do use these modern gadgets, they use equipments only when it is absolutely needed. On the other hand, some of the people who have started their hobby recently in making music using mashup method are all fully into buying various kinds of equipment and software so that everything can become digitalized. This helps to increase the quality of the mash up that is created and also makes the whole process simpler as there is very little manual work that really needs to be done. 
Popularization of the Mashup Popularity of the mashup is not a very difficult process because once you have created a new track of music using the audio track from one album and the instrumental track from another album. The internet is the medium in which most of the mashup finds a global audience. In the decades before the rampant use of internet, the music needed to be physically distributed to various people. These days, the internet supports the easy transfer of music files. All you need to do is to post it and the interested people will download the mashup. 

The easy transmission of mashup has created a world of opportunity for any person who is interested in recreating music in this method. Other than selling the mashup, if you are a starter in the business, then you can just give it out free initially to make yourself more popular. Once you have been able to get the attention of a lot of people on the internet or when you have started having many fans, you can start selling the products. This way, people will know what they are paying for. If you have created the first mashup and then try to sell it, you will hardly have any buyers because no one knows who you are. 

To make the mashup popular, you can also use the social media to a great extent. Social media along with social networks are the two most important mediums that you can use to make your creation more popular. You can even sell the songs that you have created in the social media. Once you have become very popular and have a regular following and a growing fan base, you can start creating a web site of your own. This will further help in popularizing your creation. You should remember that if you are creating mashups as a hobby, then it is very important that you do not become commercial very quickly because you lose the joy of creating a new product. 
Can you do it? The creation of a mashup is very simple if you start doing it. The reason for the simplicity is that there are various kinds of equipment and software tools that exist already. All you need to have is a little creativity and you are good to go. Many start up businesses have made an attempt to recreate music in this method. Many individuals also try to create a mashup as a hobby. The reason for this is that it is really a satisfying job and is completely legal. 

You will be able to enthrall your family and friends with the album that you have created using the instrumental music from one source and using another audio track. The resulting music is so amazing that you will not only be able to use it as a hobby, but it can also become a money making venture for you. 
Copyright issues Though there are no major problems when you have the mashup creation as a hobby, it does cause some copyright problems if it is produced on a massive scale and distributed for making a profit in a business. This can cause the original owners to cry foul. Copyright infringements can be a very tedious legal hassle and so if you are planning to go on a big scale, then it would be better to get the approval of the actual creators of the music to prevent these hassles. 

In fact there have been instances where legal production of a mashup has been hugely successful.",
Drum Set,"Drum Set Information  History The original use of the drum dates back in history to inhabitants all over the world as forms of communication, in one way or another. In western Africa, talking drums date back as far as the ancient Ghana Empire. The way the drummers made their drums “talk” was determined by the drum’s construction and the tonal qualities of the local language. The pitch variations and inflections were very effective at communicating over long distances. In Sri Lanka, talking drums were the mode of communication used between state and local governments. The next natural application of drumming was its combined communication for military purposes. Drumming not only kept the beat for marching exercises, but it was a natural way to boost spirits as troops entered battle (and also a good way to intimidate the opposing armies). Fife-and-drum corps came into use by Swiss mercenary foot soldiers; thus introducing the first actual snare drum. In the English Civil War, rope-suspended drums were used to communicate orders from senior officers over the noise of the battle. Different regiments and companies were distinguished by their particular drumbeat patterns, which only they could recognize. More recently, the Scottish introduced pipe bands into their Highland regiments. 
The Drum’s Voice What you use to strike your drum head will also cause a wide range of resulting sounds. The most common implement (besides the hands) for striking drums are standard drum sticks. Rock musicians, orchestras, marching bands, etc., use them, and depending what type of drum they hit (snare, tom, or cymbal) and where on the head they hit (as in rim shots), differing sounds will result. The sticks used on base drums and gongs are called mallets. Steel drums (also known as pans) require the use of sticks with rubber tips, and sometimes their drummers use two sticks in each hand. The implement used to strike a Bodhrán (an Irish drum) is called a tipper, and both ends are shaped to strike its goatskin head. For softer effects, drummers choose soft or straw brushes. 
How to Make a Bodhrán • Use a rotary saw to cut each end of an ash plank at a 45 degree angle. The cuts should be parallel to each other, so that when bent into a circle they will come together to form a continuous scarf joint. • Fill two stew pots with water--the larger the better, because you`re going to need a lot of water. Heat it to boiling. • Pour boiling water over your ash plank with a ladle to soften it. You`ll need a helper to keep water boiling and help you keep pouring it over the wood as you work. • Bend the ash plank into a loose circle whose ends overlap. You may use your hands and feet to do this, or you might enlist another helper for this job. • Tighten three band clamps around the overlapping ends of the plank and cinch them down until the ends of the scarf joint are about to meet. • Apply wood glue to both sides of the scarf joint. Cinch the band clamps the rest of the way down. Make sure the joint comes together cleanly, then leave it secured by the clamps for at least 2 days while the glue dries. • Remove the clamps once the wood glue has dried. • To mount the skin, use the marker to draw a line all the way around the outside of the drum frame, 1 inch back from the side the skin will be on. • Soak your rawhide goatskin in water until it`s soft and flexible. • Set the Bodhrán frame on a clean, level working surface, with the side that will have the skin mounted on it facing up. • Place the soaked goatskin over the Bodhrán frame, making sure that the side of the skin with pores--tiny holes--on it faces up. • Use the staple gun to fasten the goatskin in place, stapling along the line you drew with the marker. Alternate your stapling locations: In other words, staple first at 3 o`clock, then at 9 o`clock, around the rim. Then place a staple at 12 o`clock, another at 6 o`clock, and so on. • Place the leather strip over the line of staples and use the mallet to pound upholstery tacks through the leather into the drum frame, so that the leather and the tacks cover the line of staples holding the skin in place. • Let the goatskin drum head dry--this may take anywhere from 1 to several days or longer. Be patient and don`t touch it until it dries. Once it`s dry, your Bodhrán is ready. 
How to Tune a Drum Not all drums are tunable. You will know if you have a tunable drum by checking its rim or underside. If there are tension rods on the side or rectangular metal knobs on the inside, you will be able to tune it. Trap set drums are tunable through the use of tension rods, which are manipulated by lugs and keys). Timpani drums are tuned the same way, but their kettle resonance pitch is perfected by a mechanical pedal or roller chain system. Bodhráns are tuned from underneath, with a small Allen wrench-type bar. The skins of doumbeks or djembes (typical of Middle Eastern or African hand drums) are tuned by tightening or loosening the ropes that hold on the head of the drum. 

In an orchestra or marching band, it is going to make a big difference which pitch or timbre comes from your drum. Or, depending on how particular you are about how your hand drum meshes with other instruments (including other drums), you may want to adjust your pitch so that your playing complements the others. But most people don’t bother tuning their hand drums unless they feel the skin on the head is getting too tight (dry) or loose (damp). For this reason many people choose synthetic heads that don’t crack or wear as easily. For what you may lose in the day-to-day sound of the drum, you will make up in savings on head replacements. 

Tuning the lugs on a drum is like tightening the bolts on a tire--you want don`t want to go around the drum in a circle, you want to move back and forth across the drum. First, make sure your snare is de-activated. Pick a lug to start at, any one will do. Say you turn it one and a half times, be sure to turn every lug (using the tuning pattern below) the same amount to keep the skin uniform. Keep tuning opposite lugs until they are all snug. Once you get the drum head snug, it’s time to actually “tune” the drum. Grab a drumstick, and tap 1-2 inches from any lug on the drum skin. How does it sound? If it’s the sound you want, use that lug as your “guide lug”. Again you want to tune your drums by tapping opposites, making sure you are tapping the same distance from the lug as the first tap. Make sure you tune every lug has the same sound in front of it or the whole drum will sound out of pitch. All that is left now is to find the right sound for you and the music you are playing. 
The Drum Kit A full size drum set without any additional percussion instruments has a bass drum, floor tom, snare drum, tom-toms, and a variety of cymbals including hi-hat cymbals, ride cymbal and a crash cymbal. Various music genres dictate the stylistically appropriate use of the drum kit`s set-up. For example, in most forms of rock music, the bass drum, hi-hat and snare drum are the primary instruments used to create a drum beat, whereas in jazz, ride and snare patterns tend to be more prevalent. 
Electronic/Digital Drums In the 2000s, an increasing number of drummers have begun to use electronic drum pads which trigger synthesized or sampled drum sounds. This has not only eliminated to need to tune (for most applications) but has also increased the drummer’s options exponentially. When an electronic drum pad is struck, a voltage change is triggered in the embedded piezoelectric transducer (piezo) or force sensitive resistor (FSR). The resultant signals are transmitted to an electronic ""drum brain"" via TS or TRS cables, and are translated into digital waveforms, which produce the desired percussion sound assigned to that particular trigger pad. Most newer drum modules have trigger inputs for 2 or more cymbals, a kick, 3-4 toms, a dual-zone snare, (head and rim) and a hi-hat. The hi-hat has a foot controller which produces open and closed sounds with some models offering variations in-between. By having the ability to assign different sounds to any given pad, the electronic drummer has nearly unlimited potential for configuring many different sounding drum kits from one set of electronic drums. Additionally, electronic drummers can sample non-percussive sounds and use them as drum sounds, as is the case with most industrial music. Many see this as a great advantage over acoustic drums, as one can have a jazz, rock or ballad drum set by merely changing the kit selector switch on the module. Drummers famous for using electronic drum sets are performers such as Rick Allen of Def Leppard, Phil Collins (of Genesis), Nick Mason (Pink Floyd), Roger Taylor (Queen), and Alan White of Yes. 
What to Practice This is where the fun comes into play. Rather than starting out with an entire trap set, many rock and folk musicians will start with a tom or two, or they might start with a practice pad. You can get formal practice through lessons, or you can learn from instructional CDs. Or you can practice informally with your own music or the radio, taking note of what rhythms are being used and trying to mimic what you hear. Get a general feel for the various basic rhythms (solos and improv will come much later). If you find need to fine tune the way you hold your drumstick or tipper, don’t be afraid to go back to the instructional CD, etc., or friend who is already successful with the technique. 
Where to Play Get involved in the music scene! You don’t need to have a formal “band” to get together with others to improve yourself. Probably the simplest groups to join are called drum circles, where hand drums are used. One person will start a rhythm, and then polyrhythms are layered on top by the various players. The ideal result will be a very mature, very dimensional sound. After several minutes of this, the various layers will thin out, at which point another person is free to start another rhythm. 

If you want to take your hobby to something more organized, try getting together with friends who like the same music you do. Be brave—it doesn’t need to be on a formal basis at first. Some people ask their friends to bring instruments to parties, and after a good round of appetizers and drink, they find it’s not nearly as intimidating to bring out an instrument or sing. This is a good way to find out whose sound meshes best with yours. If you have no friends who sing or play, try group lessons at a local music school to meet new people and improve your method. Or simply go to the schools and check out their bulletin boards—most schools allow their students and teachers to post business cards and opportunities on these boards. The Craigslist music section consistently has listings of people looking for others to build blues, jazz, rock, country, grunge and metal bands with them. 

If classical is more to your liking, you will need more formal training. Check the internet yellow pages or your local symphony to find a teacher. Most symphonic members supplement their incomes with instrument lessons.",

Windsurfing,"Windsurfing Information  Introduction: Windsurfing is a sport activity which is performed on the water surface using the sailing and surfing elements. Windsurfing is popularly taken up as a recreational activity and non-competitive basis. A windsurf can reach high speeds and allows access to interesting remote areas. A surfer can enjoy the waves with windsurfing. 

Windsurfing is also known by the name of boardsailing. Windsurfing have different levels as well as types, all depending upon the wind speed, board, sail sizes and wave structure. 

Ever since windsurfing evolved, it has gained world-wide popularity. Nowadays, professional competitions are held all over the world. It is also a popular sport event in Olympic as well. 

Windsurfing has no age limits. A person with any age limit can enjoy this water sport including kids. 
Basic Windsurfing Gear Windsurfing is comprised of four basic equipments. These are:  
Board It is one of the most important pieces of equipment. It makes up the base of the sail. On the board, the windsurfer stands. A beginner board is lighter as compared to professional board and are mostly flat boards. 

Modern windsurfing boards can be classified into these categories: 

• Freeride: Boards meant for comfortable recreational cruising (mostly straight-line sailing and occasional turning) at planing speed (aka blasting), mainly in flat waters or in light to moderate swell. 

• Formula Windsurfing Class: Shorter boards up to one meter in width, for use in Formula Windsurfing races. See below for a more detailed description. 

• Wave boards: Smaller, lighter, more maneuverable boards for use in breaking waves. Characteristically, sailors on wave boards perform high jumps while sailing against waves, and they ride the face of a wave performing narrow linked turns (bottom turns, cutbacks, and top-turns) in a similar way to surfing. 

• Freestyle boards: Related to wave boards in terms of maneuverability, these are wider, higher volume boards geared specifically at performing acrobatic tricks (jumps, rotations, slides, flips and loops) on flat water. • Slalom boards: Shortboards aimed at top speed, rather than maneuverability or ease of use. 

• Beginner boards: (sometimes called funboards) these often have a daggerboard, are almost as wide as Formula boards, and have plenty of volume, hence stability. 

• Racing longboards: Mistral One Design, or the Olympic RS:X class race boards.  
Sail Sail is a piece of fabric and is available in variety of sizes and shapes. It provides power by wind harnessing. For a beginner, it is advisable to use soft sail which doesn’t generate power as well as are easier to steer. Once a beginner has gained experience and becomes an expert, he can always go for hard sail which generates a lot of power and speed. 

Mast 

It is a pole (or set of conjoined poles) which are used for holding the sail. Mast should be strong so that it can cope up with the strong wind and water force. Typically, if a mast has more carbon fibre in it, the better quality it will have. 

Boom 

It is used for adjusting the direction of sail. Boom is attached to mast as well as around the sail. 
How to Purchase windsurfing Gear If you go out into the market to shop for windsurf equipment, you will find a variety of them, having different makes or specifications. Hence, it has become quite difficult to choose the right gear for windsurfing. When going out to buy windsurfing gears, here are few tips which might be helpful to you. 

Seek professional advice: if you are beginner then probably you don’t have the idea of purchasing the right equipment and which suits your requirements. Hence, it is advisable that you should take help from a professional or a windsurfer instructor. He will guide you on how to make the right choice. Remember getting the right piece of equipment is very much important if you want to proceed to the next level. Making wrong choice for equipment can set you back. 

Don’t go for looks: Don’t simply buy because the piece was the best looking amongst all the choices available. Always, make sure to identify your requirements and then choose the right sail, boom or mast accordingly. 

Protective gear: For a beginner getting protective gears is very much important. Never neglect the importance of helmet, life jackets and wetsuits. Remember to purchase good quality ones since these will protect you against injuries while you are learning. Also, the wetsuits are available in variety i.e. wetsuits for warm water or wetsuits for cold water. So make sure you choose according to your requirement. 

Durable and strong: Always go for durable and strong equipment. Make sure to buy a quality product which should be able to handle the power of the wind. 

Read reviews: You can go online or search in magazines to read reviews of particular equipment. This will give you an idea about the equipment itself and whether you should purchase it or not. You will be able to get a complete detailed idea with both negative and positive points of the equipment. This will make it easier for you to decide. 

Check out Variety: A lot of variety is available in the market especially for the board so make sure you shop around and see the variety available. This will not only help you in making the right decision but will also let you make a comparison of various price offers on same piece of equipment. You can then easily decide for the best deal, which will provide you with quality equipment within your budget limit. 

Keeping these few tips in mind will certainly make purchasing gear much easier. 
How to windsurf The board should be positioned such that the wind is blowing across it. 

• The sail should be positioned such that the board and mast are parallel across the wind. Mast should be extending beyond the back of the board, with the sail’s clew pointing downward. 

• Pull the mast in parallel with the water, into the wind to clear the sail. 

• Now, you should place the back foot on the board and let the mast forward by swinging into the wind. Increase the power by keeping close to the water. 

• With the help of a downwind steering steer a broadreach. 

• As the wind will catch up the sail, using your back hand sheet in and allow the wind to pull you up onto back foot. Make sure you don’t pull using your arms otherwise it will sail down and result in reduction in lift. Instead, you should allow the wind to pull you up and you should fully extend your arms. 

• For providing additional boost you should roll up on the board before kicking your front foot. 

• Carefully step over the centreline using your front foot. 

• Hook on boom and into the harness line. Now step back into the footstraps and move across the water as if you are a skipping stone. 

In order to learn windsurfing, it is advisable that you should hire an instructor who will help you learn the right way. He will provide you with guidance as well lessons which will help you a lot. Also, an instructor will not only give you lessons but he will also guide you in making the right purchase for the equipment. He will tell you which piece of equipment is suitable as a beginner, as an intermediate and as a professional. The instructor will focus upon you and you only. You can also learn in a group learning which many find more fun and enjoyable since everyone learning is at the same level, having similar interest as well as provides competitive environment at the same time. You can join basic windsurfing courses to learn this way. 

You should make sure to listen to his instructions carefully and ensure that you are patient. Also, at any point if you feel confused make sure you point it out or clarify any doubts that you have. 
Windsurfing balances Initially, beginners find it quite difficult to stay on the board and fall into the water no matter what position they are in. They have no idea where are they going wrong. The reason behind taking a fall whenever they stand is the incorrect balance. There are 4 windsurfing balance and losing any one of them will cause you to fall into water. In order to stay on board and not fall, one needs to know these 4 balances. They are: 

Board Balance: 

The board should be kept flat all the times in order to maintain the balance. You will fall if the board heels. For keeping the board flat, keep the foot on centre-line or at least near it. 

Rig Balance: 

To maintain balance and avoid falling into water, you will need to make sure you have a balanced rig. Rig should be self-supported. The mast should be almost over the board’s centre line while mast’s tip will be on the base. In order to make sure you have achieved mast balance, you should let loose for a second your hands. If the rig doesn’t fall on to any side of the mast or the clew then it means you have a balanced rig. 

Body Balance: 

For balance, you must make sure that minimum pulling is done. Keep your shoulders back with butt in. The knees should be bent always. Do flexing in and out with wind using your knees and not do it with your bottom. Weight should be supported by the back foot while drive the force using the front foot. This will make sure your balance is kept on back foot in case wind slacks. 

Power Balance: 

If you are a beginner then you will find it the hardest to learn. Power balance is to balance yourself against the wind. You should dissipate the power through the foot of the mast to the board, powering up slowly, while pushing the board. This will allow you to reduce the power which will allow for more powering up. During this whole time you should rake the rig for balance over the wind. If the rig is balanced properly, you can leave it alone for a second or more. As the wind starts becoming stronger, enough power is provided which will allow the surfer to hang onto the rig and helps the rig balance against wind. 
Tips • In case of an emergency, here are few useful tips: 

o Never leave your board and try to remain calm. This will ensure that you float as well as allow for visibility. 

o Send a help signal which can be done by crossing your arms over your head and waving. 

o Once rescuers arrive, cooperate with them 

• Learn to balance by experimenting with falling a few times. 

• Make sure you wear helmets and lifejackets 

• Learn how to swim if you don’t know already 

• Prefer one-to-one lessons if you can afford 

• When sailing, initially sail with an experienced person and listen carefully to what he says. You will not only feel comfortable but safe as well.

Mountaineering,"Mountaineering Information  Intro Okay, so you love heights and wish to explore the mountainous terrains around you! If you wish to learn mountaineering for the endeavor, then this is the right place for you as you will now learn quite a bit about mountaineering basics, rules and etiquettes, physical fitness and equipment required for mountaineering. To cut it short, you are going to learn the basics so that you can start your mountaineering expedition to feel that adrenaline rush through your body. 
Physical fitness A pre-requisite of mountaineering is physical fitness. You require strength and endurance for climbing. Thus, to make it a safe climb you need to go through preparation and training to condition your body and your mindset. Physical conditions are very demanding and you need to workout specifically for mountaineering. However, you can make it an enjoyable exercise by keeping yourself motivated. Every person`s body is different and hence, every person needs to progress at his/her own speed and pace, depending upon how much of physical exercise can one endure at a point of time. First and foremost you need to get a medical checkup done so that you are fully aware of your present health condition. Based on this, you need to minimize potential problems and chalk out a fitness regime for yourself.   Before you start your regular fitness schedule, you should practice a few stretching exercises. This will relax the tension in your muscles and will make it more flexible, thus preventing injuries and strain. Another important aspect of climbing, or for that matter, any physically demanding job, is breathing properly. You should learn a few breathing exercises to increase your capacity to breathe efficiently. Cardiovascular stamina is also very necessary for mountaineering. You should try various physical activities like running, stepping, swimming, and bicycling to increase your cardiovascular stamina and level of endurance. This will also strengthen your leg muscles that will help you for climbing. As you progress with physically demanding exercises, you can increase their duration. While practicing running up and down the stairs, you can start doing so with some load on your back. Keep increasing the load as you progress. Mountaineering is done on rugged terrains so try practicing the same on rocky local site. 
Rules and Regulations of Mountaineering Like any other sport, mountaineering too has some basic rules to be followed. Always keep them in mind so that you can make the most of your expedition. Before you set off, be sure that you are absolutely fit for this kind of strenuous activity. People who are out of shape or not medically fit have more chances of getting injured and having accidents. This is sure to come in the way of your fellow mountaineers too. Additionally, you should also make sure that you have good equipment and adequate food and water to meet your requirements. Always try to carry out the activity within a team so that there are people around when you need help. You should also be well informed about the mountain you wish to climb. For this, you can either join an expedition team that already knows about the mountain or you should carry the latest trail map of the same. 

A very important thing to do before climbing is to inform people of your climb so that they can look out for you if you do not get there on the scheduled time. On your way up or down, preserve the surroundings. Do not litter the place and do not take anything from the mountain. Use products that are eco-friendly and do not pollute water by any means. Always follow the instructions of your team leader and do not trail. It not only causes harm to nature, but also increases your chances of getting lost. You might feel like going on, but when the odds are against you, do not climb any further. 
Plan your Climb Before embarking upon your trip, you need to know your climbing area very well. Find out how difficult is it to climb the mountain of your choice and how long is it going to take. People who have already climbed that mountain can help you with tips and advice. It is better if someone, who knows the mountain or the trail, can join you during your campaign. Though weather conditions depend upon the time of the year you are climbing, it is said that anything can happen on the mountains. So, you should be ready for the unexpected. Do not forget to carry along all the necessary equipment, food, water, jackets, first-aid kit, extra clothing, flash, etc. You can water proof your bags by placing a plastic bag inside the bag you wish to carry. Additionally, you should also wear proper clothes that allow you freedom of movement. You should prepare your body for the physical hardships expected and your mindset to deal with these hardships with a calm and poised attitude. 
Mountaineering Equipment Mountaineering is simple if you are trekking or hiking. However, the same task becomes very tough and risky if you take on ice-mountaineering. If you wish to attempt ice-mountaineering, you should have the basic knowledge of how to use crampons and the ice-axe. You should also have a sound knowledge of rope-work and knots and have advanced skills of navigation. Winter mountaineering has more risk involved as there are chances of suffering from medical conditions like hypothermia or from mountain hazards like crevasses and snow slopes. Some equipments required for ice-mountaineering are crampons, ice axes, ropes, harnesses, sleeping bags, tents, alpine backpacks, map, compass, shovel, whistle, first aid kit, waterproof pants and jackets, woolens, snow boots, sunglasses, and of course food and water. 

Once you have made your self physically fit and have equipped your self with the necessary equipment and knowledge, you are ready for your mountain expedition. So, start with it right away and get going for the adventure of a lifetime, which is sure to come time and time again as you fall in love with the mountains and their beauty.",
Rabbits,"Rabbits Information  Introduction Out side of the most popular domestic pets, the cat and dog, the rabbit is a beloved pet that has been the part of many people’s live in North America. Perhaps our love for rabbits is influenced by a certain cartoon rabbit who goes by the name of Bugs Bunny, or even the famous Roger Rabbit and with his gorgeous wife Jessica Rabbit, but perhaps neither of these are the reason rabbits are so popular. The fact is that rabbits are a fantastic household pet because they share a lot of the behavior of cats and dogs. They grind their teeth like cats meow when they are content, and they do a little dance that is equivalent to a dog wagging its tale. It’s shocking how amazing these little guys truly are when you compare them to the most popular pets around, plus they are incredibly intelligent creatures, and just like cats and dogs, they quickly become a part of your family. The only downside for the animal is that as bunnies, they are so incredibly cute that people can’t help themselves to purchasing one. The problem is that these types of people do not know the amount of work and financial cost that is associated with owning a rabbit, and before they know it, they have full sized rabbit on their hands but no long want to take care of them. Unfortunately, there are thousands of rabbits released into the wild for this reason alone where they are simply incapable to survive by themselves. Like any other animal, with enough hard work and patience, a rabbit could be the best pet you ever owned. 
What is a Rabbit? Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world. There are seven different genera in the family classified as rabbits, including the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), cottontail rabbits (genus Sylvilagus; 13 species), and the Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi, an endangered species on Amami Ōshima, Japan). There are many other species of rabbit, and these, along with pikas and hares, make up the order Lagomorpha. 
Purchasing Your First Rabbit Although bunnies are one of the cutest animals there is when it comes to domestic pets, its curtness has gotten the species into trouble over the years. It is absolutely important to consider the time commitment, space requirements, lifestyle changes, and cost before acquiring a rabbit, as well as how it will interact with kids and other pets you may have. The fact is that bunnies will one day grow into rabbits, and for a lot of people, they will lose that baby cuteness they once had. Typically, people who decide they don`t want their rabbits anymore either take them to animal shelters or turn them loose in the woods. The result of these actions is more rabbits are put to death by shelter workers, or since domestic rabbits are rarely adapted to fend for themselves outside of the family home, die quickly in the wild. 

There are many rescue groups, humane societies, animal shelters, and individuals that have rabbits available for adoption, typically free or for a small fee to recoup the cost associated with food and housing. Additionally, reputable breeders and pet stores sell a variety of rabbit breeds. Pet stores are often considered the least preferable place to acquire a new rabbit as the rabbit`s history is unknown and many come from pet farms with poor conditions, which is the case of a few apples spoiling the bunch. Some stores, however, do document the history of their stock, which can be used to verify their environmental conditions, and take pride in selling quality animals. 

A rabbit is suitable for a household with the time and energy to care for and interact with it. While children often have the time and interest, house rabbit organizations caution that a rabbit does not make a good pet for small children because they may not know how to stay quiet, calm and gentle around the rabbit because let’s face it, children see something they want and they grab it as fast as they can. As prey animals, rabbits are alert, timid creatures that startle easily, so small excited kids can put a lot of stress into the life of a rabbit. They also have fragile bones, especially in their backs, that require support on the belly and bottom when picked up, which small children may not know prior to picking them up. Children over eight years old usually have the ability to care for a rabbit if provided with proper instruction. They need to understand the fragility of a rabbit compared to other pets and the danger of injury or death associated with mishandling or rough play. 

Rabbits are very social animals, and in short time, they will become part of the family, just as cats, dogs, and birds do and often get along well with these other animals. It is not uncommon to see a house rabbit grooming a cat, dog, or another rabbit. Socialization takes time, especially between two rabbits, where the process is called bonding. Until two rabbits are bonded, they tend to be territorial, aggressive, and could be considered a danger to each other. In fact, a quick search on Google will display countless pictures of rabbits laying with other animals common to households. You always have to be careful of cat and dogs because a rabbit is a prey item, play can quickly turn rough and in some cases violent. 

A rabbit needs at least two hours per day of out-of-cage time in a safe environment because they have strong muscles in their hind legs that will weaken if it is not given opportunities to run, jump, and play. In a lot of ways, a rabbit is quite similar to both the dog and the cat in the way it responds to certain stimulus. When a rabbit plays, it will often do a binky, which is a happy dance where it will jump into the air, turn around, and take off running. This is the equivalent of a dog`s tail wagging or a cat pouncing in a play-like manner. When calm and being petted on the head or cheeks, it may gently grind its teeth with contentment, which is the equivalent of a cat purring and is a sign that the rabbit feels comfortable and happy with its environment. Rabbits enjoy gentle, quiet attention from their human counterparts. Although they seem to enjoy it, most rabbits do not like to be cuddled, which takes them too far from their natural comfort zone as prey animals because they need to stay in a state of alert caution. Like dogs and cats, Rabbits can be taught to follow voice commands such as coming when called by name. 
Required Equipment Although Rabbits then to share a lot of the behaviors as dogs and cats, it is a fact that they do need certain types of equipment to stay safe and healthy. The main thing rabbits need is an enclosure that is at least 4 times the total length of the rabbit. Typical enclosures are x-pens, multiple-level condos, large dog cages, a room, and even a whole house. The general rule is that the more space you can give them the better because they do need a lot of space to run, jump, and play. A puppy training folding fence of 26 or more inches high serves as a great simplistic pen, which is called an exercise pen or x-pen for short. It provides more free space and is easier to clean than some traditional cages. Multiple x-pens can be joined to enlarge the enclosed area. An x-pen’s portability is useful for travel with rabbits and for introduction and bonding. 

A multiple-level condo is used to minimize floor space while keeping the rabbit quarters large. The rabbit condo can be made by using cable ties and storage cubes available at home supply stores. Corrugated plastic and carpet remnants are commonly used as flooring. A multiple-level condo provides the rabbit plenty of jumping options and variety. The owner chooses the dimensions and layout. This option is of course meant for those handy enough to create their own pen, and is obviously not meant for children to do on their own. A rabbit-proofed room outfitted with a litter box, toys, and food can also serve as an enclosure, but is also great for a simple area for the rabbit to run, jump, and play in. Rooms shared with humans, such as a bedroom or a kitchen, are typical, and where it is practical to rabbit-proof an entire house, a rabbit can freely roam the house as cats and dogs do. Depending on the rabbit, multiple litter boxes strategically placed around the house is a good idea to avoid accidents. I don’t think there is anything worse than stepping on a fresh pile of poop with bare feet. Yuck! 

Within its enclosure, a rabbit will benefit from a small shelter to hide and rest in, such as a cardboard box, plastic containers, or artificial logs. The only problem with wood hides is that sometimes the shelter doubles as a chew toy. Alternatively, a towel or cloth may be hung from the top of the cage to section off a small, dark area. Shy or skittish rabbits use these to achieve a sense of the safety of a burrow. A rabbit is easily trained to use a litter box, especially if neutered. When placed in a new area, it is common for a rabbit to mark the area with its droppings. After it gets acquainted to the area, it will naturally favor a certain location. A litter box filled with about one inch of non-toxic litter is placed there. Cat litter boxes are commonly used; additionally, pet stores sell small animal litter boxes marketed toward small rabbits and ferrets. Most pet stores carry safe litter that is easy to handle, clean, and absorbent. Clay based cat litter, scented cat litter and clumping cat litter should not be used with rabbits. 

Rabbits need to play to keep their minds active and bodies trim. Rotating through a collection of toys provides variety and keeps their interest. Since they play with toys by chewing on them, all toys must be non-toxic and include cardboard boxes with holes cut in them, toilet paper rolls stuffed with hay, PVC pipe to tunnel through is an excellent idea to mimic burrows and tunnels, balls with holes for food to tumble out challenges their intelligence, plastic rattles for the rabbit to toss are a consistent favorite, and straw mats or untreated wicker baskets to chew through is always a fun game for a rabbit. All rabbits need wood toys that they can chew on to wear down their teeth, which will continue to grow to malocclusion if they have nothing to chew. 
Conclusion There are a lot of questions one should ask prior to purchasing a rabbit from a pet store, breeder, or animal shelter. Simply buying a rabbit because it is cute will not suffice because in the long run there is a good chance that you will get board of your pet and have to give it away. Just because they are small and cute doesn’t mean they are easy or even inexpensive to take care of because they simple are not of either. Purchasing a rabbit is a life changing experience, and if you are willing to make the sacrifices, a rabbit will be one of the positive influences in your life. They are intelligent creatures that seem to be more like a combination of cats and dogs, they are fun to play with because they can grow such strong bonds, and they quickly become a part of your family by bonding with your family and other pets. The one thing you always have to remember is to never release them into the wild, especially if they are not neutered, because if they are able to survive on their own, they will breed like crazy and destroy local habitats. There is a lot of truth behind the statement breed like bunnies as they are one of the fastest reproducers in the pet industry. But with a lot of love and support, a hobby involving rabbits can inspire a vast about of passion into one’s life because they are such an unlikely companion.",
Ball and Jacks,"Ball and Jacks Information  Introduction Playing jacks with a ball and jacks is a game children have enjoyed for hundreds of years. It is a simple game and quite inexpensive to purchase. Jacks are one of the few games you can have as many players as you like or only one player. The unusual thing about jacks as compared to other games today is you can play it without the need for all those expensive electronics! 
Material Balls and Jacks Are Made From Over the years the material balls and jacks are made from have changed considerably. In ancient times when the game began children played the game with what ever they could find available. The tools for this game were originally not manufactured or produced by anyone. The children found the tools for this game outside on the ground. Usually knuckle bones or stones were used for the jacks and the ball was also usually a stone. Because the ball was of stone or some object as equally hard the ball did not bounce as it does today. The Children just through the stone or object in the air and grabbed the knuckle bone or stone and cause the makeshift ball before it landed on the ground or surface they were playing on. Knuckle bones had nubs or points on them, thus created later the jack with points on them. Later versions of the jacks were made of clay, wood, ivory, or other hard material shaped into a square. 

Jacks and balls over the last 100 years have changed. The balls are generally made of solid rubber and are small. There is some jack balls that are hallow light weight hard plastic and are usually sold with plastic jacks. The balls are about the size of a healthy walnut. This size makes it easier to catch the ball and grab the jacks holding them in the same hand. 

Jacks are usually made of light weight hard plastic or metal. The jacks have 6 prongs, 1 each on the top and bottom and four around the sides which are rounded at the ends. There are generally 10 jacks to a set. However, there are exceptions to that. There are also varied sizes of the balls and jacks depending on what you prefer. 
Best Surfaces to Play Jacks On The best surface to play jacks on is a hard, smooth, flat surface, and preferably as level as possible. It is best to play on such surfaces as concrete, linoleum, hardwood, or tile. The thing to be careful of with tile and concrete is if there are cracks they can interfere with the bouncing of the ball. Tables may be used to play jacks on as well. However, if you are going to play jacks on a table it would be best to stand to play the game because sitting causes the player to be close enough to the jacks to be clumsy when playing. 
Where Can You Purchase This Game? Depending on the quality for balls and jacks you can purchase them at any number of stores such as Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target, the dollar store such as Dollar Tree, Dollar General and Deals. This game can also be purchased in some grocery stores such as Kroger, Save-A-Lot, and many others. You can also purchase ball and jacks on line on such sites as Amazon, EBay, and most stores have an online site. The advantage to purchasing games such as this online is you can get a wider variety in size, material they are made of, and styles such as retro. The prices range from $1.00 up. 
Strategies for Playing Jacks Be sure the tools you have to play the game are adequate. If the ball is too hard it will not bounce well, thus possibly causing you to miss. The ball you use to play jacks should be very rubbery and bouncy. If the jacks are too light weight they might be difficult to grab. Metal jacks are the best to use when playing this game. Using a ball or jacks that are too large can make it more difficult to bounce the ball or grab the jacks. Using a ball or jacks that are too small will cause the same problem. Standard size jacks and ball are the most effective tools to use to play jacks.   When throwing the jacks, do not throw them too hard or grabbing them in twosies on up will be more difficult. Throwing them too softly could cause them to clump together making it difficult to grab one or more jacks. 
How to Play To first determine who plays first in the game someone in the game must throw the jacks up in the air and each player catches as many as they can. The player who has caught the most jacks gets to play first. 

The basic ball and jacks game is simple. You throw the jacks down scattering them on the table, ground, or whatever playing surface you are using. After you throw the jacks, if any of them are touching (or kissing as it is called), you can either leave them like that or toss them again. Depending on where you are at in the game it may be to your advantage to have some jacks together. For example, if when you toss the jacks two of the jacks are touching and you are on twosies they will be easier to pick up. You then put the ball in your hand, throw it in the air and pick up a jack catching the ball after it bounces once without dropping the jack. Lay the jack aside and continue picking up the jacks this way until you have picked them all up. This is called onesies. When you have completed picking up all the jacks in onesies, then you do the same thing over again only this time you pick up two jacks at a time. Picking up two jacks at a time with each throw of the ball is called twosies. You continue to do this until you are on tensies, when you pick up all ten jacks with the throw of the ball. If there are an odd number of jacks, such as 7 instead of 10, and you are on twoseis, you can pick up the extra jack first and then do all the others in twoseis. This is called “queens before kings” or “horse before carriage”. 

Each player continues to get a turn until the player misses the ball, fails to pick up the jacks or drops or moves a jack. That player is then out of the game. The last player in the game is the winner. The winner gets to start the new game. 
Variations of the Game The game can continue with common variations: o Eggs in the basket or cherries in the basket; The player cups the hand they are not tossing the ball with and play the onesies to tensies as they did before except the player puts the jacks in their cupped hand instead of laying them down with each turn. o Pigs in the pen; the player scatters the jacks and holds the palm down on the ground that the player is not tossing the ball with. The player then throws the ball up with the other hand and picks up the appropriate amount of jacks before the ball bounces. After the ball bounces once, circle the hand holding the jacks around the bouncing ball and catch the ball with the hand still holding the jacks. o Double bounce; Instead of letting the ball bounce once, the player lets it bounce twice before they catch it. o No Bounce; the player has to pick up the jacks without allowing the ball to bounce. o Double jacks; the player picks up jacks twice and catches the ball before it bounces more then once. o Around the World; the player hold the hand that is not tossing the ball palm up, throws the ball with the other hand, and picks up the correct number of jacks with the hand they tossed the ball with. Circle your hand with the jacks around the bouncing ball and catch the ball, then putting the jacks in the palm up hand. o Over the fence; the player puts their hand flat on the ground and the jacks are placed on the other side of the hand or fence and this is where they are picked up from during the game. o Strike a Match; when the player bounces the ball they must drag the jack across the playing surface instead of picking it up. o Poison hand; The player puts their hand behind their back while playing, keeping all the jacks in their hand as they continue to pick up the jacks 

The above list is not by any means an exhaustive list. It barely touches on the variation and games of ball and jacks. There are more variations and games being invented every day. 
Purposes and Uses for Ball and Jacks You might be asking yourself, how many uses can such a simple game have? Certainly there is the simple use of occupying the children with a simple and economic game. Ball and jacks also make a wonderful gift and stocking stuffer. It is also a good theme for the next party your children have. For example, why not make the next child’s birthday party you have to host a retro party of vintage games such as jacks or use the jacks for competition and the winner gets to keep the jacks set? This is also a budget friendly toy and party favorite.   Ball and jack sets could even be use as a money maker at your church or other organization. Let the children get involved and have competitions for people to donate to. Or if the adults feel young at heart, let them compete too.   Ball and jack sets are also used in schools for recreation time and therapy for challenged children. For example, children with autism or children who have difficulty with fine motor can benefit from playing jacks. This game is also used in mental health institution and centers. With children, a relaxing game sometimes helps them communicate. There are times when playing such games as jacks are therapeutic to children. 
Benefits of Ball and Jack Games Though playing jacks may be busy work for kids, you may be amazed to know how much physical and psychological benefits playing with a ball and jacks can have. In order to be able to play jack well you have to develop good concentration and coordination skills. Thus this development will help the individual in other ways and with other tasks.

Since playing jacks is fun, the game also helps you relax. Relaxation is important to the good health and immune system of the body. In addition, after a day of physically demanding activity it is nice for the children to have games that require sitting so they can wind down. However, keep in mind the stress level may increase if a player is playing the game with more skilled players. 

Just as most products ball and jacks serve a financial good. To produce them there is an increase in business and job. The revenue from the sales also gives revenue in the form of taxes to the government supporting our nation as a whole. This revenue only covers a percentage, but, as they say, every little bit helps.

Maybe we adults should go out and buy us some inexpensive fun too! Who says we are too old to play jacks? You’re as old as you feel and with ball and jacks, there really is no age limit!",
Grilling,"Grilling Information  Introduction The art of grilling has existed since man was able to create both fire and a crude stone plate to set over top of it. Grilling is essentially cooking food by directly heating it from a single direction, generally from beneath. Grilling that involves heat from above is referred to as broiling in North America. They are both very hot processes, and depending on the tools used, can result in drier food than when using other methods. There are many subsets of grilling, with variations by region, culture, tools, and even altitude. 
History Grilling was “discovered” by human ancestors approximately half a million years ago, some time after they had figured out how to make and sustain fire. What exactly induced them to apply heat directly to meat is unknown, as it is most likely that before the advent of the grill, the people simply ate their meat raw like animals. It is possible that some hunters came across charred remains of animals after a natural forest fire and decided to try the meat, thus starting man’s love affair with cooked food. 

The first cookware was likely not similar to modern grills, and probably consisted of a flat stone that was placed directly on the fire, or a spit - a simple construction which suspended chunks of meat and even whole carcasses over the fire. These methods were used for millennia and were only discontinued when cheap metal became available. Ancient civilizations made use of various cookware of wood, stone, or metal construction, but the modern essence of the grill as a metal gridiron would not come about until the 1700s or so. In the south during that time, pit barbecue became very popular. It produced a very flavorful, tender meat and did not require a great deal of expensive materials - the most important component is a huge hole in the ground. 

While grilling became increasingly practiced in the West after the Civil War era, especially in the southern United States, it wasn’t until after World War II that it entered the cultural consciousness as a social and community event. The postwar period saw an unprecedented migration of middle-class families to smaller communities outside of highly populated cities, which came to be known as the suburbs. With more income from better manufacturing jobs, combined with the space afforded by a typical suburban backyard, grilling became ubiquitous with American middle-class life. 

The modern grill as we know it today was invented in the early 1950s by a metalworker by the name of George Stephen. He took a metal harbor buoy, the tentpole product of a company he partially owned, and cut it in half. He then cut some holes into it and welded on a small handle, inserted a wire gridiron into the middle, attached some legs, and voila - an efficient, portable grill was invented. These first devices were referred to as kettle grills and have a familiar circular shape. They were affectionately referred to as “Sputnik” due to their similarity to the famous spherical Russian satellite that had fascinated the world around that time. While kettle grills and their variants are still on the market today, they have in many backyards been replaced a larger, rectangular, multi-shelf grill with an attached propane tank. The first natural gas grill was invented in the 1960s by William Wepfer and Milton Lancaster. The two designed the grill while working for a natural gas company, and it quickly became popular due to the convenience of gas when compared to wood fires. Today, both natural gas and propane grills are in use.   
Barbecue While the words “grilling” and “barbecue” are often used interchangeably, they actually describe two distinct and very different types of cooking. Grilling is a basic cooking technique in which high levels of heat are applied directly to the surface of food. It is generally a very quick, simple process. Barbecue is a more involved and skill-intensive process that requires that the food (almost always meat) be cooked slowly on a grill, and often smoked, usually with some kind of sauce or dry rub. 

The word barbecue is derived from the Spanish barbecoa, which itself came down from indigenous Arawak tribes in the West Indies, parts of which were later colonized by Spain. The tribespeople cooked their food on a simple wooden structure over a fire. The practice was adapted by Europeans, who would set up large spits over fires and cover the meat with a peppery sauce and then let them slow roast for a few hours. This practice evolved over time and eventually became the modern practice of barbecue, which is a cultural ritual and food preparation method with influence all over the US, especially the southern states. Almost every country has some form of barbecue, with some featuring prominently in national cuisines. China, for instance, has a late-night street meal known as shao kao, in which customers choose skewers of meat, vegetables, and eggs to be grilled in a spice, strongly seasoned sauce. Mobs of young people can be seen crowding shao kao stands after the nightclubs close down each evening. 

While many types of meat are cooked in barbecue, pork and beef are the most widely used, in that order. Unlike conventional grilling, barbecued meats are not placed directly over the coals on the gridiron - they are usually at the other side of the coals/heating element/wood, to avoid cooking the meat too quickly. The philosophy of most barbecue enthusiasts is “low and slow” - a mild temperature for an extended period of time. This allows the smoke of the coals to saturate the meat and give it a distinct flavor. It also helps preserve the moisture of the meat and make it much more tender and soft, which is ideal for more inexpensive cuts of meat that would otherwise be tough and unappetizing. Taking this process to the next level is called smoking, which is cooking and preparing meat almost exclusively via heated smoke. It is a point of contention in the grilling community whether hot smoking is a variety of barbecue or constitutes its own distinct style. Regardless, both types share certain attributes, such as the controlled environment of heat and smoke and the extended cooking time. Smoked meats tend to use dry rubs over wet sauces, the opposite of traditional barbecue. A very common wood used in smoking is mesquite, a scrubby tree whose smoke adds a thick, earthy flavor to foods. 

Smoking was introduced to Europeans by Native Americans, who used the process to make meat products that were light, portable, and kept for long periods of time - strips of meat that are smoked in a certain way become jerky. The idea of a barbecue as a social gathering in the US grew out of the post-Civil War era, when the hunting and slaughtering of wild hogs was a difficult process and cause for celebration in a community. This would become known as the pig roast. Skilled barbecue cooks began to spring up, and would establish semi-permanent tents or hire themselves out for special events. They would eventually become restaurateurs and develop a distinct brand for their recipes and skills. 

Modern barbecue is often defined by its region, which has a direct correlation with the kind of sauce used. Barbecue sauce generally has a vinegar, mustard, or ketchup base, with varying levels of saltiness, sweetness, and spiciness. The recipes and characteristics vary from state to state and even within a state. North Carolina, for instance, has a lot of diversity in sauce. The eastern portion uses a lot of vinegar, while the west prefers ketchup. Memphis barbecue is famous for its strong tomato flavor, as well as its smoking techniques that utilize hickory wood. Texas barbecue uses beef instead of pork and often has a dry rub, with wet sauce on the side.   
Techniques Braising refers to the process of first searing the food by exposing it to an extremely high temperature for a short time, and then letting it sit in a slow cooker with liquid, such as tomato broth or stock of some kind. This process makes the meat extremely tender, so much so that it can often be cut with a fork alone, such as the famous pot roast. Some cultures make extensive use of braising, such as France and China, where stock and broth are replaced with soy sauce. 

The charbroil is another technique used sometimes in America and other locales. When broiling, the heat usually comes from above the food and is at a higher temperature. The food is placed in a special pan with holes to permit higher air flow, and the heating mechanics are convection-based, more like a baking oven. With charbroiling, the heat is raised to the point that the exterior of the meat develops a coating of a burnt, scratchy substance, called char. This gives it a strong flavor and crunchy texture. 

Marinating is an oft-used technique with grilling and barbecue. It infuses strong flavor into meat, achieved by soaking it for an extended period, often overnight, in a mixture of sauces and spices. It also tenderizes the meat and can provide a kind of glaze on its surface when it is grilled. A similar technique is the dry rub, which is a dry mixture of herbs and spices, as its name suggests. It can be applied immediately before cooking if desired, and usually does not need to sit on the meat for hours before preparation, although it will not achieve the same level of embedded flavor as a marinade. Marinades have the added benefit of breaking down some of the carcinogens that are found in grilled meats (see below).   
Grills and equipment Besides the gridiron, kettles, and barbecue described above, grilling includes many other options. For serious smoked meat enthusiasts a dedicated smoker may be a wise investment. Smokers come in many shapes and sizes, but they usually have a cylindrical shape, several racks for the meats, a large coal depository, and a small chimney to release the fumes. A cheap and efficient smoker is the upright drum smoker or UDS (also called an ugly drum smoker due to its homemade appearance), a standard 55-gallon steel drum cut in half lengthwise and sat on one end. Various apparatus, like handles and piping, are then attached or welded on. When finished, it resembles a cylindrical refrigerator and the door opens to reveal several racks of gridiron. The wood is inserted into the bottom of the cylinder and lit; it then travels up through the drum, through the food, and out through the chimney. Restaurant or commercialized smokehouses are huge contraptions that can handle large quantities of meat at a time, and also produce vast quantities of smoke - so much so that 911 centers occasionally get calls from passing citizens who are unaware of the smoking process and believe the building is on fire. 

Flattop grilling is becoming more popular and as you might expect, does not use a regular gridiron grill to cook food. It makes use of a round, flat cooking surface - it differs from a griddle in that it has a circular heating device, and from a grillpan in that it does not have raised ridges to simulate the gridiron. Like all grills, it has the same basic process for cooking food. While griddles have parallel heating elements, those found in flattops are circular, which spreads the heat out over the surface in an even fashion. This makes it popular with diners, who want lots of heat to put out food quickly, and seafood restaurants, who need even heat for their products. This fashion of grilling is very common in India, Central America, and other parts of the world. Japanese flattops are called teppanyaki and have evolved into a kind of entertainment experience in America, with teppanyaki chefs incorporating elements of comedy and juggling into their cooking, which is done at the guests’ table. Hibachi is often incorrectly referred to as teppanyaki; hibachi is simply a small brazier used for basic cooking. 

In North America, the standard grill for personal use is a gas- or propane-fueled rectangular grill, typically with two or three gridiron racks for the meat. Older models use charcoal, and some grillers prefer charcoal because of the smoky essence that they infuse the food with. The grill assembly is set into a cart housing for convenient wheeling, and has some side tables that can hold plates and utensils. Some newer grills also have an infrared component in the rear of the interior, which can be attached to a rotisserie. The rotisserie is powered by a small electric motor, which requires the grill to be plugged in. Infrared cooking helps the meat retain more moisture, and can reach high temperatures very quickly. 

Recent trends in cooking and health practices have given rise to clamshell-type grills such as the famous George Foreman Grill, promoted extensively by the retired boxer. Grilling has become more popular because of the perceived health benefits when compared to other methods of cooking, such as frying or baking. The Foreman grill and others like it are angled and coated with a non-stick substance to allow liquified fat and grease to run off where it can be collected and disposed of. This leads to meat with less fat content, although some meat, such as beef, will always contain high amounts of fat.   
Potential health problems While grilling in general is considered a healthy way to cook food, it is not without its risks. Animal proteins cooked at high temperatures develop carcinogenic compounds. These compounds are created when the amino acids of meat are exposed to heat. Parts of the meat drop onto the coals during cooking (called drippings), causing a reaction that carries the carcinogens over to the flames, which then lick the food. Some seasonings, such as sage and oregano, can reduce this effect when applied during grilling. Food can also be pre-cooked in a microwave and then drained of juice before the grilling, but this will change the flavor of the final product and may defeat the purpose. 
Conclusion Grills run the gamut in price, and you can find small charcoal braziers for $20 or pay hundreds of dollars for a huge grill with all the trimmings. The expensive grills are nice, but are not necessary for a quality grilling experience. All you need is a heat source, something to put the food on, and the food itself, and you’ve got the basics down. Just find a good recipe and you’ll be set!",
Diving,"Diving Information  Introduction It is said that extreme hobbies usually require a budget, lots of travel and hordes of equipment, but that’s not the case. While Diving isn’t considered an ‘extreme’ sport, it will get your adrenaline level to an all new high. It doesn’t require a budget to enjoy and practice as a hobby, nor does it require equipment or for you to travel around the world to enjoy what Diving has to offer. 

Before you read further, note that Diving basically means hurling yourself into a body of water, either off a diving board into a swimming pool at different heights, off the side of a cliff into the ocean or a pool of natural water. It does not however mean diving off anything into a body of water, such as bridges, or into unregulated lakes and other locations where there’s no help at hand or someone on duty to make sure you get the timely help you need if you are injured. 

While Diving can be considered a very safe hobby to participate in and enjoy, nothing, no matter how basic, is 100% safe. Crossing the road, driving a car, flying, nothing is 100% safe no matter what. Rule of thumb, when you are hurling yourself from different heights into a body of water: be safe. 

The great thing about diving is that it is not at all hard to get into as a hobby. You can practice it at any swimming pool with a high diving board or location with a diving platform, and you don’t need special equipment as with sports such as scuba diving. As long as you know how to swim and have the drive to excel and truly enjoy the hobby, then it is a great one to get involved in. 
History of diving Since the beginning of time, people have poked nature and sometimes dived and hurled themselves right at it; or in it as is the case with Diving. Whether it was skinny dipping or proving their loyalty to kings and leaping off cliffs into water, or simply having fun by jumping into pools, diving has been practiced by people for centuries whether they knew it or not. 

During some periods in time, it was mainly used as a measure of courage, the Romans for one would have their soldiers swim for long periods of time to test their endurance, sometimes having them dive into a pool of freezing water, in some cases, crocodile infested, and see how fast they could get out, if at all. 

Leaping from high platforms into water hasn’t only been taken up by the sports sector, it is used for entertainment purposes too. Take circuses for example; years ago, it was a main attraction, the brave divers that would take to the tip of the tent and dive into a seemingly small body of water and survive it! But diving is not the single most popular sport with spectators because it is entertaining, it is also exciting, thrilling, and when practiced by diving professionals who show off the gymnastic and acrobatic skills in the air, it can be breath taking. 
Getting Involved Getting involved and turning Diving into a hobby is not at all difficult, in fact it is rather simple but there are several steps to take beforehand. First off you need to get into shape, you need to be fit and ease yourself into things by going on morning runs and swimming a few times a week before you take to the high board. Simply put, you need to flex your body and get it ready. Alternatively you can just start diving at zero height and work your way up very slowly, staying at the same height for at least a few dozen dives before moving up a little.   Preparation is the key, then it is all about learning the basic dives and mastering them, that comes with practice. There are six main dive groups and five main dives. The dive groups include forward, back, reverse and inward groups among others and the dives consist of straight, pike, tuck, flying and free dives.   • in the Forward Group, the diver takes off facing forward and rotates forward • in the Back Group the diver takes off with their back to the water and rotates backward • in the Reverse Group, the diver takes off facing forward and rotates backward • in the Inward Group, the diver takes off with their back to the water and rotates forward • any dive incorporating an axial twisting movement is in the Twist group • any dive commencing from a handstand is in the Armstand group 
Understanding the Dive During the flight of the dive, one of the five positions may be specified: straight , pike, tuck , free, and flying. If you are looking to get involved in competitions, beyond learning the dives, practicing and hopefully mastering them, you need to actually understand the Dive itself. 

When you take that leap into thin air, whether it is off a diving platform or even the side of a cliff into the ocean, you go into what’s better known as ‘free fall’. This is where gravity becomes the only physical force around your body, the only thing accelerating you with absolutely no resistance. It is not like running down a steep hill, for example, or even snowboarding down the Alps; no, with diving and your body going into free fall, there’s no friction, period. There’s even little to almost no air resistance if you dive it just right. Remember, gravity is one of the most powerful forces on Earth; after all, it keeps everything and everyone from floating into outer space. 

When you dive, this gravity pulls you closer to earth, or the pool/ocean, with no obstacles in its path to slow it down. If you want numbers to crunch, then you will be falling at almost 10 meters a second, just over 32 feet. If you want a breakdown of what this means, realize that since time becomes a factor in the free fall, the longer you keep falling, the faster you will be going. What happens is known as acceleration and every single second you are falling, there’s an increase in velocity for the next second and so on. Think snowball effect but in terms of speed—that’s basically how it plays out. 
Non-competitive diving Cliff diving became an actual recognized Olympic sport in the summer of 1996 when the World High Diving Federation (WHDF) was created. Now, years later, cliff divers, hobbyists just like yourself, travel the globe in search of that perfect dive, the most awesome spot, the adrenaline high of all cliff dives. Most of the cliff dive locations you will visit are exotic, beautiful and simply breathtaking from natural flowing pools in Switzerland to the hot tropics of Jamaica and more. Don’t let your mind drift, you are not cliff diving for the beautiful locations, remember, you are doing it for the gravity defying free plunging dive through nothing but thin air and extreme speeds into a body of water you can’t see past the surface of. Is your heart racing yet? It better be. 

Other Non-competitive diving includes Shallow diving which is an Extreme Sport, whereby enthusiasts attempt to dive from the greatest height into the shallowest depth of water, without sustaining injury. It is typically associated with travelling circuses along with the Strong man, performing animals, clowns and other such attractions. Divers aim to hit the water horizontally in a manner akin to the Belly flop. This spreads the impact over the greatest surface area, and achieves the greatest deceleration. 

Synchronized diving used to be a non-competitive diving sport but was introduced into the Olympic Games in 2000. The event features two divers who attempt to perform identical or mirrored dives. For example, if one diver were performing a forward dive in the pike position, the other diver would perform either an identical forward dive or an inward dive in the pike position, which mirrors its motions. 
Safety concerns Take a moment to think about an average dive height of 6 meters. Once you take a dive at 6 meters, your body will be traveling at 40kph. Really stop to consider this for a second, if you are traveling at 40mph in a car and you hit a brick wall without a seat belt on or hitting the breaks, it is more than possible that it will be a fatal crash. And here you are, diving in your swim suit into a pool of water, if you hit the water wrong, wrong being if you hit it horizontally or back/stomach first, it is considered as hard as landing on solid concrete from that height. You have to make the jump and hit the water with your feet, straight, toes even, or fingers with your body a straight vertical line. A small 6 meter dive if made wrong can easily compress your spine and break bones. 

Considering how there is a danger around diving from any height as injury is usually a result of a poor dive position or location, the WHDF has recommended to the general public that no one dive from 20 meters and upwards. Unless of course there is a professional team of rescuers at hand and located around the diving spot. It is not a law, but a recommendation that is voiced loudly so that everyone from those diving into a pool from 3 meter diving boards to those taking to the 20 meter cliffs, know about it. 

Among the injuries that are caused by diving: 

• Bruising • Fractures • Broken bones • Compressed spinal chords • Dislocated or broken discs • Paralysation and even death 
Some Diving tips for the Eager Hobbyist If you just can’t help yourself or contain your excitement, and truly want to take diving on as a serious hobby, then you need to consider some of the following tips to help you master the art and manage to paddle away from a successful dive safely: 

• Baby steps, there’s no shame in taking it slow and working your way up the ladder. Before you move up to higher dives, work on simple dives from lower boards first. Try to perfect your dive, landing, entrance into the water, pencil dive and more. Just be sure someone is around when you start off to be on the safe side. Try the pencil dive first with your feet pointed down and arms close to your sides plunging feet first, back straight. The aim of this dive is to make the point of entrance/impact as small as possible to reduce the force at which you hit the water. • Again and this cannot be stressed enough, never dive on your own, especially when you are just starting out or diving from high platforms/boards. Always have someone with you, no matter how great a diver you become it is important to have someone with you. Be it a fellow diver or a watcher, someone who’s close but far enough not to obstruct your dive. • If it is cliff diving that you are taking up, before you take that first leap, or any leap for that matter, swim around the area you will be lading in. Make sure it is deep enough, there aren’t any rocks or hidden obstacles that could injure you or prove fatal. • Another important note to keep in mind if you plan to dive from cliffs is how you are going to get out the water. Many times novice divers take the jump into the ocean with waves high that break their dive and help them in a softer landing, but forget to check where these waves are headed. Whether or not they’re drifting and crashing into rocks/cliff side or worse. So make sure you know how you will be getting out the water, picture the dive then swim out how you intend to on the actual dive. • Consider dressing right. A wetsuit is great for higher dives, or just about any dive, in fact. What the wetsuit does is give divers an extra layer of cushioning that reduces the force of impact on the body a little. 
Conclusion Taking up diving as a hobby is a great, healthy, exciting move that practically anyone can do, just about anywhere. Diving is available in almost any city, anywhere in the world so you won’t have to travel and pay costly fees to enjoy the sport. If you do choose to develop your diving skills and take up competitive diving as a hobby, then that’s easily done too. Simply arrive at meets and sign yourself up and impress the judges. It is a high adrenalin boost, low risk sport when all safety precautions are taken and diving is not abused.   Dive safe and you will be fine, but remember, as with any hobby or sport, or anything in life actually, nothing is 100% safe. Always take someone with you and most importantly, be safe and enjoy yourself!",
Meditation,"Meditation Information  Introduction Meditation is the practice of focusing the mind and relaxing the body. When used consistently over time an individual can literally train the mind to obtain clarity and even different levels of consciousness and awareness about themselves, others and their environment. Although originally a spiritual practice often combined with prayer, meditation or meditative practices are now found outside of that traditional use. Many secular uses of meditation include therapy, counseling, exercise and sports training as well as in relaxation and healing practices. 

Most commonly associated with quiet, relaxing places and nature, meditation can really be used anywhere. Many people stereotype meditation as the traditional Buddhism mediation and imagine the practitioner sitting legs crossed in the full locus position with the palms upward on each knee, eyes closed and chanting or humming a mantra. While this is one option for meditation, it certainly isn`t all you have to choose from. 

In the Western world meditation has become very much a part of many types of relaxation and exercise programs. Combining mental meditation with body relaxation is a wonderful way to unwind after a stressful day or to just take a quick break from a challenging problem right at your desk. Meditation used as a scheduled activity in a morning or evening routine helps you to focus, relax and stay positive and relaxed throughout the day. Before bed it helps promote a deeper, more relaxing sleep, allowing you to wake feeling mentally and physically refreshed. 

Occasionally meditation is confused with yoga. While mediation and yoga both involve a practice of thinking and training the mind, yoga is much more involved and requires physical discipline and control as well as mental training and control. Meditation is typically taught during yoga classes and may have more or less of a central focus depending on the specific yoga practice used. 

Meditation as a hobby is a terrific idea and one that is certain to bring an additional level of relaxation and focus to your world, even if you only meditate once or twice a week. The more regularly you use the practice the more effective you will be at clearing your mind and focusing in on specific aspects of your life. Most meditation is relatively short in during with 15 to 30 minute sessions all that is required. Some people enjoy two shorter sessions during the day while others prefer a longer session and supplemental meditative practices throughout the day of just a few minutes each. 

One of the biggest benefits to meditation is, besides the relaxation and well-being it brings, it is a very simple, very easy to learn activity. There is really very little in the way of equipment and you can largely learn through books, DVD`s or online self-instruction types of programs. Of course there are retreats and classes for meditation as well, many which are hosted by recognized meditation leaders from around the world. 
Meditation Styles The Transcendental Meditation technique is a form of mantra meditation. According to proponents, it is effortless when conducted properly. The mantra sound is utilized as a thought in the meditation process, and as a vehicle that allows the individual`s attention to travel naturally to a less active, quieter style of mental functioning. The technique is practiced morning and evening for 15–20 minutes each time. 

Mediation is Buddhist practice is slightly different. This mediation is based on the religion of Buddhism and as such is designed to provide the individual with enlightenment on their life and choices as they become more and more proficient with the technique. Each monastery provides their own style of Buddhist meditation, so there is not one commonly accepted definition of how the specific technique is used. 

One common thread or element in Buddhist meditation is that the individual has to practice what is called anapanasati. This is the word for ""watching the breath"" or controlling the movement of air into and out of the lungs. Used in several types of meditation as well as relaxation and yoga, anapanasati helps to control the body and helps the individual to clear the mind by focusing in on the breathing techniques. It also helps to slow down the metabolic rate of the body, providing a calming effect on the brain and mind and a deeper relaxation in the muscles of the body. 

Hinduism also practices meditation, and this religion is also the practice of yoga as two of the seven components of the practice. Breath control is key in this type of meditation as are the specific physical postures and the ability to cut off input from the senses and simply experience pure thoughts in the mind. This specific discipline is known as pratyahara or withdrawal from the senses. Individuals that are trained in Hindu meditation take years of training to achieve the state of pratyahara during their meditation. 

Jainism, a very ancient India religion, uses meditation as a way to gain enlightenment about acting in non-violent ways towards all living entities. The goal of meditation , which is the core practice within the religion, is to make the individual aware of his or her own thoughts and consciousness. The goal is through understanding of self a great understanding of the world will occur. This is synonymous with spiritual freedom. 

Jainism uses an open eyed glaze, typically on a fixed object, and the individual is in the lotus or cross legged position. Breathing is critical and it is seen as a way to direct the energy flowing through the body and eventually into the world. Like Hindu meditation Jainism also focuses on eliminating any external stimulus such as sounds, touch, temperature or visual distractions. Once this has been achieved there are specific mental exercises that can be included in the meditation. These contemplations are structured to allow the mind to open to new possibilities and enlightenment about the world. 

This is style or type of meditation uses mantras which can be either words or themes. From Jainism the famous ""OM"" mantra is developed. This, sound is actually a very complex verbal symbol for the thought that the speaker is an omniscient soul. 

Taoism also used meditation and contemplation as part of the mental training within the religion. It is also used in martial arts training to prepare the mind for complex motions and body positions. Tai chi, a martial arts technique that is designed to promote physical health and well-being as well as protection uses meditation as part of the training forms and exercises . Energy in the body and remaining calm and tranquil in times of stress are critical elements of this meditative practice. 

New Age meditation includes the model or style of Transcendental meditation discussed earlier. It can also include several other Western style of meditation that can be used with specific breathing techniques, visualization exercises, mantras and focusing in on specific objects. Typically in most of these types of meditation religious or spirituality is not the goal, rather the goal is free form types of thinking, relaxation and connecting with the world and environment on a thought level rather than a physical level. Very popular in the 1960`s and 1970`s, New Age meditation is still very common in conjunction with yoga classes and spiritual classes. 

Although mediation is rooted in religious practices, particularly religions of the East, there does not have to be religious training to learn to use the specific techniques. It is important to do a bit of research and decide which technique you want to use, or perhaps choose a meditation program that simply focuses in on posture, breathing and focus when you get started. After you have gained the basics of the postures and styles you can then specialize in one specific type of meditation or continue on with a western style of meditation. 
Meditation Positions There is no right or wrong way to do meditation, however different styles of meditation may require specific postures or positions. These are often very comfortable once you have practiced the position and are able to relax your body and mind during your session. If you aren`t sure which mediation position you like, try out different options. With sitting on a stool, waling or sitting on a chair even those with physical pain or limitations with sitting cross legged can easily find a way to meditate in comfort. 

Posture and positions are important in meditation, at least until it is comfortable to obtain a meditative state. Focusing in on correct posture and breathing techniques as well as position is one way to help the mind focus and prevent distractions from sneaking in. 
Training and Classes There are several options when it comes to learning the hobby of meditation. As mentioned earlier, this is a very personal type of hobby and one that is not typically considered a group activity. However, learning how to clear your mind and bring your thoughts to a focus can be a bit challenging, especially if you are new to the discipline. 

There are specific meditation trainers available in most major cities and larger areas. If you are considering a specific type of meditation practice because of a religious nature, be sure that the individual teaching the class is aware of your reason for taking the training. Most types of advanced meditation techniques will require that individuals take basic classes first by a certified or accepted trainer so the leader is aware of your expertise with the method. 

Training costs for private meditation tutors or trainers will vary based on the technique and style of meditation you wish to practice. Looking around online can help you both find classes and private trainers as well as learn about the cost of lessons and the requirement for participation in these classes. 

If you just want general meditation training you may want to consider combining it with a beginner`s yoga class. These classes are usually available through community centers, fitness centers and private trainers in most locations. Check out the experience and the qualification of the instructor, paying attention to their understanding of meditation and the methods they use and teach in the class. At the very least the focus will be on breathing techniques and clearing the mind, but posture and position while meditating should also play a part in the training. 

Martial arts training programs may also offer specific classes or tutoring on meditation. If you are considering these types of classes you may be able to get involved in a group activity such as Tai Chi which can be done inside or outside depending on the location and the trainer. 

The internet has made meditation training and practice very easy as well. Many online websites provide a self-guided type of study. These sites list the philosophy or religious background and meaning of the meditation style as well as provide written materials, videos and audio instructions for meditation. As a great free resource these training programs are very effective and may also provide imagines to meditate on as well as wonderful relaxing music to have in the background while you work on your posture and breathing. 
Equipment There is really no requirement for specific equipment to start your meditation hobby, making it a wonderful idea for virtually anyone. Most people find that a large comfortable floor pillow or yoga mat works well for providing a bit of extra cushioning. Remember the goal is to move from experiencing the physical input to the mental processes, so having a nice place to sit is important. 

Wearing the right type of clothing can also help in preventing your physical being from intruding on your mental relaxation and focus. A loose shirt and a pair of sweat pants or shorts is very comfortable and won`t become tight or restricting in any seated position. Socks or bare feet rather than shoes are also recommended for the same reason. 

Some meditation techniques may require an object to focus on. This may be a flower, plant, sunrise or sunset, blank wall or a particular object such as a candle or a stone. These are very common things that you are likely to have in your home already, meaning there is really no extra expense for taking up meditation as a hobby. 

DVD`s, CD`s books and audio-tapes on meditation are also available through fitness stores, health stores and online through different meditation groups. With the range of free information on the web you may find that you don`t need to purchase anything to get started. 
Conclusion Meditation is one of those hobbies that doesn’t take up a lot of time, doesn`t cost anything at all and can really benefit your entire body, mind and spirit. If you haven`t tried meditation yet, browse around online and look through some introductory videos and websites to help you get started. Remember that meditation is not something that is quick and easy to learn, it does take practice, discipline and patience; however it is well worth the effort.",
Stand Up Comedy,"Stand Up Comedy Information  Introduction Do all of your friends and family comment on how funny you are? Are you a natural performer who loves to be in front of an audience and make people laugh? If the answer was yes to any of these questions, then maybe it is time to start practicing for a new career or hobby in stand-up comedy. Since everyone in the world loves to laugh, there is always a place for new comedians to start new stand-up comedy careers. But just because you are funny, doesn’t mean you will be a great stand-up comedian. Stand-up comedy requires well written material, strong improvisation skills, and strong presentation skills. Where it is easy to find places to perform in your own home town, there is great difficulty becoming a great, well-known comedian. 

To be great at stand-up comedy, it is important to learn and fully understand what stand-up comedy is and its rich history that is behind it. By understanding the past, you can learn from the greats of comedy in order to avoid common mistakes, cliché material, or worst of all, accidently stealing someone’s material. The most important thing to remember before starting to get into the hobby is that it is a performance, and the audience is deathly honest of what they think about you and your act. You have to fully expect laughter, cheers, booing, and heckling, and you need to know how to deal with all of them while on the spot. 
What is Stand-Up Comedy Stand up comedy performances are typically short performances where a comedian recites a fast-paced succession of humorous stories, short jokes,, or one-liners, which comprise what is typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, like that of Carrot Top, music, like that of Weird Al Yankovic, or magic tricks, like Penn and Teller, to make their acts stand out. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars, burlesques, colleges, theaters, or pretty much anywhere people are willing to listen because there are no real restrictions to performance space. 

Many smaller venues hold ""open mic"" events that are tailored to the beginner, where anyone can take the stage and perform for the audience. This is the perfect opportunity for amateur performers to hone their craft and possibly break into professionalism. In North America, many comedy clubs feature the now-iconic brick wall as the backdrop for stand-up performances, or the word “IMPROV” plastered across the wall behind the performer. 

What is relatively unknown to most people in the audience is the fact that many stand-up comedians work for years to develop 45 minutes of material, and only usually after practicing their bits repeatedly, a technique that brings perfection to the routine, do they perform them to a live audience. The difficulties of stand-up comedy is expressed by actor-comedian Will Ferrell when he has been quoted calling stand-up comedy ""hard, lonely and vicious”. 
Stand-Up Comedy around the World As you look around the world, it is impossible to find a place that does not encourage stand up comedians to practice their craft in front of audiences. The power to bring a smile to someone’s face is often the best medicine to alleviate the most dreadful symptoms. It is no wonder that people from around the world spend their entire lives dedicated to making people laugh. Some become so popular in their own countries that they often travel around the world to perform their acts for an assortment of audiences. 
How to Get Started Stand up comedy is a natural fit for people who are funny and are constantly attracting attention to themselves. But the most important part of stand-up comedy is the ability to make people laugh. Just because you are funny, does not mean that you can make people laugh. The secret to stand-up comedy is self confidence, comedic timing, and well written material. Thankfully, stand-up comedy is perhaps the easiest field of entertainment for new talent to enter because there are countless small venues that hold ""open mic"" events where anyone who dares to can have a shot at performing comedy before a live audience can have their moment in the spot light. 

For anyone thinking about starting to perform stand-up comedy, it is absolutely essential to visit as many local stand-up comedy clubs as humanly possible to get an idea of what it takes to perform to an unknown audience. Open mic nights are ideal for this as famous comedians have certain followings that are in tune to their style of comedy whereas, an audience who doesn’t know you will let you know right away what they think about your comedy in the form of laughter, boos, or silence. 

When it comes time to start writing your first bit of material, it is useful to purchase books, DVDs, and CDs to learn the basics from the great stand-up comedians of our time. And the moment you have the basic routine written down, it is now time to start practicing the material in front of a mirror and in front of your friends or family before you jump onto a stage to perform. After then it’s on to practicing in front of friends and then open mic night! This is utterly important because if your material is brilliant, you will throw it all away with one bad performance. 

Of course there is always an exception to every rule, and to pretend that they don’t exist is a true shame. While presentation is three quarters of the battle, it is necessary to showcase the power of well written material. The famous, but unfortunately now deceased, stand-up Mitch Hedburg suffered from the most sever stage fright imaginable, and because of his fear, he spent half of his career with his back to the audience and the later half hiding behind his hair and sunglasses. But his one liner style of comedy that audiences couldn’t resist his jokes like, “I don`t have a girlfriend. But I do know a woman who`d be mad at me for saying that”, “A severed foot is the ultimate stocking stuffer”, or “I love blackjack. But I`m not addicted to gambling. I`m addicted to sitting in a semi circle.” 
Styles of Stand-Up Comedy The idea of describing every style of stand-up comedy immediately feels like an impossible task. This is because it is an impossible task because there are an unlimited number of styles that people adhere to, but for the most part, people choose to mix styles to create their own unique style. Some of the more famous styles that you have probably heard of are observational comedy, like that of Jerry Seinfeld, topical comedy, often seen on talk shows like Jay Leno, impressions of famous people, or comedic stories, like those of Dane Cook. 

The problem with certain styles, like observational, topical, and even impression comedy, is that they are used too much and getting old. Not many people really care about observational comedy anymore, and even Jerry Seinfeld has retired from it. Impressions are not necessarily an actual style of comedy. Sure they are fun to hear, but they are more of a talent than a form of comedy. And besides, everyone can do an impression of Jack Nicholson, Robert DeNiro, William Shatner, and Elvis, so we really don’t need to hear your impressions unless they unique. 

Nowadays, comedians get famous for inventing new forms of comedy that people tend to relate to. Examples of this would be Mitch Hedburgs’ one liners, Carrot Tops’ prop comedy, Dane Cooks’ wild stories, or George Carlin’s rage filled rantings. All of these comedians are famous because of their style of comedy, plus they generally have some well written material. Even though I hate Carrot Top, his act is usually quite clever and one of a kind. As long as your material is fresh, and your style is unique to yourself, you will be quite successful in the world of stand-up comedy. 
Tips for Success Keep a notebook with you at all times. You never know when a funny idea will hit you, so it is crucial to have something to make notes on no matter where you are. You also have to ensure that what you write down are thing that YOU have thought of, and isn’t from another act. 

Don’t ever tell your audience what to think. No matter what you tell an audience, they typically believe you. Tell them your act is serious, a drama, isn’t funny, or that they don’t have to stick around and they will believe you. The only you can tell an audience that they won’t listen to is that you act IS funny. 

Avoid at all costs the “Endless Close”. Unfortunately, not every performance of yours will be positive, but it is important to not continue to tell jokes after the final joke bombed. If your final act completely bombed, it is time to walk away, and avoid eating into the next comic’s time. 

All topics are free game, but it is important to ensure that the topics you want to talk about are appropriate for that audience. For instance, people who are sensitive should see comedy that`s billed as a clean/non-offensive show-and the comics who agree to do that show should abide by those guidelines. Many corporate events/ private parties fit into that category and therefore, the comic`s comments should reflect that.   Never steal material from other comedians. It has been said many time above, but there is a level of professionalism that has to go along with being a stand-up comedian, and unless you are willing to work towards your own goals using your own material, you will eventually be called out to be a hack. People want to listen to original material that is fresh and funny. If they wanted what the other guy has, they would go to the other guy. 
Conclusion Stand-up comedy can be a very rewarding experience if you are willing to put the time into that is need to attain success. Not only is it a hobby that can, and has for other comedians, launch new comedians into Hollywood stars that are famous for being funny, but it truly is a fun and rewarding experience. There is not a single person who does not get a sense of pride from making another person laugh or smile, and the chance to do it on a grand scale can be the most rewarding experience of your life. But we again must return to the hardships of the hobby that one has to go through to become a better comedian. At some point in your career, both early on and later, you will have to face hecklers, and you will have to develop a way to respond in a positive manner. The second you explode on stage, vis-a-vi Michael Richards, your career is essentially over. But whether you simply want to make people laugh or want to develop a full time career, you have to dedicate yourself to your art, and you have to learn something that most comedians never learn: How to take a joke.",
Sushi Making,"Sushi Making Information Introduction Sushi has often been a favorite food among Asian cultures but for those from other regions, getting into Sushi may be a difficult task. Not in the least of which is getting over a squeamishness over eating raw fish. But if you are someone who is into trying new things, learning to appreciate sushi will be very easy for you. If on the other hand you can be a picky eater, you can start off with cooked sushi and then work your way toward sushi that is completely raw. 
Sushi for Beginners If you are looking to try sushi for the first time it is likely that you may have second thoughts about eating raw fish. This is quite common among western cultures and as such restaurants have accommodated for it. In addition to specially made sushi geared toward a western appetite they also offer types of sushi that are cooked or that do not even include raw fish. 

If you are simply looking to find something that would be able to eat in a sushi restaurant. There are also vegetarian rolls on offer which so not include any type of meat. But if you do want meat, many restaurants will offer rolls made with fried chicken. There are also types of sushi that are made with egg or even sweet potato, so even if you do not like fish, there are types of sushi that you may enjoy. 

If you do want to go the way of fish but are not yet ready to completely have raw fish then you may want to try tempura sushi. This is sushi that has been fried after being made in order to cook the fish and make it more appealing to western appetites. 

There are two ways in which your sushi can be fried. It can be fried as a roll in which only the outside of the roll is fried and after which it is cut into the customary 8 pieces. With this method the fish in the sushi may not be completely cooked but the tempura shell will often mask the texture of the raw fish and gives the sense that the fish is cooked rather than being raw. The second type of tempura sushi is sushi that is fried after it is cut into pieces. This allows each piece of the sushi to be fried and this allows for the fish to be relatively well cooked and the sushi to be completely covered in a tempura shell. This is a great place for a beginning to start getting used to the idea of eating sushi. 
Japanese and Western Sushi The sushi that you may find in local restaurants may not always be completely authentic. Many western sushi restaurants offer rolls and sushi that you will not be able to find in Asian countries. They include ingredients that are not used in Asian countries and they are made in combinations that are not commonly enjoyed by Asians.  
Western sushi The increasing popularity of sushi in North America as well as around the world has resulted in variations of sushi typically found in the West but rarely if at all in Japan. Such creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll. A wide variety of popular rolls has evolved since. 
How to Make Sushi If you want to get into making sushi yourself it can be a very frustrating thing to learn on your own. Many people will choose to take lessons or purchase books that will teach them the tips and techniques that sushi chefs use. Be prepared to mess up a few times and put in a great deal of practice before your sushi rolls start to turn out like what you may see in restaurants.
Tools If you decide you want to make your own sushi there are a few essential tools that you will need to purchase. 

- Fukin: Kitchen cloth. 

- Hangiri: Rice barrel. 

- Hocho: Kitchen knives. 

- Makisu: Bamboo rolling mat. 

- Ryoribashi: Cooking chopsticks. 

- Shamoji: Wooden rice paddle. 

- Makiyakinabe: Rectangular omelette pan. 

- Oshizushihako: a mold used to make oshizushi. 

You will also need to have on hand a supply of sushi ingredients and knowledge of how to use them.  
Sushi rice Sushi is made with white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a dressing made of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and sake. It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a sushi or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a wooden paddle (shamoji). 

Sushi rice (sushi-meshi or su-meshi 酢飯) is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from India, Thailand, Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness. Rice that is too sticky has a mushy texture; if not sticky enough, it feels dry. Freshly harvested rice (shinmai) typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short grain brown rice and wild rice are also used. 

There are regional variations in sushi rice and, of course, individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kanto region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.  
Nori The black seaweed wrappers used in makimono are called nori. Nori is a type of algae, traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making rice paper. Whereas in Japan, nori may never be toasted before being used in food, many brands found in the U.S. reach drying temperatures above 108 °F (42 °C). 

Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in standard-size sheets about 18 by 21 centimetres (7.1 by 8.3 in). Higher quality nori is thick, smooth, shiny, green, and has no holes. When stored for several months, nori sheets can change color to dark green-brownish. 

The standard size of a whole nori sheet mentioned above influences the size of maki-mono. A full size sheet produces futomaki, and a half produces hosomaki and temaki. To produce gunkan and some other makimono, an appropriately sized piece of nori is cut from a whole sheet. 

Nori by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi. 

When making fukusazushi, a paper-thin omelette may replace a sheet of nori as the wrapping. The omelette is traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan (makiyakinabe), and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.  
Toppings and fillings For culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, fish eaten raw must be fresher and of higher quality than fish which is cooked. The FDA recommends that fish to be eaten raw is frozen before being consumed, as this will kill all parasites (but not all harmful microorganisms). Professional sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly-used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient is toro, the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of ōtoro (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and chūtoro, meaning middle toro, implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut. Aburi style refers to nigiri sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will be completely raw. 

Other seafoods such as squid (ika), eel (anago and unagi), pike conger (hamo), octopus (tako), shrimp (ebi and amaebi), clam (mirugai, aoyagi and akagi), fish roe (ikura, masago, kazunoko and tobiko), sea urchin (uni), crab (kani), and various kinds of shellfish (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi. Oysters, however, are less common, as the taste is not thought to go well with the rice. Kani kama, or imitation crab stick, is commonly subsituted for real crab, most notably in California rolls. 

Pickled daikon radish (takuan) in shinko maki, pickled vegetables (tsukemono), fermented soybeans (nattō) in nattō maki, avocado, cucumber in kappa maki, asparagus, yam, pickled ume (umeboshi), gourd (kanpyō), burdock (gobo), and sweet corn may be mixed with mayonnaise. 

Tofu and eggs (in the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called tamagoyaki and raw quail eggs ride as a gunkan-maki topping) are common.  
Condiments Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in Shōyu, soy sauce, and may be flavored with Wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated root of the Wasabi japonica plant. 

True wasabi has anti-microbial properties and may reduce the risk of food poisoning. The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or samegawa oroshi. An imitation wasabi (seiyo-wasabi), made from horseradish and mustard powder and dyed green is common. It is found at lower-end kaiten zushi restaurants, in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside of Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled ""Japanese Horseradish"". 

Gari, sweet, pickled ginger is eaten with sushi to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion. In Japan, green tea (ocha) is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as mecha. In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as agari. 

From there you will need to find sushi making instructions either from a class, which is the preferred method or from a cookbook that can be purchased at your local bookstore. The best advice for a book is one that you can understand and easily follow, preferably with plenty of pictures. Take your time and flip through the books that your store has available in order to chose the one that is right for you. 

Keeping fresh sushi ingredients in the house can become expensive because sushi should never be made with fish that is not completely fresh and you should never make sushi with fish that has been frozen, because the taste will be different and not as good. You may want to learn to make sushi with less expensive fish and then save the skill for special occasions.",
Coffee Roasting,"Coffee Roasting Information Why Roast Coffee at Home? Aside from the money, home roasted coffee just tastes better! Coffee flavor peaks 12-24 hours after roasting, and coffee beans can lose about 40% of their flavor within two weeks. How long do you think those prepackaged bags of roasted beans have been sitting on the coffeeshop shelf? The only way to be assured that you’re drinking the freshest cup of coffee possible is to roast it yourself. 
It couldn’t be easier to get started roasting your own coffee at home. In fact, aside from some green coffee beans, you probably already have everything you need to get started. 
Although many home roasters use specialized home coffee roasting machines, coffee beans can be roasted in a pan on the stovetop, on a baking sheet in the oven, or even using a popcorn air popper.  Coffee Preparation Process Before you can drink and enjoy your coffee, there are several steps that go into its preparation. First the coffee beans get processed, second the processed coffee beans will get roasted, third the roasted coffee beans will be grinded (to ensure that the brew is optimal), and last the coffee is brewed and served. For Coffee enthusiasts it can be a pleasurable hobby to roast, grind, and brew your own coffee at home.  How Coffee Roasting Works The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging. The actual roasting begins when the temperature inside the bean reaches approximately 200 °C (392 °F), though different varieties of beans differ in moisture and density and therefore roast at different rates. During roasting, caramelization occurs as intense heat breaks down starches in the bean, changing them to simple sugars that begin to brown, changing the color of the bean. Sucrose is rapidly lost during the roasting process and may disappear entirely in darker roasts. During roasting, aromatic oils and acids weaken, changing the flavor; at 205 °C (401 °F), other oils start to develop. One of these oils is caffeol, created at about 200 °C (392 °F), which is largely responsible for coffee`s aroma and flavor.  Coffee Roasting Process • Step 1: Get some green coffee beans. There are a number of websites online where you can purchase green coffee beans. See the resources below for some links.
• Step 2: Bring a 12-inch skillet or medium sized saucepan up to around 450-500 degrees Fahrenheit. • Step 3: Toss in the beans! In a regular 12-inch skillet you probably shouldn’t roast more than 10-12 ounces at once. • Step 4: Cover the pan with a lid and start shaking it! In order to get an even roast, you need to keep those beans moving around! • Step 5: Keep shaking the pan! • Step 6: After about 5 minutes, you’ll probably start to get some smoke. Don’t worry. That’s normal. About this time you’ll start to hear the “first crack”. It sounds sort of like popcorn popping. • Step 7: remove the lid and check the color of the beans. • Step 8: Keep shaking the pan, and once the beans reach the color you want, quickly pour them into the metal bowl or colander to cool. It helps to stir them around with a wooden spoon. • Step 9: Holding the bowl or colander over the sink (or outside- it can get a little messy), gently blow way the chaff (a fine outer skin that separates from the beans during roasting). • Step 10: Let the beans cool to room temperature, and then pour them into a glass jar or other airtight container. Important: don’t seal the lid until the beans have been allowed to “breathe” for 6-12 hours. • Step 11: Grind and brew, and be amazed at the taste difference home roasting can make! 

How long should I roast the beans? When your green coffee beans arrive, they will probably be greenish-gray. As you roast them they’ll darken, first yellowing and then browning. Once you reach very dark roasts, oil will start to form on the surface of the beans. Light roasts tend to exhibit more of the “origin flavor” of the beans- those flavors created by the soil, the weather, the way the beans were processed after picking, etc. Dark roasts tend to result in more “roast flavor”- flavors resulting from the roasting process itself. 
As a general rule, though, coffees from very desirable regions (like Hawaiian Kona and Jamaican Blue Mountain) tend to be roasted to only light levels. If you’re paying extra for that Kona taste, why roast it to the point where the Kona taste is lost? Similarly, if you’ve got some green coffee beans that you’re not too fond of, a dark roast will help to cover up the flavors you don’t care for. 
So what’s the best roast? It’s all a matter of personal taste. Some people prefer light roasts, other people prefer dark roasts. One of the great things about home coffee roasting is that YOU get to pick what combination of bean and roast level you prefer.   Pan Roasting Tips: • Be prepared for some smoke! Be sure to roast in a well-ventilated area, and you may want to open the windows. • Don’t leave the pan unattended! Roasting coffee beans involves very high temperatures. • If your arm gets tired from shaking the pan, you can also use a wooden spoon to stir the beans. Bear in mind that the roast won’t be as even.  Coffee Roasting Equipment A simple technique for roasting green coffee beans is to stir them in a skillet or wok over high heat. Coffee can be roasted in the oven provided that they are put only one bean deep in a perforated baking tray. These methods produce coffee beans with a variety of roast levels as it is almost impossible to achieve a consistent roast merely by stirring, however, some people like the resultant melange roast. This lack of control on stove top roasting has led some home roasters to innovative adaptation of equipment intended for other purposes and fabricating custom equipment. Heat guns (normally used for stripping paint) aimed into metal bowls, home-made steel drums suspended and rotated over outdoor gas grill burners, and modified hot-air popcorn poppers are examples of coffee roasters made from readily available parts. Heat guns and modified hot-air popcorn poppers are the least expensive home roasting equipment. Home bread-making appliances can be modified to roast coffee, too. There are an increasing number of consumer coffee roasters. They automate the roasting process and avoid the hazards of using equipment not designed for high temperature operation. The main drawbacks with many of the dedicated home roasting appliances are their small 75-to-300-gram (2.6 to 11 oz) capacity, limited roasting control, and often slow cooling abilities. Some home roasters design and build roasting equipment from scratch making full-sized sample roasters, diminutive commercial-style coffee roasters, or inventing new roasting machines. Others use off-the-shelf materials, found objects, and simpler construction methods. Such machines typically have greater capacity or roasting control than home roasting appliances.",
Rubiks Cube,"Rubiks Cube Information  Introduction In the mid-seventies, one of the most devious puzzles was invented that went on to stump some of the smartest people in the world. When the Rubik Cube was first invented and released to the mass public, nearly everyone in North America wanted to see if they could solve the impossible three dimensional puzzle. It is perhaps the fact that a majority of individuals could not solve the puzzle that made the Rubik Cube such a popular item, but both the frustration and the love for the little toy has lasted some thirty years to remain just as popular as when it was released. But when is such a simple toy so popular, and why would you want to base a hobby around it? The simple answer is that the challenge alone is worth your time and effort, but the other reason is that solving the puzzle is simple the beginning of the Rubik Cube hobby. 

Once the basics of the puzzle are learned, and by basics I of course mean solving the puzzle, the next step is increasing the speed of solving the Rubik Cube. The hobby of speedcubing, which is essentially the act of solving the Rubik’s cube as fast as one can, has a huge following throughout the hobby. Most of the appeal for people who are not in the hobby is the idea of solving the impossible cube at unheard of speeds. As beginners advance through the ranks and increase their skill, there are the possibilities of solving the cube at ridiculous speeds and even with one’s eyes closed. There is no doubt that the inventor of the Rubik’s cube could never imagine to what heights his simple invention has achieved in terms of competition and fun. 
What is a Rubik’s Cube The Rubik`s Cube is a 3-D mechanical puzzle that was once called the “magic Cube”, but was later renamed Rubik and sold by Ideal Toys. In the year 1980, the puzzle won the German Game of the year, and by January of 2009, 350 million cubes were sold worldwide. It is one of the worlds top selling puzzle game, and often considered to be the world’s best selling toy. 

In a classic Rubik`s Cube, each of the six faces is covered by nine matching colored stickers, traditionally white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. A pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently which mixes up the colors so that all the faces have multiple colored stickers. The problem that most people face is that when you move one face, you also move another, so the trick is to maneuver the faces in such a way that they become grouped together. For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to a solid color. Similar puzzles have now been produced with various numbers of stickers, not all of them by Rubik. The original 3×3×3 version celebrates its thirtieth anniversary in 2010. 
Speedcubing Once the basics of the Rubik are learned by the beginner, the next logical step is Speedcubing (or speedsolving), which is the practice of trying to solve a Rubik`s Cube in the shortest time possible. There are now a number of speedcubing competitions that take place around the world, which showcase the skill and intelligence of Rubik Cube solvers. The contests are usually based on the fasted speed, completing the cube in a certain time span, or a race to the finish with another speedcuber. 

The Guinness Book of World Records organized the first world championship that was held in Munich on March 13, 1981. All Cubes were moved 40 times and lubricated with petroleum jelly to ensure they could be spun and twisted as fast as the competitors could solve the puzzles. The official winner, and first world champion with a record of 38 seconds, was Jury Froeschl, who was born in Munich. The first international world championship was held in Budapest on June 5, 1982, and was won by Minh Thai, a Vietnamese student from Los Angeles, who shattered Froechl’s time by completing the cube in 22.95 seconds. 

Since 2003, the winner of a competition is determined by taking the average time spent soving the Rubik Cube of the middle three of five attempts. However, the single best time of all tries is also recorded for the Guiness Book of World Records. The World Cube Association maintains a history of world records from the earliest of events until the most resent throughout the world. In 2004, the WCA made it mandatory to use a special timing device called a Stackmat timer to achieve the most accurate completion times. 

For those who have advanced past the speedcubing contest, there are informal alternative competitions that have been held which invite participants to solve the Cube in unusual situations. Some of the more unusual are: 

- Blindfolded solving - Solving the Cube with one person blindfolded and the other person saying what moves to do, known as ""Team Blindfold"" - Solving the Cube underwater in a single breath - Solving the Cube using a single hand - Solving the Cube with one`s feet 

Of these informal competitions, the World Cube Association only sanctions blindfolded, one-handed, and feet solving as official competition events. In blindfolded solving, the contestant first studies the scrambled cube, in order to memorize the locations of the colors, and is then blindfolded before beginning to turn the cube`s faces. Their recorded time for this event includes both the time spent examining the cube and the time spent manipulating it. If simply solving the cube is seen as impossible to you, watching a cube being solved blindfolded is simply fascinating. 

Since there are continuous competitions that have competitors constantly attempting to break the current record in speedcubing, there are frequent changes to the record standings. The current world record for single time, on a 3×3×3 Rubik`s Cube was set by Erik Akkersdijk in 2008, who had a best time of 7.08 seconds at the Czech Open 2008. The world record average solve is currently held by Feliks Zemdegs; which is 8.52 seconds at the New Zealand Championships 2010. 

It wouldn’t be a world recorded for Guinness if there wasn’t at least one case of the strange involved. On March 17, 2010, 134 school boys from Dr Challoner`s Grammar School, Amersham, England broke the previous Guinness World Record for most people solving a Rubik`s cube at once in 12 minutes. The previous record set in December 2008 in Santa Ana, CA achieved 96 completions. By breaking this record, others are challenged to form larger groups to challenge the current record. 
Rubik Variations With the popularity of the Rubik cube, there really wasn’t a big surprise that the market flooded almost instantly with imitations and variances of the original game. There are many different variations of Rubik`s Cubes ranging from the original 3x3x3 cube up to seven layers: the 2×2×2 (Pocket/Mini Cube), the standard 3×3×3 cube, the 4×4×4 (Rubik`s Revenge/Master Cube), and the 5×5×5 (Professor`s Cube), the 6×6×6 (V-Cube 6), and 7×7×7 (V-Cube 7). 

CESailor Tech`s E-cube is an electronic variant of the 3x3x3 cube, made with RGB LEDs and switches instead of colored stickers and physically twisting the multiple layers. There are two switches on each row and column that by pressing them indicates the direction of rotation, which causes the LED display to change colors, simulating rotations of the standard Rubik Cube. The product was demonstrated at the Taiwan government show of College designs on October 30, 2008. Another electronic variation of the 3×3×3 Cube is the Rubik`s TouchCube. By sliding your finger across its face, its patterns of colored lights rotate the same way they would on a mechanical cube. The TouchCube is a fairly new creation that was introduced at the American International Toy Fair in New York on February 15, 2009. 

The Cube has inspired an entire new category of puzzles that are commonly referred to as twisty puzzles. These other games includes the cubes of different sizes mentioned above as well as various other geometric shapes. Some such shapes include the tetrahedron (Pyraminx), the octahedron (Skewb Diamond), the dodecahedron (Megaminx), the icosahedron (Dogic). There are also puzzles that change shape such as Rubik`s Snake and the Square One. With the most simple change in shape, the style of play drastically changes and so too must your style of play, if you want to solve the cube in any variance. 
How do I solve it! As there are countless options on how to solve the elusive Rubik’s cube, one of the best options for beginners is to search online sites for instructional videos. These videos are created to teach new speedcubers the basics of the hobby and how to increase their basic skill levels. These videos offer great help for new beginners because instead of trying to interpret written instructions, the instructions are given to you step by step right in front of your eyes. Other teaching aids also include books and videos that can teach you the hobby, and increase your skill. 

Prior to books, videos, and online websites, people who became addicted to the Rubik Cube did so by solving the puzzle with trial and error. As mentioned above, one of the more successful methods of solving the cube is done by using advanced mathematics, but even all of the above is no substitute for great skill and talent when it comes to the more advanced challenges like solving the Rubik’s cube blind. In the end, there is no substitute for dedication and countless hours of practice. 
Conclusion Not only is the Rubik’s cube a challenging hobby, it can also be quite a bit of fun. The initial challenge that all beginners have to face is to figure out a solution to the standard Rubik Cube, and from there, the challenge of speed awaits you. There is nothing more impressive to friends and family than not only completing one of the hardest puzzles ever devised, especially one that they have all tried at one point or another, but by doing it in under a minute. Plus if you can accomplish the deed in under a minute, than maybe it is time to enter a competition or two. On the plus side, if you decide that it is a terrible hobby and that you absolutely hate it, the actual Rubik cube is less than $20 in most stores. So even if you purchase a brand new cube, there is nearly no monetary loss should you decide to throw it in the garbage in complete and utter frustration. But that it from someone who have played with them in the past, they are addicting, and you will spend countless hours sitting on the couch trying to solve the devious Rubik’s Cube. And if true life is anything like the movies, if you have the ability to solve the puzzle, your apparent intelligence skyrockets in the eyes of others!",
Tennis,"Tennis Information Introduction Tennis rules across the globe both as an exciting spectator sport and as a fun hobby. Tennis players run the gamut from highly paid professional athletes competing in major tournaments to amateurs dabbling with friends during the weekends. The able-bodied and people in wheelchairs can compete on the world’s tennis courts. 

The popularity of tennis is likely enhanced by its flexibility as a sport. Tennis can be played at any time of year, indoors or outdoors, and by athletes of any age. 

Whether they are pro athletes or amateur hobbyists, children or adults, the intent of tennis players is to hit a bouncing, felt-covered ball across a net into their rival’s court. Tennis matches are generally played as singles, which consists of two opponents; or played as doubles, which consists of two opposing teams with two players each. Tennis is once again an Olympic sport following a 60-year absence from the Games. 
Equipment A tennis player’s equipment needs are simple, consisting only of a racquet, tennis balls and comfortable shoes and clothes. 

A beginning tennis player should study his or her options before buying that first tennis racquet. Racquets come in a wide variety of materials, and with different traits that influence power, control, shock absorption and maneuverability. For example, the power of a tennis racquet is determined mainly by the head size, frame flexibility and string tension. 

A decent aluminum racquet will cost as little as $30. But the price of a graphite racquet can soar to $300 or more. 

Tennis racquets are generally classified as beginner, advanced or intermediate. A player should choose a racquet with a hitting area of 95 to 105 square inches if his or her athletic skills are better than average. A player should select a racquet with a hitting area up to 115 square inches if his or her athletic skills are less than average. 

A novice tennis player will likely feel most comfortable with a racquet weighing between 10 ounces and 11.5 ounces. 

Beginning tennis players should do their homework and learn what gauge of tennis strings, what type of strings and what string tension is best suited for their playing style, comfort and safety. 

A tennis player’s shoes need to be comfortable and safe. Experts recommend wearing shoes that are specifically designed for playing tennis. Players have the option of choosing from a wide variety of specialized tennis shoes ranging from the inexpensive to costly, designer models. 

Tennis experts warn that injuries can occur if running shoes are worn for tennis. This is because running shoes have a sole that is too unstable for the sideways moves that a player often makes on the tennis court. 

A beginner should know what he or she wants in a tennis shoe. The varieties of upper materials offer different benefits. Canvas uppers stay cool and breathe well. Vinyl uppers offer firm support and rebuff external wetness, but vinyl uppers don’t breathe well and tend to get hot. Leather uppers give strong support and stay dry. 

Tennis clothing should be comfortable. A tremendous variety of clothing is available for sale to the more fashion-conscious players. This gear, consisting of shirts, slacks, skirts, and dresses, can be relatively inexpensive or pricey depending on the brands. Each player must consider comfort, style and usefulness when choosing and buying his or her tennis outfits. 

Thick socks are recommended for tennis players. Players sometimes wear hats or sun visors during play. Tennis players often don sweat bands on their heads to keep perspiration from running into their eyes or wear sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry. 

Other miscellaneous gear sometimes used by tennis players includes sunscreen, sunglasses, racquet covers, vibration dampers amid the racquet strings, sports bags to hold their equipment, and absorbent materials for the racquet handles. 

Not all tennis balls are the same. Tennis balls are manufactured in different speeds and types of felt. Pressureless balls are considered the most durable. 

All tennis players regardless of skill level should purchase extra duty felt balls if they intend to play on hard courts, or regular duty balls if they intend to play on clay courts. Extra duty felt balls are designed specifically for playing on hard court surfaces, which quickly erode the felt covering on the balls. Regular duty balls are designed for playing on clay courts. Clay courts erode the felt less than hard courts, but clay courts tend to “fluff” the balls, according to tennis experts. Extra duty felt balls will become overly fluffed if used on clay courts, while regular duty balls will erode too fast on hard courts. 

There is tennis balls specifically designed for beginners. These have a larger diameter which makes them slower. However most tennis players, both beginners and more advanced athletes, often prefer standard-sized balls. 

For many years, tennis players volleyed with traditional white balls, but the most common color today is a brilliant greenish-yellow called “Optic Yellow.” This change was made to make the balls easier to see. 

Stringing machines and ball machines are gadgets that, while often expensive, can be purchased by tennis players of all skill levels. 
Instruction Tennis lessons with a qualified professional are recommended for beginners. Private lessons are considered the best way to get feedback. However, novices might find that it’s cheaper to learn tennis from studying photo-based lessons that are offered online. Beginners can also videotape themselves playing and then compare that to the photo-based lessons available online. 

Other options for tennis beginners are taking classes offered by local clubs or park districts. 

Novices can find a wealth of information about learning to play and other tips on various websites. They can find written articles and videos to hone their skills. There are also websites where tennis players can find a local playing partner or a facility with tennis courts. Books are another source of instruction for the fledgling tennis player. 

Tennis backboards can provide very useful practice sessions, particularly for beginners. Many tennis facilities and clubs have good backboards for practice sessions. Beginners can also use a high brick or concrete wall if they cannot find a decent backboard locally. Look for a wall higher than one story with no windows and which is adjacent to a parking lot. The higher the wall, the less likely it will be that the beginner will whack the balls over the wall. 

Ball machines are another good practice option. They are found at most tennis facilities and clubs. Individual players can also choose to buy a ball machine, which can range from a small, battery-operated model to a sophisticated machine costing thousands of dollars. 

Ball machines are considered a wise choice for novice tennis players. The repetition offered by ball machines is particularly helpful when the player is seeking to improve a specific shot. But experts warn that the repetition of ball machines can also be a disadvantage and lead to uninspired footwork because the practicing player knows exactly where the balls will land. 
Courts
Court Surfaces Tennis is played on four different court surfaces. These include clay, grass, and hard court surfaces composed of acrylic, asphalt or concrete. The fourth type of surface is carpeting, artificial turf or any other removable court covering. 

The prestigious Wimbledon tournament in London is played on grass. The U.S. Open in New York City is played on Deco Turf, a hard court. The Australian Open in Melbourne is played on Plexicushion, a hard court. The French Open in Paris is played on clay. 

Grass is considered the fastest surface for tennis courts, and clay is deemed the slowest. Balls usually bounce higher on slow tennis court surfaces, and typically bounce lower on fast tennis court surfaces.  
Lines The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines. These are the boundaries used when doubles is being played. The line that runs across the center of a player`s side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. 
Shots There are eight main shots in tennis. These are considered the eight basic shots that must be mastered. They are the serve, backhand, drop shot, forehand, and half-volley, lob, overhead smash and volley. 

• The serve is the all-important shot which starts each point. While behind the baseline, the player throws the tennis ball into the air and smacks it into the rival’s service box without touching the net. An ambitious player may seek to get a winning shot with a serve rather than just starting a point. A winning serve which the rival player cannot return is dubbed an ace. 

• The backhand occurs when a player hits the ball with the back of the racquet hand facing the ball. 

• The drop shot occurs when a player gently taps the ball to give it just enough momentum to clear the net. This is a tactical move designed to outmaneuver and score on a rival who is away from the net. 

• A player makes a forehand shot by hitting the tennis ball with a move that starts from behind the body and is hit with the front of the racquet hand facing the ball. 

• A half-volley shot occurs when a volley is made after a short bounce. 

• A lob occurs when the tennis ball is struck in a high arc over the net and typically over the rival player’s head. 

• An overhead smash happens when a player hits a ball powerfully above his or her head. 

• A volley is a backhand or forehand shot hit before the ball bounces in the court.

Poker,"Poker Information Introduction It suddenly feels like the world is getting taken over by the game of poker. Though this is nothing new, there are a growing number of tournaments showing up. There are TV shows about how to learn to play poker and celebrity poker matches. Perhaps the popularity of the game has something to do with how quickly one can pick it up. It may also have to do with the great cash prizes that players can win if they master the game as well. This is a card game that people play in their homes, at tournaments for fun with friends, or at casinos. It’s easy to learn and makes for a fun card game, so it only makes sense that it’s been around for so many years.  History There is a rich history to the game of poker though it is heavily debated. There are some ancient roots to it though modern officials on the game will debate if they are in fact accurate. Since this is such a popular and beloved card game, people feel very passionately about the roots of it and how it actually came to be. There is definitely history to it as it is believed that early versions were played as early as the fifteenth century.




However the modern interpretation of the game can be traced to the 1800s. It was reported that in 1829 a version was being played with a deck of 20 cards and 4 players betting which hand was more valuable. A few years later the full 52 card english deck was introduced and the different hand types were expanded.
 
The height of the game seemed to come about in the 1970’s. Around this time, people started to play in notable tournaments and poker as we know it today became a phenomenon. People went from playing it in their basements to finding tournaments locally that they could participate in. Then came the evolution of poker games at the casino and even online versions of the game, and it all seemed to really take off from there. Now you can’t seem to go through a night of TV without a poker tournament being on. You definitely can’t walk through a casino without seeing several poker games going on. This richly historical game has evolved into something that is very mainstream, very popular, and most definitely here to stay. 
 Different Types of Poker and Hands
 Perhaps what makes poker so universally appealing is the fact that there are so many different types. This card game started out with just one type which is now known as straight poker. This is perhaps the easiest to learn and tends to form the basis for all of the other types. This game has been around for centuries and lends way to all of the different types out there. It seems that there is a type of poker that nearly everyone prefers and when one is selected as the game of choice, it tends to be that way for quite some time. The different types of poker are straight poker, stud poker, draw poker, and community card poker.

 There seem to be tournaments turning up for just about every type of poker these days. The most popular type of poker in recent years has been Texas Hold-Em, as this is easy to learn and fun to create a tournament off of. As testament to the fact that there is so much interest in the various types of poker, you are seeing video poker turning up at casinos and bars everywhere. Many people find that once they master one type of poker it’s quite easy to pick up another type, but there always seems to be a strong preference. There’s plenty to choose from and that’s what makes this such a preferred and popular card game.  Equipment

You can find these at nearly any game supply store and they are even sold in superstores nowadays as this is such a common game of interest.


Cards: A standard deck of cards is required to play this game, though many will use two separate decks of cards depending on the type of poker being played. This is easy enough to find as almost every store sells decks of playing cards. It’s always best to have a couple of extra decks of cards on hand, just in case a card goes missing or you have many people playing at once. 
Poker Table: Though this is certainly not a requirement, it’s a nice addition for a serious poker player. A simple card table can work, but if you plan on hosting tournaments or games often, a poker table makes it feel much more authentic. This mirrors what you would see in a casino and gets people into the right frame of mind. You can find poker tables at game supply stores and anywhere that you might buy card game equipment 
Dealer Button: Though you can make the game of poker work without a dealer button, it sure adds to the fun and authenticity. This is an essential part of the game as it ensures that the cards are dealt right and the game plays through. This and many other poker accessories can be found in game supply stores or online through a variety of gaming sites.  How and Where to Learn

This means you have to keep your bets low enough and be smart about the hands that you play

- Practice makes perfect: you’ve heard this old adage a thousand times, but it holds especially true in this game. It is a game of skill, a game of luck, and a game of great concentration.

Banjo,"Banjo Information  An introduction The banjo is an instrument used predominantly in bluegrass music. The most popular is the five-string banjo, although there are many variants of this instrument. Bluegrass banjo includes the essence of the banjo’s sounds and techniques. 

You need some skill and patience to master the banjo. If you already play the guitar, then you will probably find it easier to learn the banjo, since the chords are similar. While playing the banjo can look very easy, you do need practice to get those fingers to go exactly where you want. So let us get on with learning all about the banjo. 
The banjo’s music styles and usage Today, the banjo is commonly associated with Dixieland, country, folk, irish traditional music and bluegrass music. Historically, however, the banjo occupied a central place in African American traditional music, as well as in the minstrel shows of the 19th century. In fact, African Americans exerted a strong, early influence on the development of both country and bluegrass through the introduction of the banjo, and as well through the innovation of musical techniques in the playing of both the banjo and fiddle. Recently, the banjo has enjoyed inclusion in a wide variety of musical genres, including pop crossover music, indie rock (see Modest Mouse and Sufjan Stevens), and Celtic punk. 
Different banjo styles and techniques There are many styles of banjo music as well as banjo playing techniques. Depending on the style of music you intend playing, choose the right banjo. As a beginner, it is a good idea to listen to different banjo music styles to help you decide.  
Five string banjo for Bluegrass music This is the most popular and involves a banjo with a resonator. The right hand follows a three finger style played with finger picks. The credit for this style goes to the legendary Earl Scruggs. You need a lot of practice to perfect this style so that you can maintain the tempo. You will have fun jamming with other banjo players with this style, especially when you attend a Bluegrass festival.  
Clawhammer This one is an old style and popular with folk music lovers. You play this with an open back banjo that has no resonator, producing a mellow tone. The tuning is different to make it easy for easy finger work. No finger picks are used here. Your middle finger strikes the string with the back of your finger nail, then you do a thumb stroke of the fifth string. This is good fun when you sing along.  
Folk In the folk style, you mix Clawhammer or frailing with up picking. Pete Seeger was famous for this. Folk involves melody mixed with chords and like the Clawhammer, you don’t use finger picks. The banjo here is long necked and tuned lower to match vocal pitches. You can also use an open back or resonator banjo.  
Classical Style The classic style uses a five-string banjo without finger picks. This is a unique technique and you play classical music, for instance, Mozart, Beethoven, and so on. 
The types of banjos You will come across different types of banjos with four, five or six strings and several variants of the instrument. 

The six-string banjo is more for the guitarist who wants the sound of a banjo but the ease of playing the guitar. 

The four-string banjo is popular in Irish/Celtic music and Dixieland jazz/Ragtime music styles. You use a pick or a plectrum for both the four and six string banjos to pick out the tunes. 

The five-string banjo is the most popular with Bluegrass and the old style banjo music, but this is also being used in jazz and rock. This involves finger-picking the strings rather than using a plectrum. 

Whichever banjo you choose to learn to play, you can experiment with different music styles. After all, music is creative and you can certainly play rock with a 4-string banjo or Irish-style with a 5-string. 
Banjo variants A British innovation was the 6-string banjo, developed by William Temlett, one of England`s earliest banjo makers, who opened his shop in London in 1846 and sold banjos with closed backs and up to 7 strings and marketed these as ""zither"" Banjos from his 1869 patent. 

American Alfred Davis Cammeyer (1862–1949), a young violinist-turned banjo concert player, devised the 5/6-string Zither banjo around 1880, which had a wood resonator and metal ""wire"" strings (the 1st and 2nd melody strings and 5th ""thumb"" string; the 3rd melody string was gut and the 4th was silk covered) as well as frets and guitar-style tuning machines. 

A Zither banjo usually has a closed back and sides with the drum body (usually metal) and skin tensioning system suspended inside the wooden rim/back, the neck and string tailpiece was mounted on the wooden outer rim, the short string usually led through a tube in the neck so that the tuning peg could be mounted on the peg head. They were often made by builders who used guitar tuners that came in banks of three and so if 5 stringed had a redundant tuner. 

The banjos could also be somewhat easily converted over to a six string banjo. British opera diva Adelina Patti advised Cammeyer that the zither-banjo might be popular with English audiences (which was certainly true as it was invented there), and Cammeyer went to London in 1888. 

Due to his virtuoso playing he helped show that banjos could be used for more sophisticated music than was normally played by blackface minstrels, he was soon performing for London society, where he met Sir Arthur Sullivan, who recommended that Cammeyer progress from writing banjo arrangements of music to composing his own music. (Interesting to note that, supposedly unbeknownst to Cammeyer, William Temlett had patented a 7-string closed back banjo in 1869, and was already marketing it as a ""zither-banjo."") 

In the late 1890s Banjo maker F.C Wilkes developed a 6-string version of the banjo with the 6th string ""tunnelled"" through the neck. It is arguable that Arthur O. Windsor had much influence in creating and perfecting the Zither banjo and creating the open-back banjo along with other modifications to the banjo type instruments, such as the non-solid attached resonator that banjos` today have (Gibson lays claim to this modification on the American Continent). 

Windsor claims to be the first in creating the hollow neck banjo with a truss rod, and he buried the 5th string in the neck after the 5th fret so to put the tuning peg on the peg-head rather than in the neck. Gibson lays claim to perfecting the banjo with the tone rings. 

The first 5-string electric solid-body banjo was developed by Charles (Buck) Wilburn Trent, Harold ""Shot"" Jackson, and David Jackson in 1960. 

The six-string or guitar-banjo was the instrument of the early jazz great Johnny St. Cyr, as well as of jazzmen Django Reinhardt, Danny Barker, Papa Charlie Jackson and Clancy Hayes, as well as the blues and gospel singer The Reverend Gary Davis. Nowadays, it sometimes appears under such names as guitanjo, guitjo, ganjo, banjitar, or bantar. 

A number of hybrid instruments exist, crossing the banjo with other stringed instruments. Most of these use the body of a banjo, often with a resonator, and the neck of the other instrument. Examples include the banjo mandolin, the Banjolin, and the banjo ukulele or banjolele, most famously played by the English comedian George Formby. These were especially popular in the early decades of the twentieth century, and were probably a result of a desire either to allow players of other instruments to jump on the banjo bandwagon at the height of its popularity, or to get the natural amplification benefits of the banjo resonator in an age before electric amplification. 

Instruments using the five-string banjo neck on a wooden body (for example, that of a bouzouki or resonator guitar) have also been made, such as the banjola. A 20th-Century Turkish instrument very similar to the banjo is called cümbüs.   Rhythm guitarist Dave Day of 1960`s proto-punks The Monks replaced his guitar with a six-string, gut-strung banjo on which he played guitar chords. This instrument sounds much more metallic, scratchy and wiry than a standard electric guitar, due to its amplification via a small microphone stuck inside the banjo`s body. 
Getting started playing the banjo Now that you have a pretty good idea about the types and styles of a banjo, let us look at how you can get started with this enjoyable musical hobby.  
What will you need to get started? Obviously, you will need a banjo. Choose one based on the style of music you intend to play – this could mean Dixieland, Clawhammer or Bluegrass. 

Here are the types of banjos: 

• Open back banjos have a muted sound and are great when you practice or play by yourself or in a small group. • The resonator model projects the sounds and is ideal for a large audience. It has a clear sound and you get these banjos in many models where you can remove the resonator. 

The sound clarity of your banjo will depend on the number of brackets you use. These brackets hold the head on the pot assembly.  
How much will your banjo cost? How much your banjo costs will depend on its weight. Banjos that are less than six pounds are cheaper and range from $50 to $200. The heavier ones are more expensive and of better quality and these are upwards of $200, sometimes running to thousands of dollars. 

Don’t buy a banjo with a cast aluminum pot as they sound tinny. In fact, buy a banjo that feels good to your ears and fingers. Take someone who can play the banjo with you, so that you know what it sounds like.   Buy a good quality banjo and invest in one that will stay with you for years. A cheap one may not last long.  
Accessories for your banjo Apart from the banjo, you will need the following: 

Picks, especially if you intend playing Bluegrass. Buy thumb picks made of plastic and a couple of metal fingerpicks. Metal picks come in different gauges. Lower gauges are lighter. 

Straps, if you plan to play, standing up, to support your banjo, so that you can focus on playing. There is a variety of straps and you can choose the one you like. Remember to go for one that is wide, for better support. Get the right length as it can make all the difference to your playing. Tuning pegs that will allow you to tune your strings fast. You get Keith tuners, designed by Earl Scruggs and Bill Keith, which are considered the best tuners. 

You will need a good case for your banjo. Preferably go in for a hard case to protect your banjo. You will be happy you got it.  
Some other accessories you will need are: • An electronic tuner, pitch pipe or tuning fork (in G) so that when you tune your banjo you can refer to it. There are electronic tuners, but the tuning fork or pitch pipe, costs less. You choose what works for you. • A stand to hold your music and tablature. • A metronome to help you keep time. • A banjo bridge mute which goes over your banjo’s bridge to mute the sound. Some tunes need it. Also, if you have neighbors that object to your practice, these are handy. • Capos help to transpose keys, especially if you play with a group. Those who play the fiddle or mandolin play in A or B and you may need a capo for the bottom four strings of your banjo. You can take a Luthier’s help to put in the clips and spikes. You can also get a regular 5th string Capo that mounts on the side of the neck, letting you depress the fifth string with a sliding wire. It also helps you play in many other keys. 
Learning to play Armed with the right equipment and accessories, let us look at how you can learn to actually play. We can split the learning into three stages: 

First, you need to get an understanding of the musical structure which includes the scales, chords, tonal connections and tablature. This is something common to all kinds of music, regardless of whether it is bluegrass, jazz, classical or rock. So you need to learn basic music theory. 

Second, you need a ear for the music, so that you can grasp the theoretical concept. You need to perceive the pitch to practice. You can speed up this learning by singing your chords, scales and progressions. This will help build your skills. 

Third, based on your learning, it is time to apply the theory in practicing the banjo. This is the stage where you learn the finger positions and picking patterns to practice the scales, chords, etc. in all the twelve keys. You will need a lot of practice to learn and perfect the sounds and reach a stage where you play as you hear the music. 
How to learn to play? Most beginners wonder whether they can manage to learn to play the banjo without a teacher. Today, this is possible as you can use a computer to learn to play. There are instructional DVDs, books and CDs. However, the pleasure of learning from a banjo teacher one on one, is something else. You might want to surf the internet or ask your friends if they know of a teacher who can tutor you. 

Begin your banjo playing experience by learning how to sit in the most comfortable position and how to hold the banjo. If possible have someone who knows how to play the banjo with you to help you set it up. You will also initially need to learn to tune your banjo, how to add new strings when you need to, how to wear the finger picks, etc. There are good DVDs available that teach these. 

Your posture is critical to good playing. Hold your back straight with the banjo’s neck out at forty five degrees, so that it is perpendicular to the floor, resting on your thigh. Then rest your little finger next to the head of the strings to pluck them for Bluegrass. The plectrum should be between your index finger and thumb for a good grip to help you pluck the strings. 

There are banjo beginners’ videos available at music stores that help you learn the basics. After you learn the basics it is a matter of lots of practice and exploring the sounds. Play along with your favorite tunes to improve and impress your listeners. 
Some valuable tips As you become more proficient at playing the banjo, you will also need to learn to handle restringing your banjo, placing the bridge just right, checking the tension on the head, etc. Here are some tips to help you get better:  
Restringing your banjo First, you have to find the right strings for you. There are hundreds of manufacturers out there. Experience will help you choose the right ones. Strings come in different gauges like heavy, medium and light. The ones you will choose will depend on your banjo and also your playing style. Some people prefer to pick hard, while others go in for light strings. 

When you change your banjo strings, ensure that you replace one at a time. This is important because the bridge on your banjo’s head floats. So if you remove all the banjo’s strings, the head will fall off. It has to be placed perfectly. It is a good idea to mark the place of your bridge on the banjo head so that it is easy to align it again once you are done restringing or replacing. 

Also, when you restring one string at a time, you can maintain the tension on your banjo’s neck, saving on time spent retuning. 

As you wind your strings around the pegs at the top, wrap them securely. When you tighten the pegs, the top two strings, the first string D and second string B must point towards the floor. The bottom two, third string G and fourth string D should point at the ceiling in the playing position. The short G-string or the fifth string must be well trimmed and point so that you do not hurt yourself on it when you move your hand up and down the banjo’s neck.  
Maintaining your banjo strings Always keep your banjo free of dust so that no oil, grease or dirt sticks to the strings. Dirty strings can affect the sound of your playing. Follow the manufacturers’ instructions about when to replace your strings. As you become an expert, you can decide how frequently you want to change the strings. Some players replace them every 20 playing hours while others replace them every two or three hours. Some people prefer to wait until the string breaks. Banjo strings are not expensive and range between $3.50 and $5.50 a set. You can make your strings last longer by wiping your banjo, and particularly the strings with a soft cloth each time you finish playing. This can get rid of any oil or dirt that might stick to it before it builds up. Also, ensure that you store your banjo in its case when you are not using it.  
Placing your banjo bridge Your bridge must be located exactly right to strike the right note. Make sure that the twelfth fret is exactly half way between the bridge at the top of the neck and the bridge on the head. Measure it with a ruler if you like. When you play a note, its pitch should be one octave higher at the twelfth fret. Bridges can wear out and you may need to replace them, which is why you should know how to place them.  
Checking head tension Occasionally, you will need to check the banjo’s head. Suppose the bridge sags, you would need to tighten it with the help of the tool that comes with it. What you do is remove the resonator, if your banjo has one so that it does not get scratched. Then, tighten the brackets uniformly and carefully. Take care not to over-tighten it or it will break. Do it in such a way that the bridge is taut enough.  
Caring for your banjo wood Wax your banjo’s wood regularly with quality furniture wax. This protects the wood. 
In closing The pleasure of learning to play a musical instrument is hard to equal. The banjo, in particular is fun for the lively music you can play with it. Also, it is considered easier to play than most other instruments. As with any music, you need to practice a lot before you can play by ear. The tips and information above should put you well on your way to enjoying the wonderful banjo! Keep pickin’ and a grinnin’!",
Weight Training,"Weight Training Information  Introduction Weight training is a hobby for some, a passion for others, and a way of staying fit for still others. This is an aspect of fitness that is somehow overlooked, but it can burn calories like nothing else. Many people turn to it as a way of getting their bodies toned and sculpting their problem areas. No matter what your reason for turning to weight training, you want to be sure that you are going about it the right way. It’s important to approach each exercise safely and to carry it through the right way for the best possible results. This is a fitness craze that has caught on and is here to stay because people are recognizing just how effective it can be. 
Different Types It can feel overwhelming when it comes to which type of weight training to begin with and stick with. Much of this depends upon your goals and your objectives in your fitness and health. Some people start off with a simple type of training and build their way up. Some people find that they don’t really want to bulk up as much as maintain some tone, and therefore they stick with something a bit more focused on sculpting. Men often have different goals than women, and body type and stamina can also have a lot to do with the type of weight training you engage in. Perhaps it will help to break down the different types of weight training to understand how they stack up and what they help an individual accomplish. 

First there are isolation exercises, which perhaps is what most of us think of with weight training. When you think of what it takes to work out in the gym, your mind often goes to these types of exercises because it focuses on and actually moves only one joint or body part at a time. This is known as sot training by some and can be quite effective in working one part or muscle group at each workout. This is recommended by some personal trainers because it can ensure that you work out and exhaust one muscle group at a time. So you may go into the gym and work out just the arms one day, then let them rest as you go back the next day and work the legs. 

Recent recommendations tend to focus on compound exercises for the most effective workout. This is because they work more than one muscle group at a time and can therefore give you more bang for your buck. These exercises can be a bit gentler on the body because they work in the way that the body is meant to move through something like pushing or pulling. Compound exercises are good to go deep into an entire muscle group and work well at toning up. These two exercises are often used in conjunction for the very best results.   Free weights are something accessible for anybody to do anytime, and that’s what makes them so popular. As you saw in the history of weight training, it all started with primitive versions of free weights and these have been a constant in the fitness world. The nice part about these is that you can get them in the appropriate weight for your level and you can use them anytime, anywhere. You control the movements as opposed to fixed weight machines and that can be to your advantage, particularly if you are just starting out or working through an injury. There are great aspects to free weights and this is usually where most people start when they begin weight training. Some people tend to stick with them for that extra something in their workout routine. Free weights include dumbbells, barbells, medicine balls, sandbells, and kettlebells. 
Equipment As you have seen, there are many different types of weight training exercises and therefore there are many different types of equipment to go with each of them. If you go to a gym, then you will likely find a good mix of all types of equipment. Some people like to mix it up and incorporate some of the equipment at home and some at the gym. Whatever combination you utilize in your workout regimen, it’s important to know what type of equipment is out there. 

Free weights are so common that you can find them at just about any store. Though you only used to be able to find free weights at a sports equipment store, they are sold at megastores or even a super grocery store. They come in different weight denominations ranging from 2 pounds to over 20 pounds. It can be helpful to try them out in the store to see which works best for you and what feels comfortable to start with. Within free weights, there are dumbbells, barbells, and all sorts of other derivations. 

It can be wise to start with a lower weight and one that challenges you a bit without causing any potential injury. You can pay as low as $10 or less for a pair of free weights depending on where you get them. This is a great purchase because it’s something you can keep for life and you can utilize for various sculpting and toning, even after you build up your capabilities. Consider checking them out first at a store like Target so you can try out different weight levels and get the best value. Then build up as you see fit and as you gain strength. 

There are a number of weight machines out there that you can choose to purchase as well. Though this is not as common, there are stores that sell them if you are really into weight training and want this piece of equipment for your use at anytime. One of the most common weight machines is the weight bench. You can find these in sports equipment stores and even online. If you find a great sale you can snag one of these for your use at just under $200, but it helps to shop around. As there are so many weight machines out there, you can find everything from a resistance chair to a vertical leg press and even a machine built just for squats. Some people find that they can handle some of these weight training exercises without the machines. Others find that it’s more valuable to purchase a gym membership to utilize their machines whenever they want. You can purchase them for the home, but you are bound to pay more for this comprehensive type of machine. 

There are plenty of accessories that fall into equipment one may need for weight training. If you are planning to do some heavy lifting, then you may find that weight straps are an essential item. These types of straps for the wrist or the ankle help to transfer the weight appropriately and ensure that no injury is sustained. These can be purchased anywhere and have a minimal cost. They tend to be the most helpful for those who will be lifting heavier weights and who perform weight training on a daily basis. There are also weight lifting belts which you see serious weight lifters wearing quite often. These are meant to protect the back and provide a bit of extra support. Though there is still some discussion around the fact that they may work or not, they can work as a helpful piece of equipment if you have rather lofty weight training goals. 
How and Where to Learn For some people, weight training may feel a bit intimidating. Watching people lift heavy weights at the gym can scare them away from what should be a very helpful activity towards their fitness goals. The good news is that there is really nothing to fear because it’s easy to learn and just takes a bit of direction. It can be quite helpful to partner up with a fitness professional or trainer to learn how to work each weight machine and which types of free weights to use for the best possible results. 

There are plenty of videos out there that provide instruction on how to get involved in weight training. These can take a bit of the uncertainty out of the equation because you can learn in the comfort of your own home. It’s important to follow closely with the instructions given by the fitness expert on the video. Start slowly and don’t try to skip ahead because it can result in injury. These videos are great because they can provide a good workout as you learn what it means to lift weights. You will learn proper techniques and this will get you the results that you want and ensure that you stay clear of any injury. 

Many people find however that the best way to learn how to properly handle weight training is to sign up with a personal trainer. Even if it’s for a session or two they can help with instruction and customization. This normally happens at a gym or some type of fitness facility because it is centered on the weights and weight machines that are located there. The trainer will often ask you what your goals are and why you want to start including weight training as part of your workout. This is great because you can then work on the machines that best fit your needs and workout the muscle groups that you want to tone up. The trainer will not only help you to create a customized weigh workout, but they will show you firsthand the right movements. They will show you how each machine works and what settings are appropriate for your skill level. This will keep you safe and free of injury, and that’s an important aspect of weight training. 

Whether you learn at a gym, in a fitness class, or through an instructor led video, there are some great ways to go about attacking weight training. You will find that just a bit of instruction can provide you with some important confidence and that it keeps you free from injury, both of which are important in this type of exercise. You can learn at a local gym with a personal trainer, through videos that you can purchase or rent, or even sign up for a class that focuses on beginning weight training techniques offered at a local community center. 
Tips and Tricks If you want to maintain the very best workout, you want to ensure that you perform your weight training exercises with precision and safety always in mind. There are a few tips that can keep you free of injury, safe at all times, and of course get you that lean toned body that you are after. 

- Maintain Proper Form 

- Stretch and Warm Up 

- Control your Breathing 

- Stop if you are feeling pain 

- Another important aspect is to always stay hydrated to ensure that you don’t get fatigued. It’s best to drink plenty of water throughout your workout and then after to refresh properly. This is not only important to avoid hydration, but it also ensures that the muscles get what they need to avoid injury and to work properly after extensive use. Always keep a water bottle with you throughout your workout and take the time to drink in between reps. Drink plenty of water after your workout and you will find that you feel more energy and never risk injury, fatigue, or dehydration. 
Conclusion There are some fantastic benefits to weight training and we have gone through them. We have seen how history has played a role in shaping what weight training is today. We have also seen that this can be an extremely effective type of exercise if you want to tone up, get a lean body, and sculpt certain muscles. So long as you get proper instruction and learn the right and wrong ways to weight train, you will have great results. This is an important part of an exercise regimen because it can be the most effective at weight loss as well as toning. There are many different machines, pieces of equipment, and types of weight training to consider. Start slowly and build up your endurance and customize a weight training workout that gives you results and helps you to feel healthy and strong.",
Model Railroading,"Model Railroading Information  Introduction The term railway modeling is native to the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and Canada, but it the United States most people refer to this hobby as model railroading. It doesn’t really matter what you call it; the end result is the same. It is a hobby that involves modeling and building rail transportation systems on a small scale. The models hobbyists use include locomotives, rolling stock, streetcars, tracks, and signaling in addition to buildings, vehicles, model figures, lights and many other features including streams, hills and canyons. 

Model railroading is a very old hobby that dates as far back as the 1840s when it was called ""carpet railways."" Collectors began to see electric trains appear around the turn of the 20th century, but these early models had very little likeness to the real thing. Model trains have evolved greatly since their humble beginning, and modern modelers choose to create railways and layouts that depict real locations and specific periods in history. 
General Description Those who are involved in model railroading partake of the hobby in different ways. This may vary from just possessing a train set to serious hobbyists who spends many hours and substantial sums of money to erect a model that is an exact replica of a railroad including the scenery that it passes on his route (this is called the layout). Many of these hobbyists build models that are large enough for a person to ride. Many hobbyists also collect model trains and go to the trouble to build a landscape for the trains to pass through or they might operate a miniature railroad of their own. 

There are a variety of different layouts, and depending on the hobbyists these can vary from a stretch of circular or oval track to a replica of real places. If you have an opportunity to visit the Pendon Museum in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, you will discover an EM gauge model of he 1930s Vale of White Horse is under construction. The museum is also home to one of the earliest scenic models. Called the Madder Valley layout. John Ahern built it somewhere between the 1930s and late 1950s, and because of its realistic modeling it gained acclaim in magazines on both sides of the Atlantic. The oldest model village is Bekonscot in Buckinghamshire which is proud owner of a model railway that dates all the way back to the 1930s. The world`s largest model railroad is located in Hamburg Germany while the largest working steam layout is Train Mountain located in Chioquin, Oregon with 25 miles of track. 
Model Railroad Clubs If you are looking for model railroad clubs, you don`t have to go very far—they exist anywhere enthusiasts meet. Model railroad clubs display many of the different railroad models for the public to see and admire with one branch specifically focusing on larger scale models that usually operate on track gauges between 3.5 to 7.5 inches. These models are usually built by hand and operated by real steam or diesel-hydraulic. In fact, these models have engines with enough power to haul dozens of human adult passengers. Railways of these sizes are referred to as miniature railways. 

During the 1950s the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) engineered a model at MIT with automatic control of track switching. They accomplished this by using telephone relays. The oldest society, however, is The Model Railway Club that was established in 1910 and is located near Kings Cross in London, United Kingdom. It not only builds model railways, but it also has a collection of 5,000 books and periodicals. The Historical Model Railway Society is located at Butterfly near Derbyshire and specializes in historical events. It has archives that both members and non-members can access. 
Building from Scratch With all of the modern manufacturing techniques, it is possible to mass-produce models that still have an abundance of precision and realism. This used to not be possible, so building from scratch was a very common practice among enthusiasts and manufacturers. It was easy to make a simple model using cardboard engineering techniques while more sophisticated models require a combination of brass and temperature castings. 

Sometimes there were parts that required machining such as wheels and couplings, and in that case the hobbyist purchased the parts that he or she required. Even today etched kits are very popular and include low temperature castings. These kits allow the railroad modeler to build models that are not available from the major manufacturers as well as sizes that are available through mass production outlets. The introduction of laser machining techniques makes it possible to produce thicker materials for both steam and locomotive models. 
Control In the beginning both spring-drive and live steam locomotives ran until they no longer had any power left. It was impossible for the operator to stop and restart the locomotive or even vary the speed it was traveling. The arrival of electric trains in the commercial market in the 1890s changed all that because operators were then ale to control the speed of the train by simply varying its current or voltage. As time assed transformers and rectifiers entered the picture along with throttles that were more sophisticated. Trains that were powered by AC and DC power and had the ability to change direction or go into neutral gear soon followed. 

When trains began to use electricity for power it helped operators gain control because the electricity provided control because it divided the layout into different isolated blocks. This process allowed the train`s operator to slow or stop the train by simply reducing or stopping the power going to that block. It also meant operators could run multiple trains without having to be concerned about trains hitting one another because one is slower than another one. Another capability the blocks have is triggering signals or other accessories thus creating a sense of realism to the train and its layout. Those who operate three-rail systems quite often insulate one of the common rails on a particular piece of the track and then utilize the power from a passing train for providing the circuitry and activation of one of the accessories. 

Computers control most of the railways that are currently in operation. The common system that is commonly used as an industry standard is the Digital Command Control (DCC). The advantage of DCC is that it allows the operator to control individual pieces of equipment rather than controlling the voltage to the track like previous systems did. Since the modeler has the ability to control individual locomotives along the same stretch of track, it allows the layout to assume a more realistic operation. Some DCC decoders are able to generate sounds through a speaker that is hidden inside individual locomotive though less common proprietary systems are also in existence. 

Both radio control and DCC in the garden are commonly used for large-scale layouts, especially garden railways. 
National Model Railroad Association The National Model Railroad Association – or NMRA as it is commonly known—is an organization devoted to model railroaders. It promotes the idea of model railroading to the worldwide community through education and standards in addition to offering advocacy and fellowship among other railroad modelers. It allows those interested in the hobby of railroading to learn and communicate together in order for them to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to build the biggest and best model railroad layouts. Like any other hobby, the ability of being able to meet with other enthusiasts creates a type of camaraderie that in essence increases the love of the hobby. It also helps show others what each individual hobbyist is doing and allows those same hobbyists to not only learn new things but to develop relationships with other hobbyists and share experiences. 

Regional Focus: ""Steam on the Prairies"" Regional Convention 

The Thousand Lakes region had a total of 146 registrants for the ""Steam on the Prairies"" regional convention. The convention was held in Winnipeg, Canada and was the largest attendance the NMRA had seen in over five years. Attendees had their choice of a dozen different clinics and 20 layout hops. 

In spite of the large number of attendees, the weather was rather foul for the event and dumped a total of four inches of rain on the area during the weekend of the convention. The storm was totally unexpected and was the worst on record in 50 years! Mother Nature invoked a total of 13 hours of thunderstorms between Friday and Saturday that amounted to six months worth of thunderstorm hours in just one weekend turning underpasses in swimming pools, farmers` fields into lakes and uprooting tree. In addition there was flooding of over 1,000 basements, power outages throughout the city and mal-functioning traffic lights. It was certainly not a pleasant sight when you also consider that some of the pumping stations in the city failed and the Red River reached a height of over ten feet. 

In spite of all the rain and thunderstorms, attendees of the event enjoyed a fantastic view of the storm from the passenger cars of the Prairie Dog Central Railway. It is seldom possible to watch a thunderstorm of such magnitude cross the flat plains of the Canadian prairie. Attendees of the event also learned (sadly) that century old passenger cars are highly susceptible to leakage when it rains! 

The event was not a complete washout, and there were dry spells in those places of great importance with the rain stopping right before the scheduled extra fare excursion that arrived in Portage La Prairie and Lower Fort Garry. The sun also showed its face when attendees toured the Prairie Dog Central facility. Fortunately there was no rain on Sunday to interfere with the layout hops though there was more rain during the clinics when everyone was indoors. 

Unfortunately the barbeque at the Assiniboine Valley Railway on Friday night had to be canceled because even though the trains were still operational, the grounds were completely saturated. The plans for that event had to be changed to an indoor location, and thanks to the Canadian Mennonite University, it became a reality. They set up tables in their chapel rather quickly, which allowed the sponsors of the convention to move everything necessary for the barbeque to the campus quickly. The speed with which alternate arrangements were made allowed attendees to still ride the trains at the AVR. 

Once the Prairie Dog Central arrived at Warren, Manitoba attendees were able to tour a grain elevator. Because the elevator had an awning immediately over the station platform, they were able to remain dry when they exited the train. 

There was a banquet at the Hitch `N Post Restaurant—sponsors had hired chartered buses to provide transportation from the railway tracks to the restaurant so no one got wet in spite of the rain. Of course, it was necessary to cross a soggy gully in order to reach the restaurant from the highway, but the complaints ended once everyone reached the restaurant. 

Fortunately in spite of the unexpected and record-breaking thunderstorm, the event brought out a substantial number of entries for the model and photo contests. In fact, there were so many entries that it became necessary for the judging to enter into overtime! 

This event is just a sampling of the kind of fun and camaraderie that is likely to exist when railway modelers join the organizations that bring them together. It doesn`t matter what the weather is or where they may be, there is still the sense of belonging and or being together with others who share the same love of model train collecting and operating.",
Kung Fu,"Kung Fu Information  Introduction Kung Fu can be a very confusing and ambiguous term for those who are not familiar with it. It is difficult to classify it as a single or definitive martial art. Usually, the term is used to refer collectively to all of the Chinese martial arts. Kung was popularized, if not introduced, to the Western world by virtue of potion pictures from China. When Bruce Lee released “The Big Boss” in USA, the average American youth went crazy about flying over fences and dodging bullets. Anybody who enjoys watching these King Fu movies also longs to learn this extraordinary art form in some corner of his or her heart. 

There are countless forms and schools of martial arts in China. The most famous of them is the Shoalin style Kung Fu. These styles can be as old as time it; while some of them were recently founded by some extraordinary masters. Jeet Kune Do or the “Way of the Fist” is one of the most recently developed schools of Chinese Kung Fu. It was developed by Bruce Lee himself. 

Whatever be the style, Kung Fu is basically inspired by nature and quite often by the oriental mysticism. Most of the styles are based on the defensive and offensive movements of animals and insects. In many famous styles, such as the Drunken Style and Monkey Style Kung Fu, they employ unnatural movements to confuse your opponent and divert his or her attention to gain an advantage. Many forms of Kung Fu were developed by Buddhists and Taoist monks. Their main objective remains to achieve a higher level of spiritual consciousness apart from self defense. These Kung Fu schools are many centuries old and they often combine religious practices and teachings with the martial art training. For instance, practicing non-violence, vegetarianism and meditation forms an important aspect of Shaolin Kung Fu. 

Unlike some other Asian and Western martial arts, Kung Fu gives special attention to aesthetics. They like to flaunt their skills and to wave their swords beautifully, while they could have simply stabbed their opponent with the quickest technique. This aestheticism is something that makes Kung Fu more fascinating and it stands out from the crowd. Most of the people learn Kung Fu because they feel it gives them a boost in self esteem and confidence. Many people also learn to have an edge in their military or police career. A large number of people choose to join professional classes hoping to be able to represent their counties in international Wushu events. A very notable international event was held in Beijing in 2008 on the sidelines of the Olympic Games. Every student of this splendid martial art agrees with the fact that Kung Fu gives a sense of purpose to their lives. 
Some Major Types Of Kung Fu There are literally hundreds of King Fu styles in China. All of them are quite different from each other. For instance, some forms like Sanshou, resemble wrestling by allowing full body contact, some other forms like Drunken Monkey focus on avoiding contact and dodging the opponent. Usually these schools are divided into two main categories. These are commonly referred to as Internal Fung Fu and External Kung Fu.  
Internal Kung Fu: Some schools of Kung Fu are classified as internal because they focus on developing inner strength and moral qualities more than the physical aspects of fighting. The Chinese term for Internal Kung Fu is Neijia and is derived from a root meaning inner strength. The main objective of this type of Kung Fu is to gain an edge over your enemy by balancing your mind with your surroundings. With a relaxed mind you will be in a better position to anticipate the moves of your opponent and to take immediate pre-emptive measures. They’d like you to use your brain more than your limbs. Since their focus on brute force is somewhat secondary, they are often called Soft Kung Fu. 

There is also some mysticism associated with Sift Kung Fu. They believe that the body can be prepped for withstanding any attack - that would otherwise be hazardous – with careful manifestation of Qi or your soul’s energy. In many Internal Kung Fu styles, they claim to use their opponent’s Qi against himself or herself. 

These styles are usually taught at a very slow pace. This allows the students to understand even the minutest movement patterns and include them in their reflex memory as they are. Gradually they ask you to increase your speed. By the time you complete your training you will be in a position to execute these moves with explosive swiftness. 

This form of King Fu is best suited for people of small stature and small build. Big and tight muscles make it almost impossible to practice Internal Kung Fu. This is because it creates hindrances in easy and smooth movement of limbs.  
External Kung Fu: Many people believe that this is one of the easier ones to learn. Contrary to the above style, it focuses entirely on external body movements. There is little or no emphasis on berating and controlling Qi. The technique of External King Fu depends more on punches, blocks, kicks and weapons handling. While this is not a much romanticized version of Kung Fu, it is certainly very effective in real life and in games. 

Apart from the above stated, there are many other classifications of Kung Fu. They are usually based on religious or regional points of view. 
Some Major Schools of Kung Fu There are many Kung Fu styles that are accessible to Westerners in their own countries. Here is a brief description of some of them.  
Shaolin Kung Fu: Shaolin Kung Fu refers to a collection of Chinese martial arts that claim affiliation with the Shaolin Monastery. The Shaolin Temple is situated in the Henan province of China on a mountain amidst lush forests. Needless to say, Shoalin is regarded as a synonym for Kung Fu in the western world. According to a legend the Shaolin Kung Fu is the most ancient Chinese martial art. It is said to have been started by an Indian Buddhist monk who on a visit to the Shaolin Monastery was appalled by the inferior physical standards of the monks. Due to their physiological limitations they were not able to sit in meditation for long hours. The legend says that he then went into meditation for many years and then developed what is today known to the world as Shaolin Kung Fu. This happened as early as 550 AD. Over the years those styles and techniques were perfected and improvised by other masters.  
Wushu: These styles are primarily aimed at exhibition and competition, and often include more acrobatic jumps and movements added for enhanced visual effect compared to the traditional styles.  
Wing Chun: This is a very popular form of Kung Fu that is used in training a number of military and police organizations worldwide. This is mainly due to the fact that this form of Kung Fu trains you to handle offensive opponents from close range. Usually it is practiced without weapons. However, sometimes there is use of some close range bladed weapon. Wing Chun is basically a one on one close range martial art. It emphasizes on balance and technique, very much like western boxing. The aim of wing Chun is to dazzle the enemy with your swift and hard kicks and punches, while remaining at an advantageous position. 

Unlike many other forms of Kung Fu, Wing Chun is not about pre-choreographed moves for learning and practicing. Most masters would like you learn individual kicks and punches and then apply them as per your needs during combat.  
Drunken Monkey Drunken Monkey Pole Form of Kung Fu is a Chinese martial art, and one of the variations of the Monkey Style.  
Liu Seong Kuntao The Liu Seong System is one of the styles of Kuntao Silat, which are hybrid martial arts systems from the cultures of China and Indonesia. 
Famous Kung Fu Weapons Here are some of the most famous and reputed weapons sourced from the various disciplines of the Kung Fu.  
Wooden Staff: It is called “Gun” in Chinese. This simple weapon is one of the most dangerous weapons of Shoalin Kung Fu. It can be of varying length, weight and diameter. It can be as thick as a pole or as slim as your thumb. A “gun” is made by polishing wax wood that is very strong and flexible. Sustaining staff attacks without any adverse effect on body is one of the signature Shaolin preventative moves. 

The Shaolin monks prefer to call it the ‘Grandaddy of All Weapons.”  
Spear: It is called Qiang in Chinese. It was a signature weapon of all the Chinese armies, or at least such is the perception due to its depiction in motion pictures. It was used both by the cavalry and infantry. Unlike the accounts of some fantasy novels, the spear was rarely made from any other material except wax wood. 

To put this simply, Qiang is a staff with an added metal point. Another unique feature of Chinese spear is the addition of long red horse hair at the forward end of the weapon. This serves two purposes, to divert the opponent’s attention and to soak blood and prevent the weapon from becoming slippery.  
Double Dan Dao: It is the famous Chinese broadsword that you must have seen countless times on TV and in movies. It is not necessarily used as a pair but many Kung Fu students do prefer it. The real weapon is quite heavy and difficult to handle. However in practice and presentation they usually use a much lighter version that has thin steel or aluminum plate instead of a heavy and durable blade. It is needless to say that these lighter versions of Dao are sharp and lethal too. This is widely used in most of the Kung Fu styles.  
Jian: The jian is a double-edged straight sword used during the last 2,500 years in China. 
How to Learn Kung Fu There are many internationally certified and well trained masters (Shifus) in every country who teach Kung Fu for self defense. If you have no familiarity with Chinese martial arts, then you have no other option but to visit a master. However, if you have a decent knowledge of Kung Fu basics you can also depend on video lessons that are available on the internet. 

Alternatively, if you are dedicated enough, you can also learn Kung Fu from places like the Shaolin Temple itself. In fact there have been a number of foreign students in the Shaolin Temple. This will be a very extreme move on your part as life in the Shaolin Temple can be much more difficult than the training of elite armed forces. 

You can find a good master in your own city too. They need not be Chinese. A common perception is that masters of Asian origin have superior skills as opposed to others. This cannot be any farther from truth. Kung Fu has today evolved into an international martial art and ethnicity is no weighing scale for skills. 
Safety Considerations Kung Fu is a very lethal art and if you are not careful you can end up hurting, impairing or killing your opponent or even yourself. It is advisable that you do not practice anything without proper training and supervision. Some demonstrations that involve breaking iron bars and sustaining pointed weapons on delicate body parts are very dangerous and they should not be attempted by amateurs at all. Ensure that you are using all the safety equipments and that the weapons are blunt and non-lethal. 
Kung Fu as an International Sport The international Kung Fu Federation or IKF is the undisputed authority that is currently promoting the Kung Fu sporting events on an international level. Their objective is for Kung Fu to be recognized as an Olympic event. They are actively involved in promoting co-ordination and good will between various independent regional groups and authorizes worldwide. The IKF also promotes the training of Kung Fu as a sport and undertakes the development internationally recognized rules and regulations. Anybody can apply to become a member of the IKF for a nominal fee. 
Conclusion Kung Fu is a great way to stay healthy. Not to mention that you can deal with any adversities effectively when they arise. Learning Kung Fu can be especially desirable for you if you are looking forward to a career in the armed forces or in the security business. 

If you intend to take this up professionally as a sport, then you will have to choose your style and master carefully. Before seeking admission in any institution, you should confirm that it is recognized by the IKF. It would also be good to ask if any of their disciples have appeared in international tournaments in the past. 

Nevertheless, it is a great and a very indulging activity. It would be a great idea for you to join your kids and other family members every weekend. 

There is no age for starting Kung Fu practice. Many people start learning it in their later 50s and end up leading a healthier and happier life than what they could have imagined. So if you are also interested in learning this spectacular martial art, then you should go for it without any second thoughts.",
Rapping,"Rapping Information  Introduction Rapping is technically the ""spoken or chanted rhyming of lyrics"". The three different components of rapping are ""flow"" (rhyme and rhythm), ""delivery"", and ""content"". 

Rap was introduced to the rest of the world by people who were either African American or Hispanic in origin. The style of dancing which was connected to rap music was known as break dancing. Rap songs usually contain words and verses which are spontaneous. However a lot of critics in the world of music have stated that the advent of rap music in various walks of life has also propagated an onslaught of violent acts against women. 

Rap music has also been described as poetry which has been made available in the form of music. The lyrics of the songs have been adapted to the specific beat as well as the rhythm. The lyrics of most these rap songs are usually remembered by people since they have been used in order to convey a certain point of view or make people more aware about certain issues which are bothering people in certain parts of the world. Certain rap songs have also managed to trigger a large amount of violence and hatred among people belonging to various religious or race groups. 
The Seven cornerstones for learning Rap- Any person who has decided to learn rap will have to remember seven important tips or cornerstones which will be vital towards creating a successful mark in the world of Rap. 

The first and most important tip which needs to be remembered is that it is essential to pay equal importance to all styles of rap which have originated from the east coast, the west coast and also from the south. This will provide the person with the right kind of foundation or background which is needed on the different kinds of rhyming methods and schemes, the different terms which are used in the world of rap music and the different forms of flow and delivery which can be adopted in the various styles of rap. 

Every single aspect of every style of rap will have to be studied carefully in order to gain a clear understanding about each of them. Hence any person who would like to become proficient in the world of rap should make sure that he listens carefully to the various styles of rap music which are available. 

Music consists of many different songs which are made using different words. Hence any person who would like to make a mark in the world of rap music should also have a very remarkable vocabulary. The meanings of different words will have to be referred from a dictionary or a thesaurus and it is also important to have knowledge on words which have similar meanings or are synonyms. 

Rhyming is also a very essential component of rapping since most rap songs contain rhyming words. People in the field of writing rap songs should be aware of rhyming words which will prove to be useful in the creation and construction of rap songs. Dictionaries are also updated on a regular basis and hence it is also important on the latest words which have been entered into the dictionary. A list of rhyming words should also be made since this will be useful when new songs need to be created or when certain changes or alterations need to be made in the contents of a song. 

A lot of people who are entering the world of rap music for the first time and writing their own rap songs will usually find it difficult to get the whole process started in the right manner. They are likely to face a lot of doubts and obstacles at this juncture. At this point, they can try to prepare the chorus of the songs before creating the contents of the first paragraph or stanza of the song. The main idea behind the song will have to be conveyed through the chorus which has been created. Once the main chorus of the song has been created, the creation of the remaining parts of the song will become smooth and easy. 

Timing is another important aspect which needs to be given a lot of attention while writing rap songs. The right kind of instrumental beat should be selected in order to set the tune for a rap song. All veterans in the world of rap music will vouch for the importance of timing during the creation of rap songs. 

The person who is writing and creating the song should also be comfortable with the final product which has been created at the end. A lot of people decide to adopt a freestyle technique until they are able to establish a complete level of comfort with the lyrics which have been created. Some people simply create a simple sequence of random words which might not have any connection and try to make them rhyme and then adapt them to a specific kind of beat or tune. As the words are repeated time and again along with rhythm, changes and alterations can be made which will help in establishing the right flow for the words of the rap song. 

Examples of famous rap songs have always served as a good source of inspiration for people who are trying to create their own style of rap songs. They have helped many aspiring rap song writers in overcoming their writers’ blocks and they have also shown them many new avenues which can be adopted in order to improvise new rap songs which are being written. Hence it is essential for people to remember famous verses and lines from old rap songs in order to develop them and improvise them and use them in the right manner to create rap songs of their own. 

The process of recording songs will help people in understanding the final result which has been created in a much better manner. After the words of the rap song have been written and they have set to an instrumental beat and adapted to a tune, the song will have to be sang and recorded at least once. After the song has been recorded, it will have to be replayed for the person to understand the effect which is created by the song when it is being sung. It will help him in identifying and isolating the different areas where changes have to be incorporated. It is not necessary to make use of any kind of expensive equipment in order to record songs and listen to them during the initial stages. The simplest and cheapest microphones along with the simplest forms of recording equipment will definitely serve the purpose. 

The introduction of rap music has also influenced many other fields in the world of entertainment namely films. Rap has also become a very essential ingredient in the world of pop music. A lot of advantages can also be found in rap music since they also have a large amount of artistic value. However, only people with a clear eye for art will be able to decipher the artistic value in the rap songs which are being created all over the world today. A lot of rap songs are being made in different parts of the world these days and it is impossible to find any artistic meaning in every single song which is being created. 
How to improve the quality of your rap A lot of new players have now entered the world of rap music and they have also started creating tough competition for the already existing players in the rap world. Hence singers and groups who have already been present in the world of rap will have to find ways of improving the quality of music which is being created by them in order to stay ahead of the latest competition which has cropped up. 

The first step which needs to be taken by them is to keep their confidence levels upbeat in order to counter the new entrants in the field. A song which has completely mismatched words can be sung with complete confidence in order to make it a huge hit. Hence it is extremely important for every rap singer and artist to keep his level of confidence intact in order to stay on top of the existing competition as well as the upcoming competition. 

Every rapper should make sure that he listens to himself singing at least once before making anyone else listen to his song. The amount of confidence which exists in the mind of the rapper should be reflected in the right manner in the content of his song. After the songs has been composed and then set to some instrumental beats and tunes, the person should sing the song to the tune and get it recorded using simple recording equipments. This will help him in understanding the effect and impact which is being created by the song when it is sung. 

Different kinds of words are used in order to create a rap song. Hence any good writer of rap songs should have a very strong command over the English language as well as a strong vocabulary so that he can write many different songs. Awareness regarding a broad range of topics is also required in order to able to write good quality songs. This awareness will enable a lot of song writers to connect to their audience by creating songs which are relevant to a lot of important issues taking place all over the world. 

Beat boxing is a very important asset which should be available with every rap song artist. The presence of the beat boxing will help in maintaining the beat throughout the length of a song and it will ensure that the singer does not lose the beat at any specific point in time. Many famous rap artists are always accompanied by a professional beat boxer whenever they are travelling for a concert or undergoing the stage of composing and creating a new song. Rap artists who are unable to gain access to a good quality beat boxer can decide to acquire a simple beat machine which will serve the same purpose as that of a beat boxer. 

Rap artists who have just entered the world of rap music can learn a lot from veterans who have been in the field of rap music for long periods of time. They should listen to all the rap songs which have been composed and sung by famous rap artists from different parts of the world and try to understand the element of specialty which exists in all these songs. This will also help them in understanding the various styles which exist in the world of rap music. The subtle elements of rap music can be understood well in this manner. 

Once new rap artists have managed to gain a better understanding of the various elements of rap music as well as the various styles of rap music, they will be able to create and develop their own individual style of rap music. People can develop their own individual style by improvising on styles and elements which have been derived from music which used to be played during the previous generation. This will also help the audiences to differentiate them from the various rap artists who exist in the world of rap music. 
Freestyle rap Freestyle rap comprises the specific field of rap music where poetical words are set to a specific instrumental beat or music. Freestyle rap is something which can be composed on the spur of the moment. Organized planning and preparation is not needed in order to create songs under the banner of freestyle rap. The person singing the freestyle rap song will keep composing the lines as he is singing. However a strong vocabulary is required in order to compose songs, which come under freestyle rap. This will help in creating songs which have rhyming words. A good knowledge of the English language will help the composer to find words which rhyme and which can also convey the intended meaning. It is also a good idea to write down certain pairs of rhyming words which will be useful for creating any more rap songs in the future. Beats are also an important aspect which needs to be taken care of while creating a freestyle rap songs.",
Chess,"Chess Information  Introduction Chess is a great game that just about anyone can play. Age is not an issue; whether you are young or old, chess is a game that is not only mentally stimulating, but also brings a lot of benefits. It is a game that develops focus, concentration and logical thinking. Because of its complex moves and the goal of the game, you will gradually start recognizing patterns. As with any game, winning is the motive and reaching this goal is an exciting process. Chess has specific rules that you are required to follow and when you get better at the game, you will gradually see that the learning is lifelong. Chess gives you a lot of scope to be creative as well as inventive with its infinite number of combinations. Let’s get started. 
Chess – the game Chess is a board game played between two players. It is played on a chessboard, that is a square-checkered board with 64 squares placed in an eight-by-eight grid. Each player starts controlling sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent`s king, where your opponents king is in check and there is no way for your opponent to remove or defend it from attack on the next move. 
Getting started with playing chess Now that you have the full background about how the game of chess evolved, it is time to look at what you need to get started to play.  
What you need It is easy to find a chess set of your choice. Chess sets can be priced as low as $10.00 and go up to several thousands of dollars based on the type you buy. They come in different themes, materials, shapes and sizes. Your chess set can be as decorative or as practical as you want. 

As a beginner, you might want to invest in a sturdy plastic set that will stay with you for some rigorous practice, since most people who start learning chess tend to get addicted to the game. You can buy a chess set online easily, choosing from different types of chess pieces and boards. 

You can even play chess on your computer with a chess program. However, it does feel good to have a physical set that you can spend time with. It all depends on your comfort level.  
How to learn, where to learn There are several options open to you to learn chess. You can enroll at your local hobby club if you have one nearby. You can also learn from chess software, electronic chess sets, from a DVD or from books. 

Computers are accessible to everyone and these days, most beginners get started playing against computers rather than with human players. It is a good idea to browse chess sites. Some of them offer free online lessons with an option for paid advanced lessons. You can play live games on some sites with opponents across the world. If you wish you can also invest in chess videos that teach you to play chess right from the opening moves to the end game. 
How to play
Chess pieces – rules for movement Each chess piece moves in a different manner. No piece can move through another piece, although the knight can jump over other pieces. No pieces can move on to a square occupied by one of their own pieces. But they can be moved to replace an opponent’s piece that can be captured. The chess pieces are mainly moved to positions from which the opponents’ pieces can be captured. Moves are also defensive, guarding their own pieces or controlling important squares. 

White always moves first. After the first move, the players alternate and move one piece at a time. Pieces can be moved to an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent`s piece, capturing it and removing it from the game. Now let us look at how each individual piece moves: 

The King is the most important piece on the chess board. However, he is also the weakest. You can move him only one square at a time, in whichever direction – be it up, down, sideways or diagonal. You cannot move the king into check as he will be captured in this position. The king moves one square in any direction. 

The Rooks are especially powerful when they are working together and you use them to protect each other. The rook can move any number of squares along any rank or file, but may not leap over other pieces. Along with the king, the rook is also involved during the king`s castling move. 

The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but may not leap over other pieces. Each bishop begins on one color and must stick to that color. Bishops cover up each other’s shortcomings and coordinate well together. 

The Queen, unlike the king, is the most powerful. You can move her in any one straight direction, for as far as possible. She cannot be moved through any of her own pieces. If you use the queen to capture an opponent`s piece, her move is over. The queen combines the power of the rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along rank, file, or diagonal, but it may not leap over other pieces. 

The movement of the Knights is different from the other chess pieces because they move two squares in one direction, and then another at a 90 degree angle, in the shape of an “L”. This means the knight moves to any of the closest squares which are not on the same rank, file or diagonal, thus the move forms an ""L""-shape two squares long and one square wide. The knight is the only piece which can leap over other pieces. 

Pawns are unusual chess pieces. They can move and capture by moving forward but capturing diagonally. A pawn cannot move or capture backwards and neither can they move past or capture another piece directly in front of them. The pawn may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it may advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied, or it may move to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece, which is diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that piece. 

Pawn Promotion 

Pawns have the exclusive right for “Promotion.” If the pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it can become any other chess piece. This is called promotion. It is usually promoted to a queen. 

En passant 

En passant, which means “in passing” in French, is another special rule for pawns and this can sometimes make the difference between winning or losing the game. 

En passant can only happen when a player uses his option to move his pawn two squares on its initial movement. When she does this, her opponent has the option to capture the moved pawn “en passant” as though it had only moved one square. This option is available for only one move. 

Castling 

Castling is a special defense move that can be used only once and the only move where you can move more than one piece during your turn. It is a great strategy to bring a powerful rook into play, especially when it is restrained behind a wall of pawns. This move lets you gain two vital advantages in the same move: - make your king safe, and release your rook to come back into the game. You can move the king two squares over to one side and then move the rook from its corner placing it right next to the king on the opposite side. Castling has four conditions and they are: 

- Castling can happen only if there are no pieces between the king and the rook - Neither king nor rook should have moved from their original position, which means it should be their first move in the game. - There must be no opponent’s piece that can capture the king in his original position, or the square he moves through or the square where he ends up in. This means, the king should not be in “check” or pass through check. 

If you observe keenly, you’ll see that when you castle in one direction, the king gets closer to the side of the board and this is called kingside. When you castle to the other side through where the queen is positioned, it is called queenside. No matter which side you move him, the king moves two squares during castling.  
Check and Checkmate The main goal of a game of chess is to checkmate the king of your opponent. This can happen only when the king is in check position and cannot get out of it. A king can get out of check in three ways: 1. Move out of the way (no castling here, though) 2. Block the check with another piece 3. Capture the piece that threatens the king If the king still cannot escape checkmate, it’s the end of the game. 
Strategy and tactics
Beginner’s basic strategy As a beginner, there are four basic strategies you need to bear in mind: 

Protect your king at all times. Maneuver your king to safety, to the corner of the board. Don’t delay castling, when you get the chance to do it. Use the castling strategy as soon as you are able to regardless of how close you are to checkmating your opponent. The game is over if your king is checkmated first. 

Don’t give your pieces away by losing them because you were careless. Each one of your pieces is precious, and you need all of them to checkmate. Keep track of your pieces by assigning them a value. This may help: 

Pawn – 1 Knight - 3 Bishop – 3 Rook – 5 Queen – 9 King – priceless 

Of course, when you reach the end of the game, the points don’t carry any value, but it certainly helps to assign values during the game, since it helps you plan your moves. 

Control the center of the board using your pieces and pawns. When you do this, you get more room to move your pieces, making it tough for your opponent to move easily. 

Make sure you use all your pieces. Develop your pieces’ positions so that you have them around when you try to attack the king. 
Some tournament rules you should know Here are a set of common chess tournament rules: - If you touch one of your own pieces, you have to make a legitimate move with that piece. - If you touch your opponent’s piece, you have to capture it. - If you want to touch a piece only to adjust it, you must say “adjust” before you do it. 
Chess - Starting a Game Your chess game will consist of three stages: - Chess opening, where you and your opponent bring out your pieces and get ready to compete - Middle game, which begins as you and your opponent maneuver for the right position and perform your defense and attacks - Chess endgame, when there are usually fewer pawns or pieces on the chessboard and when it is considered safer for the Kings to join the battle. 

It all begins with arranging the chess men. The chessboard is arranged so that each player has a white/light color square in the bottom right hand side. The chess pieces are arranged the same way each time. The pawns are arranged in the second row. The rooks are in the corners, with the knights next to them, followed by the bishops and then the queen, who is placed on a matching square. A white queen is on a white square and a black queen on a black square. The King occupies the remaining square. 

White plays first. You can decide who gets white with a coin-toss, or guessing the color of the piece hidden in your hand. White makes the first move, followed by the opponent who plays black, then white and so on until you reach the end of the game. 

As you enjoy your journey with chess, you will also come across several variations of the game where you can play with different boards and pieces with different rules. More than two thousand variants of chess are known. Examples are the Chinese Xiangqi and the Japanese Shogi. There is a version called Chess 960 where you choose the initial position by randomly selecting one from 960 starting positions. This can be quite challenging and exciting.

Wine Making,"Wine Making Information  Introduction Wine making can be, like any hobby, very rewarding. But this hobby can be costly and one that might need you to have a great deal of room and materials. Before choosing to invest time and money in this hobby it is important to make sure that wine and wine making is something that you truly have a lasting interest in. Many people who start off making wine as a hobby move on to selling their wine locally, so you can have this as a possible long term goal in mind. 

There are books and websites that can help you get more information and help with the wine making process, as well as help you to locate where to buy all the necessary tools and materials that you might need to advance your hobby. Taking a look at these sites before you start investing into the hobby can give you an idea of what you are getting into before the costs begin to add up. It is also important to note that wine making does not happen overnight and depending on how long you leave the wine to ferment, it could be months before you taste your first batch. 
Process In traditional wine making the process is as follows: 

After the harvest, the grapes are crushed and allowed to ferment. Red wine is made from the must (pulp) of red or black grapes that undergo fermentation together with the grape skins, while white wine is usually made by fermenting juice pressed from white grapes, but can also be made from must extracted from red grapes with minimal contact with the grapes` skins. Rosé wines are made from red grapes where the juice is allowed to stay in contact with the dark skins long enough to pick up a pinkish color, but little of the tannins contained in the skins. 

During this primary fermentation, which often takes between one and two weeks, yeast converts most of the sugars in the grape juice into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. After the primary fermentation, the liquid is transferred to vessels for the secondary fermentation. Here, the remaining sugars are slowly converted into alcohol and the wine becomes clear. Some wines are then allowed to age in oak barrels before bottling, which add extra aromas to the wine, while others are bottled directly. Still others may be aged in stainless steel tanks or glass carboys. The time from harvest to drinking can vary from a few months for Beaujolais nouveau wines to over twenty years for top wines. However, only about 10% of all red and 5% of white wine will taste better after five years than it will after just one year. Depending on the quality of grape and the target wine style, some of these steps may be combined or omitted to achieve the particular goals of the winemaker. Many wines of comparable quality are produced using similar but distinctly different approaches to their production; quality is dictated by the attributes of the starting material and not necessarily the steps taken during vinification. 

Variations on the above procedure exist. With sparkling wines such as Champagne, an additional fermentation takes place inside the bottle, trapping carbon dioxide and creating the characteristic bubbles. Sweet wines are made by ensuring that some residual sugar remains after fermentation is completed. This can be done by harvesting late (late harvest wine), freezing the grapes to concentrate the sugar (ice wine), or adding a substance to kill the remaining yeast before fermentation is completed; for example, high proof brandy is added when making port wine. In other cases the winemaker may choose to hold back some of the sweet grape juice and add it to the wine after the fermentation is done, a technique known as süssreserve. 

The process produces wastewater, pomace, and lees that require collection, treatment, and disposal or beneficial use. 

For wine making hobbyists the process is much the same but on a much smaller scale. Many hobby wine makers will even purchase kits or premade juice in order to make their wine. This saves them the trouble of having to grow and prepare their own grapes. This is a good option for beginners because it allows them to experiment in the wine making process without having to worry about properly growing the grapes and juicing them. Many hobbyists do not have the land nor the ability to properly harvest, destem and crush the grapes. 

But hobbyists do use yeast and they do ferment the wine twice before ensuring that the wine is ready to drink. Different additives can also be put in order to give the wine different tastes and flavors. There are plenty of online resources offering great recipes so that you can make a wine that suits your personal tastes. 
Equipment When you are preparing to set up your own wine making hobby there are a number of different tools that will make the process much easier. There are two main types, the tools that can be reused and the tools that can only be used once. Many of these items you will need multiples of and they can vary in price based on where you get them from. 

• 1 gallon glass jars, some people will use larger jars and others will even choose to use plastic. The decision is yours but be aware that many people feel that the plastic can affect the taste of the wine. 

• Airlocks, you will need one of these for each glass jar that you purchase. 

• Siphon Tube, about six feet. 

• Corks and Wine bottles, this one probably seems pretty obvious but it should not be overlooked. 

• Wine Yeast, this is necessary for fermenting 

• A bucket, 

• A sieve, or mesh bag, the finer the better. 

• A Kettle.   This is the minimum of what you will need in order to make wine. But there is a number of other tools that you may choose to purchase as you become more involved in the wine making process. 
Recipes All wines have a specific recipe that creates their unique and specific flavor. You can even combine other flavors with the flavor of the grapes. There are a number of sites that offer free recipes and information on how to find and prepare the ingredients that you need. For example for a Blackberry wine the recipe includes fresh black berries and information on how to pick them and prepare them for use in the wine. 
Appreciating Wine Wine making as a hobby can only be useful if you are aware of how to appreciate a good wine and enjoy drinking it. Part of the process of learning to appreciate the different flavors and styles of wine is to learn how to truly taste the wine.",

Automobile Restoration,"Automobile Restoration Information  Introduction Auto restoration is the process of rebuilding an automobile that is one of many stages of disrepair and bringing it back to the life and luster than it exhibited when it was new. From classic cars to modern automobiles, auto restoration covers the entire gambit of all vehicles that were ever manufactured. 

The idea behind auto restoration, however, is to revive cars that have some level of value, whether monetary in the public eye, nostalgia for a forgotten era, or for personal reasons, such as the first date car for a couple who are now celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary. 

Auto restoration is not for the faint of heart as it requires an incredible amount of time, patience and money, from acquiring new parts to having upholstery refinished to look like new, to meticulously taking apart and then rebuilding an engine, which can require many months to complete. 

To start with an auto restoration, it isn’t incumbent that the individual be a mechanic or have a vast working knowledge of automobiles or auto repair. Some people merely hire out the help they need, or purchase books that guide them through each phase of the particular restoration process, or have friends come over to help out at various stages. 

Auto restoration can unite communities, it can bring together families, and it can help bridge the gap that sometimes exists between the past and the present. Some automobile aficionados will tell you that cars from yesteryear were much simpler, that the components and technologies used are easier to work on, repair, and replace. Others will argue that today’s cars, with their computer monitoring equipment and such make it much easier to repair. 

However, cars of today have managed to fit more into tighter spaces, making any actual work of auto restoration more of a challenge to the patience and the person doing the work. Yet, throughout the world, there are diamonds in the rough all over the place; cars and trucks lying dormant, rusting away in a field or off to the side of a house, relics of a forgotten age just waiting to be given life and brought back from the edge of despair. 

For anyone looking to tackle an auto restoration project, the road is not an easy one, but if the passion is there, it can be achieved. For those lucky souls who have stumbled upon a rare and valuable car that has long passed its prime, restoring it could lead to windfall sale when, and if, it is completed properly. 
Reasons for Auto Restoration There is basically only one kind of auto restoration, and that is complete one. But there are different reasons for doing a restoration. As mentioned earlier, some people make an investment in a classic automobile that they believe will be worth a significant amount of money if they spend the time to bring it back to its original look and operation. 

Other people want to restore cars in order to learn more about them. Taking something completely apart and repairing those individual components and then putting it all back together certainly can teach a person far more than any amount of reading or watching video instruction will manage. However, it’s important to remember that you should have someone on standby who is experienced and can help should you find yourself in a difficult situation. 

Another type of restoration project entails a recent accident. Whether the car was listed as totaled by the insurance company or just has some damage to the front end or other parts of it, a full restoration could mean getting back the car the person had before the accident, or even bringing it back to its original showroom condition. 
Safety When it comes to auto restoration, safety is perhaps the biggest concern. Having the right equipment is critical to being safe. Having plenty of room in which to work is also very important to overall safety. Working on a car in tight quarters can lead to many unnecessary accidents and mishaps. 

Have plenty of lighting. Work lights, especially those that can be moved into place where needed, are vital to being able to see precisely what you are working on and what needs to be done. Have more than one light so that you have flexibility, as well as the ability to see clearly. 

When removing the engine or other heavy parts, don’t use makeshift devices. Spend the money and purchase the right equipment, such as an engine lift, jacks, jack stands, and, if necessary, a transmission stand. These will not only help you to avoid injury, such as pulling back muscles or breaking an arm, but they will also protect the sensitive components of the car itself. 
Equipment to Have Having the right tools makes any job much easier and more efficient. For an auto restoration, the right tools are numerous, but they don’t all need to be purchased at once. Instead, they can be gathered as you move through the entire restoration project. 

The first thing, and perhaps the most critical piece of equipment to have isn’t really equipment at all, but rather a safe, dry, flat surface to store the car. Since the chassis (the main frame of the body) will not move once you park the car to begin the auto restoration, this will remain where it is for a considerable amount of time. Storing it outside under a tarp may seem like a fine idea at first, but when you begin to put the pieces back together, you will find that having it in a safe, warm, and dry area is much safer and much more efficient. 

Next you will need the proper tools. Depending on the type of vehicle you plan to restore will determine whether you need American or metric tool sets. American made cars more than twenty-five years old will almost exclusively require American sets, but the modern cars from American manufacturers are often built in pieces from other countries and could require both. The best solution is to purchase quality tools of both sizes. 

When you plan to do a complete auto restoration, don’t cut corners when it comes to your tools. Buying cheap tools will only mean, in most cases, that you will break one or more and need to buy new ones along the way. 

Jack stands, car jack, engine lift, and a transmission lift will all be crucial tools to have when you begin the restoration project. You can use cinder blocks or other sturdy devices that can hold the chassis up in the air when you remove the wheels, but just remember, you will be underneath the vehicle many times and you should want to feel safe and protected by having jack stands that are rated for the full vehicle’s weight. 

Lights. Make sure you have plenty of light when you work on this car. Having more than enough light is always better than not having enough. Besides, when you are working on some components of the restoration, you will be moving back and forth between different parts of the car and therefore it’s advisable to have light at every point so you don’t have to waste time moving one. Whenever you have to spend too much time on other things beside the restoration, it can be easy to call it quits and give up. 

Bolt breaking spray, lubes, and fluid pans. Bolts in old cars will rust and freeze. Having a spray that breaks these rust points is a great time saver and will help reduce the chances of snapping bolts and then requiring drilling to remove them. Oil, transmission fluid, and radiator fluid, along with gasoline are just some of the fluids that will have to be removed and discarded safely. Dumping any of these fluids down a drain, into a storm drain, or into the ground is a violation of environmental laws and are punishable by massive fines, cleanup costs, and potentially prison time. 
How to Learn People learn a great deal about auto restoration simply by doing the work themselves. There are also classes in local community colleges and adult education programs that teach the mechanics and fundamentals of performing work on automobiles. One can also find a number of groups and organizations around the community of other auto restoration enthusiasts to speak with, gather tips, and to also find the right professionals to whom to bring major projects that are part of the total restoration. 

Remember, there will be the need for professionals to repair or replace certain components, such as seat re-upholstering, to name just one. Having a network of individuals who can point you in the right direction will go a long way toward facilitating the total restoration. 

Reading books on car repair is another great way to improve one’s knowledge base. There are many wonderful books on the subject and one can even find specialty repair books specific to the model car that they plan to restore. 

Learning is a process and there will be times when you make mistakes. The key is to minimize the damage caused by those mistakes. It is certainly better to make those mistakes when taking out the parts of the car than when you begin to reassemble it. 

When you’re ready to put the car back together, the most sensitive aspect is the engine and transmission. It’s advisable, if you don’t have the proper experience to handle this aspect, to call on some experience help and guidance, even if you have to hire a mechanic to come to your home or wherever you’re storing the car to assist you. It’s also a wonderful way to learn from one-on-one direct assistance. 
Tips and Tricks Aside from the most basic and fundamental tips that are shared in previous sections, auto restoration should be fun and exciting. Perhaps the most important tip to offer is that this will not be a fast process. There will be plenty of times when nothing seems to go right and you will want to give it all up. These are the moments when passion for the end result and the love of automobiles will be most important. 

If possible, it’s a good idea to have a sink with a catch drain nearby the work area as some components will need to be cleaned of oil and grease residue that could have built up over the years. As a result of cleaning and degreasing, small parts, such as screws, springs, and other components could fall from the unit and drop into the sink. Having a catch drain will help to avoid minor mistakes from becoming costly. 

Have a telescoping magnet on hand. While this might fall into the realm of equipment, it’s actually considered an extra, non-necessity, but one that is used by countless mechanics around the world. A telescoping magnet is perfect for snagging loose screws and bolts and nuts that happen to slip into narrow crevices in the chassis, places that can either not be seen or reached by hand. 

The most important tip is to have fun and look for any opportunity to bond with friends or family during the phase of the auto restoration. Not only will the end result bring you great joy, but the process will be chock full of memories that can last a lifetime. 
Conclusion Auto restoration has never been about experience working with cars, but rather a love of a fine automobile and wanting to see its rusty, broken down body shine like new again. There are certain considerations to be made when it comes to restoring an automobile, such as determining whether you wish to maintain its highest resale value or if you’re only restoring it for personal posterity. 

In order to retain the highest market value, a car’s engine and transmission must remain original. Putting in a new transmission, or one that doesn’t match the car’s TIN (Transmission Identification Number) will reduce the overall value of the car. 

Beyond that, just take your time and enjoy the process. There is a great deal to learn about cars and auto restoration is one of the best ways to go about learning.",

Videos, often by famous guitarists themselves, are also very helpful, because you can get a live demonstration of guitar secrets and better your own act. The internet of course has a plethora of information to offer, be it advice, riffs, videos and anything else you might need to learn how to play the guitar.  
Equipment When you`re buying your first guitar, don`t be lazy and simply pick up the first one you come across on the internet. Go to a music store and take a look around before settling on one. While prices are important, don`t base your decision simply on how much it costs. Of course a cheap guitar is fine to begin with; you won`t need the fancy features initially. But as you get better at it, you will want to upgrade to better models which offer more advanced features. If you don`t know what to do when you get to the music store, tell the shop assistant what you need and he may be able to help you.  
Classes and Community Lessons Classes are the best way to learn any instrument. While some classes may be free, most charge a fee for their teachers and equipment. However they`re all equally good.

Practice Makes Perfect As cliché as it sounds, this age old saying holds true for any instrument. To perfect your skills, more than anything else, you just need to continue practicing. You need to enjoy playing before anything else. Your enjoyment and a desire to perfect yourself will push you to keep practicing. But you need to keep in mind that you mustn`t force yourself to keep playing. Music is all about passion, and you must keep playing only as long as you enjoy it.  
Appreciation is Important While practice is important, it`s also equally important to be appreciated for all our efforts. So when you think you`ve practiced just about enough, and can`t bear to hear yourself again. Stop! Go find someone who`s willing to listen and play something for them. Everyone loves music and they`re bound to enjoy what you play for them. Watching them enjoy themselves is definitely going to give you an ego boost and also an added rush which will encourage you to keep playing better. 

Keep these tips in mind and keep practicing. There`s no limit to how good you can get. Happy Guitaring!   
Lesson 2 - How to Choose and Buy the Best Beginner When you`re a beginner, it`s always hard to figure out exactly which guitar you should buy, and how much you should pay for it. Of course, judged from an expert`s point of view, these are just a few factors. There may be many more factors worth considering before settling on the ideal beginner`s guitar. Here are some tips you could keep in mind when you`re thinking of buying a guitar.  
Tips For buying A Beginners Guitar Buying the right guitar is not an easy job. It can be tiring, frustrating and at times you`ll feel like buying the next guitar you see, just so that you can stop looking for one. Or worse, you could feel like giving up the idea of learning the guitar altogether. Each individual has a different set of criteria to buy the perfect criteria, and you might not always be able to satisfy all of them at once. The most important thing to remember while buying a guitar is PATIENCE. You will get the right guitar, just have a little patience, and look around as much as you can. 

Research well, before you settle for a guitar. Don`t just buy the first guitar you see. The web offers you plenty of information. Take a look at it. Visit as many music stores as you can, just to get an idea of what`s on offer. You might have buddies you`ve been playing the guitar for a while. Ask them. A player is generally capable of giving you the lowdown of where to get the best guitars for the best deals. 

Beginners are often offered package deals. These deals often give you a free strap, case, tuner, free lessons etc. This would be a wise choice for a beginner because everything you need is provided for. If you`re a parent looking to gift your kid a guitar because he seems very interested in learning, this is your best bet. 

You are a novice, and yet you want to be a good guitarist. Buying a bad guitar would not only shortchange you but it might also disillusion you. To save yourself from this, it is always wiser to buy from reputed companies such as Yamaha, Ibanez, Fender, Gibson, Ovation, Martin, and Taylor. You`ll get to choose from a variety of guitars for your skill level, at an affordable price. 

Don`t feel shy to take a good look at and play the guitar at the shop. It`s a mistake many make. After all you`re paying for it, it better be worth it. Check for soppy gluing. It`s a bad sign. Also, make sure the guitar has a solid top. Play the guitar as loudly as you want because this is the best way of hearing the tone. Play each fret on the neck to ensure there are no fret buzzes. 

This is something many don`t know. NEVER pay list price for a guitar because this is usually hugely inflated. Bargain with the sales person and ask for a reasonable discount. You will probably get it. 

Of course, buying a brand new guitar may not always be possible. In such a case you may consider a good quality second hand guitar. You could use such a guitar especially if you`re not sure if this is just a passing phase or whether you`ll stick with it. You could ask in music stores about second hand guitars. You could also look up classified ads, online ads and bulletin boards. 

If it`s just not possible for you to go down to a music store and personally select a guitar, you could always buy one online. But you must be careful. Since you`re buying the product online, you have no way of checking its finer details. Therefore, before you make any sort of payment, make sure the company has a suitable return policy. 

These are some tips on getting the best guitar for a beginner. You could keep them in mind while buying your own. Also, following is a list of the five best acoustic guitars for beginners. You could take a look at them when you go down to the music store. Of course, there`s no guarantee that you couldn`t find a better one. 

Seagull S6 / Yamaha F310 / Takamine G-240 / Fender DG-7 / Epiphone DR-100 

So go ahead, look for your ideal guitar. But search long and hard, because a good guitar, even a simple beginner`s one, could last you a lifetime. 
Lesson 3 - The secret to learn it fast: manage your time! The best guitarists of the world treat their guitar as their most important object of affection. Most call it their ""first love"". Keeping this in mind, it`s important to understand that a guitar and its player share an important ""relationship"". Just as every relationship needs to be nurtured with ample time, so does this. If you don`t give your guitar enough time, you will never develop a relationship with it. It`s important that you feel passionately about your guitar and the music you make with it. Without this passion, you can never be a good musician. 

Practice, practice, practice. There`s no better advice we can give you. It`s the only way of ever learning how to play the guitar. You need not practice for hours together, but yes, it is absolutely essential that you practice regularly; if possible, every day. There is no point in practicing for 5 hours on Sunday and then picking up your guitar next on Friday. You can devote just about 20-30 minutes at a time, but make sure it`s on a regular basis. 

But what if you are truly passionate about the guitar, but as much as you would love to, you just don`t have enough time to devote to it. Every time you look at the guitar you feel like strumming a few notes, but you just don`t know if you`ll ever be able to create good music with it. May be you really want to learn, but you can spend just a few minutes honing your skills every day. Don`t worry. We can give you a few tips which can help you improve your guitaring in spite of your inability to give it the time that it requires. 

Practice a chord change over and over again until you`ve perfected it. May be you`re having trouble switching from an F barre chord to a D open chord? You could keep practicing this every day and better yourself. As long as you keep practicing, you`re constantly making progress. 

Focus. It`s very important to. Find a skill that you can improve and work on perfecting that. You know you can`t devote much time so concentrating on one skill at a time, and you will get far. 

Everybody has a favorite song. What`s yours? Wouldn`t you love to be able to play your favorite song while you sing along? So do just that. At some point, you`re bound to get tired of playing only chords and riffs. You`re going to want to play some `music`. Choose a song you want to play and work on it. This way you`ll have fun even while you`re actually `working`. Having fun is very important when you`re learning and playing music. 

You don`t have time to take a guitar lesson, but do you think people take lessons all their life? Whatever happened to spontaneity? So what if you don`t have the time. Simply having a good ear for music is enough. Play a song and jam along with it. You can keep rewinding it until you`ve got it just right. This is what most guitarists do once they`ve got their basics right. It`s the perfect way to learn when you`re running short of time. 

Working on a lick is also a good way to learn. You can work through licks many times in just a few minutes. This is a good technique to use while practicing chord changes as well. When you have limited time, this is a good way of improving your guitar skills. 

Picking skills are very important. Working on them is also very important. Doing drills up and down the neck of the guitar can improve your picking skills tremendously, which in turn contribute to you making immense progress with your guitar. You can use your metronome to help improve your speed at picking. On the other hand, you can work on relaxing yourself while you`re playing, so that you look at ease rather than looking like you`re going through a terrible ordeal. Use a metronome to help build speed. It will give you a smooth rhythmic sound. 

Practice playing a scale. You can play a single scale about 50-100 times within a short span of ten minutes. Practicing a scale not only helps you build your stamina but also helps you increase your speed. 

Creativity is important. Play a few different chords that sound good together or even some melodies. This way you could even come up with an entire song of your own! 

Most importantly, discipline yourself and create a routine for yourself. 

These practice sessions may be small, but every little step helps. Use these tips, and add them to your own imagination, and very soon you`ll be playing the guitar like a professional. 
Lesson 4 - A Must Do Step: Learning the Fret Board Firstly, and most importantly, do you know WHAT the fret board is? Take a look at your guitar. It is the flat section on the front of the neck of the guitar. You play your chords on the fret board. There are metal bars embedded across the board, which divide it into several parts. These are called frets.   Now that you know what a fret board is, let`s discuss learning the fret board. It seems virtually impossible that one would be expected to know every single note on every single fret. But one must learn it. It is more difficult than a piano but with dedicated effort you will soon know it. Although this might seem unimportant and appear to be mere drudgery, it is very important. 

There are various methods that have been suggested for bettering one`s knowledge of the guitar fret board. 

Some suggest that you must practice away from the guitar, in your mind. Frederick Noad, in his book `Solo Guitar Playing, suggests ""mental methods"" such as ""Learning by Equivalent Notes"", ""Transfer of Position"" and ""Learning by Fret"". You must keep memorizing the notes and positions till you know them like the back of your hand. 

Position-to-note and note-to-position are also mental methods. They simply mean that whenever you think of or see a position you must know exactly which notes lie there. Similarly, whenever you see or think of a note, you must know exactly where to play it on the fret board. 

You can also design yourself some memory games or download some that are available online. These games usually consist of memory cards, which have on them either the fret numbers, or the position, or both. You must look at each card, and give the relevant information out of memory. For example, if you pick up a card which says ""Fret 3"", you will have to say ""G C F A# D G"" out aloud. You could play this with a partner on a regular basis and automatically know your guitar fret board much better than you thought you could. 

Mnemonics are used for all sorts of learning. It can help you to learn the guitar fret board as well. For example, this one - An Emu was chasing an Ape with a Drill but tripped over a Garbage can….out popped a Baby eating an Earthworm, helps you learn the open notes (and fret 12 and 24). The capitalized letters in bold are the open notes. If you are witty enough, you could come up with your own mnemonics to make your learning more fun. 

Hesitation is inevitable in all new learning, but your goal should be to minimize and eventually get rid of all hesitation. Keep pushing yourself till you don`t hesitate anymore. Take one note or one position at a time, whichever suits you, but make sure you eliminate hesitation altogether. Motivating yourself to stop hesitating every time you try to play a note is an excellent learning method. You need to practice extensively, but then ""practice makes perfect"" right? 

It`s vital that you know your `sharps` and `flats` very well. C sharp and D flat are the same note right? But when you`re playing, do you remember that. It`s essential that you do. You must know how it is played, both ways, equally well. This will show that nothing can confuse you or make you hesitate while playing the guitar, because you have a thorough knowledge of the fret board. 

The fret board has mother of pearl markers strategically placed, inlaid in the wood. Usually, these markers are laid in the exact same positions in every guitar. A standard guitar will have these markings on the third fret, the fifth and the ninth. The twelfth fret has two markers because it is exactly one octave higher than the open string. The fifteenth fret again has a single marker. These markings are not only useful but important as well because they will help you find and play the right notes on the fret board effortlessly. 

Learning the fret board is an extremely time consuming and tiring task, but once you learn it, you`re on your way to becoming a better guitarist. Motivate yourself by may be learning one fret a time. Set yourself a date by when you will know every single note on the fret board and play them naturally. You must not neglect this task, and consider it a very important part of learning how to play the guitar. 
Lesson 5 - Your Guitar is your new friend: take care of it! Taking care of your ""object of affection"" is very important. Acoustic guitars are made from the finest wood, which not only make them beautiful instruments but also produce the best sound. You need to ensure that your guitar is kept in the best condition to continue producing high quality sound. Good guitar care goes miles towards adding to the life and playability of your guitar. You may be a professional guitarist or just an amateur player, but you must take care of your guitar well and make sure it is handled well to avoid critical damage to it. This is essential for every guitarist.  
Some Guitar Care Tips Here are ten tips that will help you keep your guitar in the best condition. 

Learning how to string your guitar is very important for every guitarist. It`s an important aspect of taking care of your guitar. If you think your guitar sounds dull, and your strings show obvious signs of wear or are rusted even, it`s definitely time to restring your guitar. There is no fixed routine to follow while changing strings of guitars. Some players change strings before every performance, while others let them wear out and then change it. It depends solely on the individual. Normally, it would depend on how often you play guitar. A set of strings can last for anything between 1-3 months. 

Tuning your guitar right is important to be able to produce the perfect sound. Learn how to tune your guitar through easily available guidelines available online. You can also tune your guitar by simply using some tuning software that you can download, or buy. Guitar tuning of course is all about practice. You can buy guitar tuning forks and pitch pipes at any music store near you, and tune your guitar effortlessly. 

The fret board becomes very difficult to clean properly because the strings are stretched across it. So, when you`re stringing your guitar next, make sure you clean and take proper care of the frets as well. Don`t let sweat, grime, dirt or oil from hands build up on the frets. The best way to clean them is using a toothbrush and some soap water. A clean fret board affects the strings as well as the sound of the guitar. 

While tuning and stringing your guitar, you must also check that all screws on the guitar are tightened and strap pins properly fixed. The tuning knobs should be adequately tightened as well. 

Get your guitar a proper fitted case. Keep it in its case when it`s not being used. The case helps keep away excessive moisture, which can be damaging for the guitar. Moisture can also cause the strings to rust, and thus produce lower quality sound. 

Cleaning your guitar regularly is extremely important. You should wipe up and down the neck and the body of the guitar. A clean guitar not only looks as good, but also sounds better. 

You must ensure that you protect your guitar from extremes in temperature. Excessive heat can cause shrinkage, cracking, swelling and warping of the guitar. Extreme cold can also be harmful because the cold can destroy the binding of the guitar. 

Never apply pressure to the soundboard or the bridging area. Flexing the soundboard can crack it. You must therefore always keep in mind that when you pass your guitar to someone, hold it by the neck and not the soundboard. 

Be very careful when you`re transporting your guitar. The slightest manhandling can cause it great damage. Always carry the guitar in its case. Further, place it in an airtight case so that a small amount of moisture is locked within. This protects the guitar from the variations of temperature while traveling from one place to the other. The moisture that is sealed in can protect a guitar from excessively dry climates. 

Last, but not the least, the best way to take care of your guitar, is by playing it. There is no better advice. A guitar that is seldom played lies neglected and is not well taken care of. Play your guitar regularly. Only when you play it, will you realize when it needs tuning, or whether it needs new strings or any other glitches that might go unnoticed when you hardly ever play your guitar. 

Use these tips well. Taking care of an instrument is a very important part of learning how to play it. You must be passionate not only about music, but about your guitar as well. You must take care of it because at the end of the day, it is your music that will get affected if you use an ill taken care of guitar. 
Necessary equipment: Guitar is the most important equipment required to pursue this hobby. As a beginner, make sure that you don’t buy the first guitar you come across in a store or on the Internet because not all are suitable to learn with. There are few things you must consider when buying a good guitar. The fret board and strings must be close so that it is easy to press. If the strings are placed high, it can be very difficult for a beginner to learn. The best way of checking whether the string height is proper or not is to stack two quarters and place it under the first string which is the thinnest at 12th fret (2 dots). The distance ideally must be the equivalent spacing of 1½ quarters. If the quarters fit without having to lift the string, it means the maximum height is acceptable. When you buy a guitar, get it tuned. If the tuning gear is exposed it means the guitar has cheap tuners. Good quality tuners are encased and are die-cast. There are two immediate choices in guitars: electric or acoustic. Even though both look different, the position for picking, strumming and chording is similar. If you are able to play an acoustic guitar, you will be able to play the electric version too. There is no need to start learning on acoustic guitars. Begin with any type because practice is required for both. If an 8 or 12-year-old wants to learn guitar as a hobby, buy a small size - three quarter size acoustic guitar.   

The second most important equipment is a tuner. It is essential to keep your guitar in tune and with the help of a guitar tuner, a small device operated with battery, you can tune in an easy and quick manner. If you are buying an electric guitar, you can add more flexibility with different distortions and amps. You should research in order to find good deals on headphones and amps on the Internet. 
Best place for buying a guitar: The best bet for getting a good guitar is to purchase from a music store because the staff can help you select good beginner’s guitar of your choice. In case you visit any pawnshop or second hand instrument store, ask a guitar-playing friend of yours to accompany you for good advice. He or she can check the guitar and let you know whether it is a good buy or not. Usually, a beginner’s guitar of good quality is available in 175 to 375 dollars. Don’t forget to purchase a strap, case and tuner for a better learning experience. 
How to get started? As a beginner all you require is a little patience and lots of practice. Find a nice and quiet place inside or outside your house where you can spend time practicing without getting disturbed. Always remember to start slow and then work your way up because first you need to learn the basics. Once you have a good quality guitar you need to start learning how to read tabs and songs. Tablature and tabs are musical sheets with the help of which you get to know the point where you are supposed to place your finger and play the notes. It is not difficult to learn reading tabs. You can find guitar tabs on the Internet free of cost for any song you wish to learn. Internet is full of reference materials that can help you learn the guitar easily. You can either get access to some books based on guitars or buy videos for a live demo of guitar playing techniques. You can even join online classes for a better understanding of guitars. Make sure that you practice what you have learnt on a regular basis. Manage your time and take care of the instrument so that it doesn’t get lost or damaged.   Keep strumming!",
Hunting,"Section 1: Types of Hunting          Hunting is as much an art as it is a sport or a hobby. There are literally dozens of methods of hunting and just as many weapons available to those who embark on the adventure. Hunting techniques vary according to the game, its habitat, and in some cases even the regulations of the area of your hunt. They are governed by strict rules on the equipment used and the behavior to adopt.Methods of hunting land critters are typically broken down into categories: Still Hunting and Stand Hunting.Still Hunting                    Still Hunting (Otherwise known to the outdoor-oriented as “Spot & Stalk”) is a common method of hunting used to hunt North American big game species such as deer, elk, bear, and feral hogs. “Still Hunting” (Not calling it Spot & Stalk is a bit foreign) is the process of hunting an animal by sneaking into habitats where the animal lives, breeds, or engages in otherwise typical critter activity and trying to spot the animal before the animal spots you. This is done by tracking animals down by looking for their tracks, droppings, mating signs, etc., following these signs very carefully, locating an animal and then planning your stalk on said animal.  This is a very popular method to obtain meat, however does take skill and practice as well as a high-tolerance for frustration. When following the animal signs, it is important to walk very slowly and very quietly while constantly scanning for movement and wildlife and even taking several hour breaks to perch in a favorable position to scan the terrain with your ‘Knockers (Binoculars for the casual hunter) in a method referred to as “Glassing”. It is also important to stop frequently to watch and listen for wildlife around you as well as being aware of wind direction, because if the wind is blowing in the direction that you are walking, it is likely that the animal that you are hunting will smell you (use the term “Catch Wind of you” if you want to seem seasoned) and scurry or “spook” before you ever come into contact with the animal. Here are a few quick tips for a (Hopefully) successful Spot & Stalk (or “Still Hunt” if you’re still using that lingo) and really, to some extend, all hunting in general:1. Elevation. Find an elevated vantage point, such as trees, rocks or hilly terrain. Check the area thoroughly (Typically 45min at LEAST). If you see nothing, move to another vantage point and check the next area.2. Fresh Tracks. Look for fresh tracks and sign, moving slowly, walking a few steps at a time, and stopping often to scan and study the surroundings. Always be ready to shoot, if it feels right. You never know when a critter could present itself to be the next addition to your freezer.3. Wind Direction. Know your wind direction to avoid an animal catching your scent as you approach. Stay downwind of the animal (the wind is in your face) to avoid being detected. You can buy fancy gear to help with this, but some dusty dirt thrown into the air does the trick.3. Walk quietly through the terrain. Avoid stepping on sticks and other debris that could make noise and alert animals to your presence and spook them. Wet or damp conditions create better stalking conditions because the terrain becomes quieter when leaves, pine cones and other woodland debris are wet, soggy and less brittle. Nothing is worse than getting into shooting distance and leaning on a twig.5. Clothing. Dress comfortably in soft, quiet, scent-free clothing so you can move freely with ease and stealth. (Will cover this more in the next section labeled “Gear”)6. Tune into your senses. Listen to all the sounds around you, as they might reveal an animals’ location. Animal sounds can indicate other critters are aware of you, such as squirrels chattering, crows cawing, elk barking or deer snorting.7. Vision. Look around to detect shapes, colors and movements that identify prey. Peripheral vision — seeing what is off to your sides when looking ahead — also helps quite a bit. Glassing is the best thing a hunter can get good at besides placing a good shot. A good hunter will spend 70% of his Still Hunt watching and looking. When you get really good, you’ll be able to notice a ear-flick of a mule deer in a spruce thicket or be able to see a whitetail’s back-end on a snowy ridgeline.8. Dress lightly and strategically.Do not dress too heavily or you’ll make some noise and larger movements. You’ll also sweat, which could make it easier for animals to smell the human stink. Quality boots are a must and a hat with a bill helps shield your face from the sun’s glare.9. Stay calm and collected.Let this speak for itself. If your breathing quickens and your heart starts racing, stop and regain your composure before resuming the stalk. As exciting as it is, I promise you; it’s loads more exciting when you walk up on a fresh kill. Stand Hunting                   Stand hunting is likely the most common form of hunting used today when hunting for most North American big game species. Stand hunting is when the hunter is stationary in one location and waits for the animal to come to them. Hunters often use tree-stands, ground blinds, and tripod stands to make the hunt more comfortable and to make it harder for the wildlife to spot them. The locations where hunters chose to stand hunt varies greatly. Often hunters will set up a stand near a food source that their target animal species is coming to for food (Be careful of this, read your area’s hunting Regulations to be sure baiting is allowed). Hunters will also stand hunt along game trails, and even near water sources in drier climates. The stand hunting method is also the fundamental method used when using baiting techniques or for a first time hunter that may not find it appealing to walk many miles in a Spot & Stalk or doesn’t have all the gear. Here are a few quick techniques to improve your chances with Stand Hunting:1. Pre-Season ScoutingKnowing where to set up your blind is likely the biggest factor in scoring on the creature you’re hunting for. For example, a mature deer simply doesn’t travel in the open, and the game trails snaking through dense cover are always a better option for locating trophy antlers or that big meat buck you’re looking for.2. Set Up Well in AdvanceSetting up a blind or a tree stand before you plan to hunt from it can help maximize its effectiveness. Deer, elk, and other animals will avoid new objects in their area until they are proven to be mundane. Setting up your Stand a couple of weeks before the hunting season allows the new smells and outlines to become part of the familiar territory that your desired critter inhabits.3. Camouflage ItThis is important. Don’t just settle for a blind set up on a fence line or ridge top or in a strip of trees. Blend it into the environment with brush, grass, cattails or whatever natural vegetation is handy. Most quality blinds have straps or cords to attach natural camouflage and help your blind disappear. Fresh-cut tree limbs and bunches of grass or straw also help veil the smell of your blind. Some blinds come with carbon odor suppressors, but there are still smells from manufacturing, packaging and travel that take time to dissipate. The best way to make it scent free is to leave it set up outdoors in the elements. Over time it becomes part of the habitat in both sight and smell.4. Play the Wind and SunNo matter how hard you try to cover or hide human scent, a critter can still detect it. Seasoned hunters know to stage upwind of their quarry whenever possible to circumvent an animals’ incredible nose. When you locate an active game trail being used by a big buck (for example), try to find a spot to set up your blind downwind with the sun behind you. If the early-morning sun is shining on your face, you will glow like a light bulb when looking out of the windows. This might mean setting up different blinds for hunting the morning and evening, depending on prevailing winds and sunrise or sunset locations. Dress in dark clothing to take advantage of the dark cave you are creating. Wear a facemask or put on some camo makeup to gain yet another advantage.Calls                    Calls  are another commonly used method of hunting, and maybe one of the most important tools while out there. The technique of calling can be a very effective. Calling is the process of using game calls or some other instrument to replicate the sounds of the animal that you are hunting. Game calls are especially effective during the desired species' mating season, when the males are hot & heavy and keeping an ear out for a female or another male stepping to their territory. During this time, animal mating calls can be a sure fire way to lure in an animal that is within earshot of you.The most common calls used when hunting deer are grunt calls, bleat calls, and rattling antlers. The grunt call can be aggressive buck grunts that would attract a buck that is looking to display his dominance, while bleat calls mimic the sound of a doe that is looking for a buck to breed her. Rattling antlers imitate the sound of two bucks fighting and can lure other bucks in to see what the commotion is all about. All game have different sounding calls and different methods of calling.Here are a few quick-hit Hunting Methods, some covered here already and some short enough to self-explain:Baiting is the use of decoys, lures, scent or food to attract targeted animals.Camouflage is concealing oneself visually, or with scent, to blend in with the environment.Dogs may be used to help flush, herd, drive, track, point at, pursue, or retrieve animals.Game drive system was a prehistoric hunting strategy where game were herded into areas where they could be hunted in groups.Driving is the herding of animals in a particular direction, as over a cliff or to other hunters.Flushing is the practice of scaring targets from concealed areas.Spotlighting is the use of artificial light to find or blind targets before capture. Modern lighting also includes IR and other devices.Tracking is the practice of interpreting physical evidence to pursue animals.Trapping is the use of devices (e.g., snares, pits, deadfalls) to capture or kill an animal.",

Pinball Machines,"Pinball Machines Information  Introduction One of the most unforgettable experience as a child is placing a quarter into a Pinball machine and trying to beat the last persons’ high score. The most amazing aspect to playing Pinball is that the machines are typically simplistic in their design. Essentially, pinball is little more than preventing the silver ball from dropping out of play and getting a game over after three attempts. For the most part, this is the type of play that most people get out of pinball games. Sure the lights and buzzers make the games truly addicting and quite fun, but there is another way that people play the machines. The name of the game for a large majority of players is points. For these players, the ball dropping out of play is the least of their concerns. These people weigh their skill against the risks of shooting the ball in such a way that they score more points. 

Over the course of the last one hundred years, the development of pinball machines has come a long way. Starting from the most basic machines that consisted of little more than preventing the ball from dropping to the complex sophisticated machines of the 21st century, there are literally games for every single type of person regardless of age or sex. There are games based of books, video games, movies and almost any genre you could ever imagine. Although they are enjoyable for all ages, there have also been cases of illegal gambling with machines that have caused bans in areas of North America, but compared to the positives associated with the machines, pinball games could be considered a hobby for the whole family. 
Tips and Tricks The primary skill of pinball involves applying the proper timing and technique to the operation of the flippers, gently nudging the playfield when appropriate without causing the machine to tilt, and choosing targets for high scores or features that build up high scoring opportunities. A skilled player can quickly ""learn the angles"" and gain a high level of control of ball motion, even on a table they`ve never played, but just because you can’t do it your first time out doesn’t mean the next time won’t be different. 

The first step to playing a new game should be by reading the game’s rules that are found on a placard that is usually in a lower corner of the playfield. Most times, it may simply show pricing information, but sometimes it also shows critical details about special scoring techniques. Such information is vital to achieving higher scores, and it typically describes a series of events that must take place (e.g., shoot right ramp and left drop targets to light `extra ball` rollover). Learning these details makes the game more fun and challenging. With practice, and a table in good operating condition, a player can often achieve specific targets and higher scores as well as triggering exciting events. 

One of the simplest tricks a beginner should learn is the art of nudging the table. Skillful players can influence the movement of the ball by nudging or bumping the pinball machine, but there are tilt mechanisms which guard against excessive manipulation of this sort. The hazard of using this method to further manipulate the pinball game is that if the tilt function is enabled, the game controls will freeze, and all you can do is stand helpless as your ball drops from the playfield. The mechanisms generally include sensors and plum bobs that are able to sense outside manipulation of the machine. A tilt will usually also result in the loss of any bonus points earned by the player during that ball. Where some modern games give tilt warnings before sacrificing the ball in play, older games would immediately end the ball in play on a tilt. 

Another almost must in a true Pinball gamers repertoire of moves is his or her ability to trap the ball. This method is used by skilled players that can hold a ball in place with the flipper, giving them more control over where they want to place the ball when they shoot it forward. This technique involves catching the ball in the corner between the base of the flipper and the wall to its side, just as the ball falls towards the flipper. The flipper is then released, which allows the ball to roll slowly downward towards the flipper. The player then chooses at what moment to hit the flipper again, timing the shot as the ball slides slowly towards the end of the flipper. Once a player has successfully trapped a ball, they may then attempt to ""juggle"" the ball to the other flipper. This is done by tapping the flipper button quickly enough so that the trapped ball is knocked back at an angle of less than 90 degrees into the bottom of the nearest slingshot. The ball will then often bounce across the table to the other flipper, where the ball may then be hit or again trapped by the opposite flipper. The true goal behind this technique is to aim the ball at specific areas of the play field to maximize your potential score. 
Pinball in Popular Culture Pinball games have frequently been featured in popular culture since there has been pinball machines, often as a symbol of rebellion or toughness. The most famous instance in the history of pinball games is the rock opera album Tommy (1969) by The Who, which centers on the title character, a ""deaf, dumb, and blind kid"", who nevertheless becomes a ""Pinball Wizard"" who uses pinball as a symbol and tool for his messianic mission. Wizard has since become synonymous as a term for an expert pinball player. Things came full circle when Bally created the Tommy Pinball Wizard pinball game featuring Ann-Margret and The Who`s Roger Daltrey on the backglass. In the movie version, Tommy plays a Gottlieb Kings and Queens machine, while The Champ plays a Gottlieb Buckaroo machine. 

Other recognized moments in popular culture include the following list of instances where Pinball played some sort of aspect in television or movies. A much harder task is to try to find programs that have not mentioned pinball in one way or another than finding programs or movies that do. 

- Sesame Street had a segment called Pinball Number Count where a pinball goes through many different places. The song was sung by The Pointer Sisters. 

- Monday Night Football introduction played a computer generated pinball with their theme song. 

- There are many references to pinball on The Simpsons. Sideshow Bob said that his former medium of TV ""destroyed more young minds than syphilis and pinball combined.""   - Blernsball, the futuristic version of baseball in Futurama, features pinball game elements, including captive balls and multiball.   - Pinball-themed zones made numerous appearances in the Sonic the Hedgehog series of video games, including an entire game based on the Pinball theme, Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball. Sonic Adventure`s Casinopolis had two room that played like Pinball games. 

- A Pinball-themed courtship is featured in Bad Santa when Billy Bob Thornton shows the mechanics of the ""tilt mechanism."" 

- In the Disney movie The Game Plan, Peyton plays a pinball machine when she goes into Joe`s house while Joe reads Peyton`s birth certificate or letter. 

- In an episode of South Park, Indiana Jones is seen playing a Howard the Duck pinball machine. However, such a pinball has never been built. 
Conclusion Pinball, simply put, is one of the most fun hobbies in the world that you can become a part of at anytime. Despite your age, sex, body build, ect., you can play pinball, and you can be good at it with a little practice. There is a big difference between playing a pinball machine, and playing in a pinball machine hall where all around you are the flashing lights and sounds of pinball machines. The hardest part for most people new to the hobby is choosing whether you will be playing a vintage machine from the 60’s or a brand new game from the past few years. All games are rewarding in one way or another, and every single pinball machine will challenge all of your skills. But maybe playing the machines are just one part of your love affair with these beautiful machines. Maybe the true challenge behind these machines is restoring old broken machines for new people to play on in the future. With pinball games, the future truly is open, and with new technological advances every year, it is impossible to tell what the future hold for pinball machines.",
Inline Skating,"Inline Skating Information  Introduction Inline skating isn’t a new hobby by any stretch of the imagination, but it is one of the easiest hobbies to get involved in. Essentially, the only thing required to join the hobby is to basically buy a pair of your own inline skates, which are more widely known as roller blades, and start skating. Because of its short learning curve, it is one of the fastest activity to learn, and in addition to its learning curve, inline skating leads to a healthy lifestyle by building muscular and cardiovascular health. Not only is it a hobby that is easy to learn and leads to a healthy lifestyle, it is also a whole lot of fun. 

Since the invention of roller skates, the parents of inline skating, in the 1700’s, roller skating has been a huge part of peoples’ lives for over three hundred years. One of the best parts of inline skating is that it is possible to practice and have fun year round at nearly any outdoor or indoor area. All you have to do is basically put the roller blades on and skate away. But what kind of skating are you going to do? That’s right, there is no longer the idea of simply skating in a straight line in modern times. Although it is recommended for beginners to keep it simple, more advanced skates implement jumps, twists, grinds, and high speeds into their skating repertoire. But to understand the newest forms of skating, it is important to review the evolution from roller skates to inline skates, and how the two intersect in many ways. 
History of Inline Skating / Roller Blading The origins of roller skating begins in the mid 1700’s where the first recorded use of roller skates, in a London stage performance took place, but the inventor of this most unusual invention is sadly lost to history. It is actually the year 1760 that the first recorded skate invention is recorded by inventor John Joseph Merlin, who demonstrated the workings of a primitive inline skate with metal wheels. But it wasn’t until another fifty-nine years passes that the first patented roller skate design, by M. Petitbled, was showcased in France in the year 1819. Although remarkable for the times, the skates were able to do little more than move in a straight line and make wide turns. For the remainder of the 19th century, inventors worked continuously on improving the skate design, but it wasn’t until 1863 that major changes were made. 
Inline Skating Federations The first thing we have to understand prior to looking at inline skating federations is that there is no actual requirement for anyone to join these organizations should the only goal of the hobby is to have fun. If you are looking to become more involved in the sport, it would be a good idea to look into the federation of your own country as they can lead you in the right direction should you wish to enter competitions. The true goal of all skating federations is to essentially promote the sport of roller and inline skating. 

Although there are numerous skating organizations throughout the world, one of the largest and most influential is in the United States where the controlling organization is USA Roller Sports, headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska, also home of the National Museum of Roller Skating. Nationals are held each summer with skaters required to qualify through regional competitions. Other groups include the International Freestyle Skating Association, Federation Internationale de Roller-Skating (the international organization for competitive roller sports), British Federation of Roller Skating, Canadian Skating Association, International Inline Stunt Federation, and Skate Australia. 
Purchasing Inline Skates If you have decided to give inline skating a shot, and you have never tried it before, it may be a good idea to not make a substantial investment in equipment should you decide you actually don’t like the hobby. This goes the same for children who are new to the sport, or even if you have any other doubts about the longevity of your interest in the sport. Should this be the case, there are temporary skate solutions that can get you rollerblading without dropping a large amount of money should you decide that it isn’t right for you. 

The main option for beginners is to either purchase inexpensive used equipment, or to rent equipment until more confidence is gained. There is nothing worse that purchasing $250 worth of equipment for a child and finding out after two weeks that they absolutely hate the sport. Other than saving money, it is important to learn the difference between inexpensive and expensive equipment. Used inline skates typically don’t roll as fast or smoothly as more expensive models, but it does allow beginners to learn how to skate without gaining major speeds. More expensive equipment is designed to make skating as easy as possible for the hobbyist by allowing smooth, gliding wheels, and generally better design that holds up to more wear and tear. By working oneself through different types of equipment, the skater’s learning curve is less steep, and helps to master the skills required for more advanced riding. 
Safety Gear is a Must One of the most important parts of roller and inline skating has to be the protective gear worn by the skater at all times. Where protective equipment is usually optional for practitioners, protective gear for inline skating is a must. Not only is it essential for beginners, it is also crucial for all levels of experience when it comes to inline skating. This is one sport where there is an abundance of protective gear, due to the face that it is the same gear worn by bikers and skate boarders, yet there are numerous injuries and fatalities every year because safety equipment is not worn. The fact is that you can be as careful as you can be, but accidents can happen and they are never expected. With the number of injuries growing each year, more and more cities and municipalities have begun to enforce laws enforcing the use of safety gear. 

It is important to purchase all safety gear new to ensure that it has not been compromised by previous usage. Never be afraid to inspect the equipment before you buy it as any cracks or wreaked straps will compromise the safety of the equipment. \\the most important equipment by far is the helmet, which will protect you head should you fall while skating. Other equipment that is often worn are elbow pads, knee pads, and wrist guards, which are often sold as sets for your convenience. All of these will protect you if you should fall, and since skating is a lot like riding a bike for the first time, you are bound to fall a couple times before mastering inline skating. Other equipment that is not essential are padded shorts to protect your tailbone, hips and thighs, ankle and shin guards are worn to prevent bruises on your lower legs, and body armor is recommending for advance skating where new tricks are being learned. 
Popular Culture and Inline Skating Although inline skating has been popular in today’s culture, it hasn’t had a large impact in films and television until the release of the film Whip It in 2009. The film is directed by Drew Berrymore and stars herself alongside Ellen Page and centers around a small town girl who joins a hardcore all girl roller derby team. Unfortunately, inline skating has been seen in other films yet hadn’t been featured until Drew Berrymore’s film of 2009. Other films that has rollerblading were the Disney Channel Original Movie Brinkl, which shows inline skating as an extreme sport competition for teens in California, Roll Bounce, which centers around a group of teens that compete in competitions in the late 1970’s,and ATL, where the characters had a great love for skating. 

Due to the close relationship between inline skates and hockey skates, it is more common to see full hockey games now played on inline skates rather than just normal ice skates. With new leagues popping up all over the world, new and experienced players are given the chance to play hockey even when there is no ice around to play on. But just like traditional ice hockey, it is essential to always wear protective gear while wearing inline skates because the fast nature of hockey creates a faster pace for players to travel at, which raises the risk of injury. 

A more important inclusion of inline skating in popular culture is the sport’s inclusion in the famous extreme x-game competitions that used to feature skateboarding and bmx biking. These games feature professional athletes competing in advanced competitions like half pipes, skate parks, and big air. These games do not feature simple riding, but rather the extreme that the sport has to offer. This includes front and back flips, spins and twists, grinds and grabs, and much, much more. It has been these events that have inspired new riders over the course of the past twenty plus years to join the sport, but has also gone a long way to enforce proper safety gear for all levels of riders. 
Conclusion As one of the easiest hobbies to become a part of, inline skating is available for all levels of experience and is really a lot of fun. Not only is it an enjoyable hobby, it also provide a great source of daily physical fitness that many people are missing in their day to day routines. The sport creates a stronger, healthier body by working key muscle groups, while at the same time increasing the size of your cardiovascular. In this way, rollerblading has a positive influence on all other daily activities because you will simply be more healthy after riding for only a short period. 

For those who don’t find the same thrills as many across North America in simply skating through city streets and parks, there are more advanced areas of inline skating that you will probably want to try. For more advanced options like artistic, dance, or extreme rollerblading, it is helpful to checkout local organizations that can match you up with others of the same interest. If ride alone is fun, just imaging how much fun it is to ride in big groups of other enthusiasts. But in the end, there is only one very important rule you must always follow when inline skating or roller skating, and that is to always, always, always wear the appropriate safety equipment because you never know when an accident will take place. Other than that, get out there and have fun!",
Acroyoga,"Acroyoga Information  Introduction Acroyoga, acrobalance, and adagio are all slightly different ways to incorporate acrobatics into more strength and control type of moves and movements. Typically in these three types of specialized acrobatics there are two or more people involved in creating the various positions and poses, although in each there are also individual elements. To be good at acrobalance, adagio and acroyoga one has to develop strong core muscles, which are the large body muscles of the thighs, buttocks, torso, generally considered the muscles associated with balance and control. 

People of all ages, sizes and strength levels can participate in various types of acrobalance, acroyoga and adagio. There is no requirement for a lot of special equipment making this a good choice for those interested in training but not necessarily interested in weight training or high levels of cardio training. Combining any of these activities with cardio and some light weight training can have amazing health and weight loss results, which is always something to consider. 

As a hobby these art forms allow individuals to learn some basic poses or movements, then move to more complex and multi-person poses when their comfort level increases. Although relatively new as a competitive form there are events held throughout the country both at local, state and national levels of competitions if you really want to get involved in the sport. Many individuals that love the style of gymnastics but don`t want the really high physical fitness requirements find adagio, acrobalance and acroyoga a wonderful alternative that is much less competitive and more cooperative in nature. 
Lessons and Practice There are many schools that specialize in Acroyoga. However, if you don`t want to go through a full training you can also take a class or work on your own with a small group to develop the skills. There are also a variety of videos online explaining how to train for a variety of positions used through all three types of activities. 

Yoga classes, Tia Chi or similar types of martial arts exercise classes can be very helpful in both learning different ways to control the body as well as basic positions that are considered to be effective in training the muscle groups. In yoga classes these positions are known as the asana. Generally people think of the lotus position when they think of yoga, but this is not the only position. The lotus position involves sitting with the knees bent and crossed, arms resting on the insides of the knees with the back straight and the head up. 

Other yoga asana positions that are beneficial for acrobalance, adagio and acroyoga include the sarvangasana, which involves the practitioner keeping the neck, head and shoulders on the mat but the body from the back of the shoulders to the tips of the toes is perpendicular to the floor. The elbows are bent and used to support the lower back and keep the body straight. Other positions include a high lunge, similar to a runners stretch, as well as a bridge type position that produces a deep stretch through the entire core. 

Other common positions you can learn at a yoga class or in an exercise class include the upward bow, which is like the bridge position only bent backward and the headstand, great for reducing tension but also for strengthening the length of the body. 

There are several one person positions in acrobalance that can be learned and perfected even if you don`t yet have a partner or small group. The planche, which is basically a handstand with the body in a parallel to the ground position is a key element that works to strengthen the arms and core muscles. The horse stance, basically a pose like a jockey on a horse with bent knees and slightly forward upper body is essential in almost all partner moves but can be practiced on your own. 

The L-base position, which is also known as the Risley position, is key for most partner moves. It involves the individual relaxing on their back with the legs straight up in the air from the hips. While an easy position to get into it does require considerable abdominal strength and core muscles to sustain the position without wobbling or trembling. This is a key skill for those that will be the base position for a variety of poses. Concentration as well as leg and back strength are essential to develop when others are balancing on your legs above you with no contact with the ground. 

Once you go beyond working on individual positions it is absolutely essential to have a spotter in any type of lift or position. This is because neither the base or the flyer can adjust their position fast enough to provide protection for each other in the event of a wobble, slip or a lost grip between the partners. The spotter needs to know the positions as well as be strong enough to bear the weight of the flyer to assist the base if some slip or unexpected movement occurs. For multiple flyers and individuals having at least one spotter per flyer will be important until the technique for getting into and maintaining the position is fully understood and mastered by everyone on the squad. Safety does need to be a concern although with the right number of spotters and a bit of padding there are rarely any injuries you wouldn`t expect in any other type of athletic event or practice. 

Working with a partner is the next step and requires you both to understand what positions you are working on and how to safely manage to obtain those positions. Most people that practice adagio, acrobalance and acroyoga recommend starting with very simple positions and learning how to balance using each other`s bodies as well as how to respond to movements by the other individual. Almost all the individual movements will be incorporated into the tandem styles and poses. 

For example, from the L-base position another person, the flyer, can assume a variety of poses to great different complex positions. Front flying, also known as the Airplane or bird, starts with the base in the L position, flyer standing facing the base with their feet about two feet from the base`s buttock. The flyer gradually leans forward and the base positions the flat of their feet on the flyer`s hips. The weight is transferred from the flyer`s feet to the base`s feet and the flyer is raised in the air. They have to hold their body completely stiff, like a plank, to obtain the appearance of flying. The hands do not make contact until there is a transition into another position. 

A very complex two person position is the tandem planche. One person, the base, assumes the planche position then a second person assumes the planche position using the base`s body, not actually touching the ground. The contact point between the two individuals is the base`s back, which results in the appearance of a teeter totter that is perfectly level. Not only does this require incredible strength and balance but it also requires intense concentration by both individuals. 

Many of the cheerleader types of positions such as pyramids, chair stands, angle and star positions are actually acrobalance, adagio and acroyoga. The angle is similar to the front flyer position for the flyer, but the base is standing, holding the flyer above their heads with straight arms. The star is also a similar balance however the base is using only one arm fully extended above the head to hold the flyer on the lower hip. The flyers lower arm is on the base`s shoulder and the two legs and the top arm fully extended to create the star like shape. 

Three, four and multiple person positions are also possible in all disciplines. Working with a larger group in more complex positions requires a lot of practice and strength but it is a great workout as well as a team building activity. 
Equipment Generally the equipment required for acrobalance, acroyoga and adagio is very minimal and very low cost. Tumbling mats or yoga mats are a good idea, especially for two party or multiple party types of lifts and work. These mats can be spread over any type of floor surface to provide a bit of padding and comfort, particularly for the base. They will also be helpful in preventing any injuries if there is a misstep or a slip during any of the positions. For multiple flyer and base poses and positions heavier tumbling mats may be important until the group is used to working together and has learned how to mount and control all the lifts and positions within the specific pose. 

Clothing can be anything that is comfortable and not too loose to cause problems with catching or pulling. Sweats, shorts, leggings or running gear is great for both men and women. Many people wear general street clothing including jeans and shorts to complete this type of activity. In competitions more gymnastic style clothing is typically worn, however even this depends on the individual group and the theme of the performance. Generally most people, at least for practice, don`t wear shoes and socks to provide additional grip and control. With any type of step up positions onto the base such as the candlestick or chair types of positions or any lifts, shoes are likely to cause a lot of discomfort for the base. Gymnastics shoes or acrobatic shoes with slip proof soles are often used in competitions as they closely mimic the experience of having bare feet. Hard soled running shoes or other types of shoes are almost never worn because they can cause injuries and a lack of ability to feel subtle muscle movements by the others in the pose. 

Video equipment such as a TV, VCR or DVD player and camcorder can be very helpful both in showing training videos as well as viewing your own technique and poses. This will be particularly true if you are interested in competition at any level. Having someone to work with you as a coach or a trainer is more essential at advanced levels but can also be a good idea when you are getting started as well. 

Training and practice can occur in any suitable type of room. If you are doing lifts from a standing position the ceiling will need to be higher than the standard in a home but a garage or gymnastics room is an excellent option. In the summer and in nice weather training can even happen outside, with the soft ground a perfect floor for any type of training or position. 
Conclusion Although not a common hobby or sport, the disciplines of acrobalance, acroyoga and adagio offer a lot of health benefits to anyone interested in getting started. Not only will you develop a greater awareness of your body and body positioning but you will also have much stronger core, better muscle control and a greater sense of self-confidence in everything that you do. 

Unlike yoga which can be a singular experience, acrobalance and acroyoga along with the more physically involved adagio provide a wonderful opportunity to work with another person or a small group. This sense of teamwork and building on each other`s skills is one of the many benefits of these unique types of hobbies and exercise forms.",
Video Games,"Video Games Information  Introduction It is nearly impossible to live in today’s modern age and not have some influence in your life from video games. They are in the news, they are on billboards, they influence various Hollywood movies, and they are basically all around us. Video games are made to entertain, to educate, and to now live active lifestyles, but over the course of only sixty years, the video game industry has changed drastically. New electronic breakthroughs are made every year, new games are created every six months, and online gaming changes daily. For years, it was thought to be a solely male hobby to take part in, but with the newest motion sensor technology by Nintendo with their Wii system, more and more women are becoming gamers every year. To imagine the world without video games would be completely absurd at this point in time as some games tend to now make more money than world released movies and sporting events. It is because of the popularity of video games that gaming is one of the most accessible hobbies for both men and women to take part in individually, with friends, or with friends around the world online. To initially choose a gaming system to begin gaming with, one has to simply weigh the pros and cons of each system to choose accordingly. But before we choose what type of gaming counsel or games we would like to play, we must look at the fast moving pace of video game history to fully understand the hobby that is video games. 


How to Choose a Consoles
 Although the history of video games appears to be quite daunting with its fast pace that spans half of the twentieth, there really are only four gaming consoles available to the new to average gamer. These four are basically the Xbox 306, Playstation 3, the Nintendo Wii, and the Home PC. Although all four can all play basically the same games, they all have pros and cons that should be looked at prior to purchasing the systems.
 



The Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 are essentially the same system except for some minor difference. The most important difference is the Playstation 3 comes with a built in BlueRay player where the Xbox 360 comes with an optional HDDVD, which movies are no longer being made for. Perhaps a down out win by the Playstation 3, but most gamers have appeared to care little about the BlueRay player, and instead seem to focus on the lower price of the Xbox 360. With both system boasting similar graphics and video, the other thing one has to consider is that due to their direct competition, there are some games that are exclusive to one system or another. For example, God of War 3 is exclusive for Playstation 3 where Allan Wake is exclusively for X Box 360.
 



The Nintendo Wii has proven itself to be the wave of the future by developing motion sensor gaming that is exclusive right now only for the Nintendo Wii. Gamers are no longer able to sit and vegetate while playing games because to play Nintendo Wii games requires the player to go through the movements they are watching on the screen. From this stand point, the newest Nintendo games demands the users fullest involvement and attention to do well in video games. It is for this reason alone that Nintendo has set the Wii apart from all other competitors as the amount of games and the actual graphics of the available games are significantly lower than those of the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. The Wii does however offer the only true work out games available that offers computerized trainers leading you through various workouts on a day to day basis. It is for this level of interactivity that is drawing new gamers into the video gaming realm along with being the least expensive of the four major consoles.
 



The last source of video games is the Home PC, which is gradually being replaced by the other three video game consoles. At one time, it was generally considered to be the only true source of video games, but in today’s age a majority of gamers are moving towards counsel gaming. The pro to all computer games is that you are given control over updating your computer hardware so that it is capable to running certain games, and since computers can run at faster speeds that consoles that are limited to their design, PC games tend to run faster and smoother. The issue with this is that you have to spend money in order to play games that are designed to need specific hardware to run. Without that specific hardware, your game will simply not run. Counsel games on the other hand are made with the system requirements set in stone so that you never have to update the hardware on your gaming consoles. 


Vintage Consoles Return
 A strange thing happened during the seventh generation of video game consoles. All those kids that grew up with the second and third generation consoles, more specifically the Nintendo and Super Nintendo consoles, actually grew up. Perhaps it was for nostalgia reasons, but those older consoles that had been long since discontinued began to grow in popularity yet again. The problem facing most gamers seeking the now vintage games of their childhood was that they had long since sold their old systems when upgrading to the newest generation. Suddenly second hand stores and pawn shops are begging to make a regular profit off of vintage gaming consoles along with their games.
 



Along with the sales of the vintage consoles of the second and third generations of counsel games, an entirely new market has arisen to serve the needs of those purchasing vintage consoles. The problem that most people have once they obtain these vintage machines is that they are on average 20 – 25 years old. After such a long time, pieces and parts are bounds to get dirty, broken, or lost and need to be replaced. There is now an entire market surrounding the need to fix and repair the older gaming machines. There are now manufacturing companies that are begging to make replicas of vintage machines like controllers, cables, ect.. It is now actually possible to purchase a vintage counsel and revamp it so that it is literally better than when it was new.
 



Even if you are not interested in the actual playing of video games, the hobby or restoring vintage machines can be a very rewarding experience. Not only are people more than willing to spend money on retro gaming systems from their childhood, but they are also more than happy to purchase something that actually works. More often than not, a simple cleaning is all that is required, but sometimes electrical parts or circuit boards require replacing, and by taking the system from the preverbal graveyard to playing everyone’s beloved Super Mario video game, could turn into a lifelong passion and fulltime business. 


There are still companies like Activision & Rockstar that are still creating some classic games for PC, such as the Grand Theft Auto series. PC gaming is still one of the most popular ways to escape from everyday life stress, and with connectivity being available worldwide it has now become virtually impossible to not get online. This has seen dramatic growth for the online casino gaming industry - with classic games like roulette, poker and blackjack being available 24/7. People are very keen to get involved to win some big money and if it`s not for that, people are using it to even host their very own casino nights! Conclusion
 With a virtual endless list of video games from not only the four leading game consoles, the X Box 360, Playstation #, Nintendo Wii, and the Home PC, but also for all the vintage gaming consoles from the earlier generations, there is no better opportunity to start gaming today. Whether you like sport games, action games, first person shooter games, or role playing games, there is no shortage of games to be played. Even if you can’t afford to buy a new gaming counsel, used consoles are available in stores and online that will give you a significant discount when compared to the new price tag. These games are for all ages, and are no longer exclusively for men because there has been a recent influx of female gamers that have evened out the ranks on nearly all available games.
 


This is one hobby that is accessible to everyone, and not only can everyone play, but there is equal footing for all players because anyone can beat anyone on any game despite their sex. You can choose to play alone to test your skills against computer based players, or you can play online with people on the other side of the world from you. Just because you don’t speak their language, doesn’t mean they are a better or worse video game player. You just have to remember that when you play as Super Mario, his weaknesses are also everyone else’s weaknesses.",
Fly Fishing,"Fly Fishing Information Introduction Fly fishing is an angling method which uses flies that are cast with a special fishing rod and line. It can be practiced in either fresh or salt water. Freshwater fishing can be coldwater (trout, salmon, steelhead), coolwater (pike, perch, walleye), or warmwater (bass, chub, catfish) fishing. The freshwater fly fishing also differs in lakes, streams and rivers. Mastering the casting technique used in fly fishing is akin to an art form. Devoted fly anglers describe their sport as an art, an addiction or sometimes even a religion. Beginners might find fly fishing difficult to master, but it is a rewarding hobby that inspires loyalty among anglers. Successful fly fishing requires knowing the feeding patterns of targeted fish species, understanding the life stages of the creatures consumed by the targeted fish, and learning to tie complicated knots. Fly anglers may also choose to learn how to create the complicated fishing lures rather than buying them. Some veteran fly anglers claim the hobby creates a connection with nature which, when coupled with this new self-awareness, leads to spiritual awakening.  Learning the sport Beginners might find fly fishing to be a difficult and daunting pursuit at first. They must perfect a casting technique if they hope to catch a fish. And the casts must successfully “hit” a target that is swimming fast. Beginners must learn about the flies and insects eaten by the fish they are pursuing. They must learn how to tie a wide variety of knots. But expert fly anglers agree that learning these basics is well worth the effort due to the high degree of enjoyment found in fly fishing. To learn the sport, novices should read some of the many books written on fly fishing. Books on fly fishing are available at local libraries, and can be bought online or at local book stores. Instructional videos on fly fishing are another option for the beginner seeking more information. Check to see if there is a local fly fishing club. Visit a fly shop in the area and ask assistance from the staff. Tap the vast knowledge possessed by experienced fly anglers. Ask veteran fly fishermen for help. The fly fishing community is tight-knit, and members will likely be gratified to impart their wisdom to those new to the hobby. Beginning fly anglers may also learn more about the sport by taking a class. Classes and workshops are offered by fishing clubs, fly shops and sporting goods stores, and by fishing guides. An online search can help both the beginning fly fisherman and the experienced angler find classes on the sport. The famed outfitter Orvis offers classes at 14 fly fishing schools in the United States. Before buying fly fishing equipment, beginners should decide what fish they are targeting and what type of water they will be visiting. The answers to those questions determine what type of equipment is needed for the sport. Some expert fly fishermen suggest that beginners should initially buy a modestly priced fly fishing rod and reel to get used to the new hobby. Then they can supplement their fly fishing gear with new purchases after learning the basics in their new outdoor pursuit. Fly fishing gear can be costly. An angler can pay more than $700 for a fly fishing rod, but there are decent models costing approximately $100. A fly angler might pay more than $400 for a reel, but less expensive models are available for around $50. Despite the costs of fly fishing equipment, a beginner can get properly outfitted at a reasonable price by focusing on the basics and shunning the many tempting gadgets offered for sale. Beginners should also check out the sales offered by outfitters.  Types of fish Fly fishing is not just for pursuing trout, although that remains a dominant part of the sport. Fly anglers also pursue many species of both freshwater fish and saltwater fish. Freshwater fish varieties caught by fly anglers include perch, chub, catfish, salmon, bass, pike, panfish, grayling, rainbow trout, steelhead trout and golden trout. Saltwater varieties pursued by fly anglers include shark, surfperch, redfish, snook, tarpon, bonefish, halibut and marlin.  Tying flies Fly anglers can buy lures, but some choose to tie their own. Tying artificial flies is considered an art form among anglers. It requires studying the feeding habits of whichever fish species the angler is targeting, and understanding the life cycles of the creatures which the lures are designed to resemble. Anglers, either beginners or veterans, can learn to tie flies by reading books or watching videos. Numerous websites offer online instruction on tying flies. Types of lures Anglers may choose which fly to use during a fishing expedition by observing the insects in the water and in the air at their targeted fishing site. The word flies is used to describe fly fishing bait for both freshwater and saltwater fishing, but the lures resemble many life forms on which fish feed. These include crustaceans, insects, mammals, reptiles and amphibians. Artificial flies are either sub-surface flies which go below the water’s surface, or artificial lures are surface flies which stay on top of the water. Artificial flies are either imitators or attractors. Imitators mimic insects and fool the fish into striking. Attractors incite the fish into an aggressive response and strike. Dry flies are artificial lures that float on the surface. They typically resemble adult insects. Wet flies are artificial lures that sink under the water rather than floating on the surface. They resemble immature life forms which appear to be trying to swim to the water’s surface. Nymphs are artificial flies made to look like the immature stage of insects and crustaceans. Streamers are artificial flies that look like minnows and other creatures that are found swimming below the water’s surface.  Other gear for fly fishing The fly angler needs to buy a good-quality fly line that matches the rod and fishing conditions. Wading gear is traditionally used for protection from the water. Waders come in lengths that are hip high and chest high. Waders are manufactured in boot-foot style with the boots attached and in stocking-foot style with no boots. Some fly anglers in warm climates have been known to brave the water by forgoing waders and walking into the water sporting a pair of sturdy athletic shoes. A fishing vest with many large pockets is one of the most important pieces of gear worn by a fly angler. The vest holds everything needed for that particular fishing expedition. The vest must serve as a wearable tackle box because the fly angler is typically standing in water for prolonged periods and thus does not have easy access to these items. Some fly anglers use a wading staff to help keep their footing and prevent falling. Wading staffs, some of which are collapsible and costly, can be purchased at stores or online. But some anglers save money by fashioning a wading staff out of a broom handle or mop handle. Other accessories carried by fly anglers include sunscreen, insect repellant and first-aid kits. Additional gear needed by a fly angler includes flotation devices for personal safety, fly boxes for holding bait and forceps for removing hooks. A pair of polarized sunglasses will make the fish easier to see. A hat will serve many functions, including protecting the angler’s head and face from the sun, improving the angler’s ability to see the fish, and protecting the face from accidental collision with the hook and fly line.  Conclusion Mastering the sport of fly fishing takes effort, concentration and even a bit of money to obtain the necessary gear. But the rewards are great. Fly fishing aficionados describe the sport as an art, addiction and even a religion. Fly angling is gaining in popularity. The sport offers a rewarding experience in a beautiful, outdoor setting along with the camaraderie shared with other fly anglers.",
Massage,"Massage Information  Introduction Giving Massage is the act of rubbing, hitting, stroking or kneading another person’s body (superficial layers of muscles) using a massaging oil, lotion, cream or gel so that the functionality can be enhanced and the person feels relaxed. Massaging improves the circulation of body by bringing various nutrients as well as oxygen to the body tissues. 

The word comes from the French massage ""friction of kneading"", or from Arabic massa meaning ""to touch, feel or handle"" or from Latin massa meaning ""mass, dough"". 

Massaging is one of the oldest forms of therapy which is practiced on human body. Massages have different types and a number of massaging techniques and methods nowadays exists. Massage can be given to anyone regardless of age. It can be given to relax the body or may be used for treatment. Massage is a common practice seen in intensive cares, health clubs as well as clinics and hospitals. Massaging can be easily done at home as well. In order to give massage a person can lay down on a massage table, in a massage chair or by lying on a mat floor. Giving a massage can be done using fingers, hands, knees, elbows, forearms and even with the help of feet. Receiving a massage depends on the method as well as why you are receiving a massage. For instance, if it is to treat a problem, then massage method depends on the problem. Typically, a massage session can last between 15 minutes and 90 minutes in which the person receiving massage may be fully or partially clothed or completely unclothed. Using sheets or towels, parts of the body may be covered with only those parts revealing where a massage is to be given. 

There are many advantages of receiving a massage. It helps a person to relax, relieve tension, helps in reducing pain in joints and muscles, increases mobility and flexibility and so much more. A person feels a lot calm and relaxed after receiving a massage.

Massage Table: Without a massage table, a massage therapy is incomplete. It should be able to hold person of any weight. The table length should also be able to accommodate person of any size. 

Massaging Oils: In order to give a massage, different oils can be used which can be coconut oil, pecan oil, almond oil, mustard oil, olive oil, grape seed oil, hazel nut oil and many more. Massaging oils allows working smoothly over the skin. 

Massaging Lotion: It is an alternative to using massaging oils. Different types of massaging oils are available in the market. These lotions don’t penetrate into the skin quickly but conditions the skin, thus a great option when giving prolonged massages. Alternatively, one can also use massaging creams or gels. 

Towels: Different sized towels are available in the market. You should definitely have a towel with you when giving a massage. A towel can be used for many purposes for instance the person receiving massage may need it to remove excess of oil. 
Purchasing the Equipment The most important massaging equipment which requires attention is massage tables and chairs. There are variety of massage tables and chairs available in the market so you need to do some research in order to get the right equipment. Make sure you shop around and get to know the options available to you. Remember don’t jump on buying the first equipment you stumble upon and feel is the right one.

When considering a massaging chair, you should keep in mind few factors. You should be able to adjust the massaging chair according to the person receiving a massage. Remember, people vary in size as well as weight. Hence, you should be able to make adjustments to the chair depending upon height, head supports, chest pads or arm rests. It should feel comfortable to the person receiving a massage. Also, make sure the chair is strong enough to support any weight. 

For massage table, length is very much important. Table should be comfortable for a person of any height (or size). Another thing which you should be considered is the face cradle adjustment. The face shape of every person is not same so make sure the table has this feature and you can adjust accordingly. Massaging tables have cushioning. Make sure the cushion is really soft and plush. Remember, feeling comfortable and relaxed is very much important in massaging. You don’t want the person receiving a massage feel uncomfortable. 

Massage table should be durable as well so choose a table which is made from a durable material. The last thing which should be considered when considering a massage table is to see whether it is hard to assemble? You should opt for a table which is not hard to assemble at all. Also, the table should be portable i.e. you can easily move it from one place to another.

Autograph Collecting,"Introduction to Autograph CollectingINTRODUCTIONOn November 9, 1787, George Washington wrote a letter to his nephew, Bushrod Washington, laying out a series of arguments in support of adoption of the newly framed Constitution of the United States. Two hundred twenty-two years later, the letter was auctioned at Christie’s New York on December 4, 2009, setting a record price for a Washington autograph: $3,200,000. This is one of the highest prices currently ever paid for an American autograph.This is an extraordinary example of autography collection. This particular letter with George Washington’s signature had made its way back to England, and the family had squirreled it away until now. Who knows what rare gems lay within our reach?From baseball stars to politicians, obtaining a piece of either two seconds of fame or a piece of history, collecting autographs is certainly a great pastime, and many current collectors describe it as a passion.COSTAutography collecting can become very costly, depending on whose autographs you wish to collect. Many signatures can be had for the asking, but you have to go through the process of obtaining them, whether by mail or in person. There is always a risk when obtaining by mail because you don’t know for sure if the autograph is authentic, but all you are out is the cost of the envelopes and stamps.In an auction, signatures frequently go for several hundred to several thousand dollars. Here are some examples of autographs that were sold at auction. Unless noted, they are autographed pictures.Crew of Apollo 11- $900-1,200Charles Darwin- $10,600John F. Kennedy (while at Choate, a letter) - $2,500Abraham Lincoln (congratulatory note to King Christian of Denmark) - $7,500Winston Churchill - $2,800Marilyn Monroe (signed both as Norma Jean Dougherty and Marilyn Monroe in a letter to her agent) - $19,000SOME TIPS AND TRICKSFor clothing, Sharpie markers seem to work best.Ball point pens seem to be the most long lasting on baseballs.When writing a celebrity to ask for their autograph, do some research. Mention a favorite movie, and when mentioning the movie, mention a favorite scene. Tell that baseball player how you watched him make the game-winning catch one time. Make the letter personal.Include a self addressed stamped envelope and a pen or Sharpie. This way, all they have to do is sign and return. Make it easy for them.Try sending baseballs you want signed to yesterday`s stars that are now coaching. Send the balls during spring training in care of the team.Sometimes, they will ask for a donation for a pet charity in exchange for the autograph, but if it’s an autograph you really want, then it will be worth it- plus it’s a win-win situation. You benefit and the charity benefits.For getting that celebrity’s autograph in person, here are some thoughts.Be as respectful to everyone as possible. Remember that, like we all are, celebrities are people too. They have bad days like everyone does. They may not feel like signing every scrap of paper pushed under their noses.The security guard who is doing his job by keeping people back does not need to be spoken to rudely.Just as with writing the celebrity, try to know a little something about them. There is nothing more embarrassing than watching the celebrity sign the book or paper or whatever and ask- “So, what is your favorite movie?” and draw a blank.Just because you don’t live in Hollywood or New York does not mean you can’t meet someone in person. Check the newspaper to see who is coming to town for a political rally or fundraiser. You could also check IMDB’s website to see if there are any films shooting close to where you live. Sometimes, celebrities come into town just to meet their fans and sign autographs.When getting an autograph in person, you should bring a Sharpie with you and something for them to sign. An index card works well- collectors seem to prefer the cards with no lines. If you want to be a bit more creative, bring a CD for a singer, or a chef’s hat or apron for a celebrity chef.Show up early to the venue! By early, two to three hours early is the best, depending on who you are trying to meet. If you are there to see a concert, this puts you there before they start their sound checks. This is a prime time to ask for an autograph. If you happen to be at a movie premiere, showing up early allows you to choose a really good spot at the barrier.This also allows you time to find the backstage entrance and get a feel for the lay of the land. The stage door is usually located in the back of the building (hence backstage) and is usually out in the open. In the worst case scenario the backstage entrance is located underground or in a loading dock, where a limo or tour bus can actually drive into. In this case, security guards will probably stop anyone from going down to wait for autographs.Be patient! This is key to whether you are collecting by mail or in person- you have to be prepared to wait. Unless you know someone on the inside, there is no telling when a celebrity is going to show up to the event. Even then, some celebrities will say they cannot sign before the event, but will after and that will add at least another three hours onto your wait. It’s just part of the fun- you get to meet other collectors this way and trade stories. This is also an excellent time to get advice from other collectors- they may know something about a certain celebrity whose autograph you have always wanted to collect but have been unsuccessful in doing so.Don’t be upset if things don’t turn out the way you wanted them to. There is nothing quite so upsetting as finding out the movie star you have admired for so long, turn out to be a jerk. This doesn’t mean they all are jerks - most celebrities are very nice and willing to oblige their fans.CARE OF THE AUTOGRAPHFor autographs that are just on paper, or for a signed photograph, a large photo album is good for both presentation and preservation. Keep each item on its own page under the sleeve. Do not lay the albums down or stack anything on them- they should always be stored upright. The albums should always be kept away from moisture and heat- in a climate controlled room.If the autograph is to be displayed, then there are some care tips that the collector should be aware of. When the autograph (or signed picture) is being framed, always use a heavy mat board, or double mat; the autograph should never touch the glass. Keep the autograph away from direct sunlight, or any bright light. While it may be a temptation to frame that favorite celebrity’s autograph and display it with a light shining on it, resist that temptation! Exposure to light, artificial or sunlight will fade the autograph, thus ruining it.Taking care of clothing items or equipment, such as gloves or balls.Some collectors take great pride in wearing their sport hero’s jersey, with the autograph on it. This decreases the value of the autograph because it is being compromised each time it is worn and washed or dry cleaned. If the autograph is for bragging rights, then by all means, enjoy the accolades of friends. If it is obtained for an investment, then special care should be taken. The jersey or other clothing item should be kept on a good hanger and stored in an airtight garment bag in a climate controlled area. It should always be kept away from sunlight or other bright light. Do not handle the garment with bare hands and wear gloves to keep the oils from your skin from damaging the autograph over time.If the jersey is to be displayed, then take it to a professional framer, and ask them to double mat the frame with acid free mat board with non-glare glass. The autograph should not touch the glass! As with the other autographs, do not store this where it will receive direct sunlight or be under bright lights.As for baseballs, footballs, basketballs or soccer balls, they stay nice under a square acrylic or glass cover or in a display case with doors. The same rules about light apply here, as well as temperature controlled rooms.After a while, all things age. All paper turns yellow, and all clothing shows wear, whether it is being worn or not. Don’t worry that your prized piece is showing a little age, it will add to the authenticity of your item and it will add value to it as well.WRITING STYLEAn individual`s writing styles change throughout the lifespan of a person; a signature of President George Washington (c. 1795) will be different from one when he was an 18-year-old land surveyor. After British Admiral Nelson lost his right arm at the Tenerife sea-battle in 1797, he switched to using his left hand. However, the degree of change may vary greatly. The signatures of Washington and Lincoln changed only slightly during their adult lives, while John F. Kennedy`s signature was different virtually every time he signed.Other factors affect an individual`s signature, including their level of education, health, and so on. Blues singer John Lee Hooker had a limited education, and such is reflected in his handwriting. Composer Charles Ives and boxer Muhammad Ali both suffered from Parkinson`s disease and their handwriting show the effects of that condition as well. Native American Chief Geronimo had no concept of an alphabet; he ""drew"" his signature, much like a pictograph.Many individuals have much more fanciful signatures than their normal cursive writing, including elaborate ascenders, descanters and exotic flourishes, much as one would find in calligraphic writingAs an example, the final ""k"" in John Hancock`s famous signature on the United States Declaration of Independence loops back to underline his name. This kind of flourish is also known as a paraph. John Hancock`s signature on the Declaration of Independence is so unique and well-known that the phrase ""John Hancock"" has become a synonym for ""signature"" in American English, and a prominent piece of American iconography.CONCLUSIONAutograph collecting opens up a world of fun for a lifetime. Whether you are interested in collecting the autographs yourself by standing in line outside a venue, purchasing autographed items at shows or on EBay, or intend on asking for autographs through the mail, this is a sure way to keep a piece of history with you. Collecting autographs in person is totally unpredictable and you will find yourself constantly surprised on each new autograph outing. There are so many things that can happen in the process of collecting that you can never prepare for, but that`s part of the fun. Going to shows lets you talk to other collectors, and hear their stories of how they came to be in possession of the autographed items they are offering. It also lets you see just how varied the hobby is! Just remember to be patient, persistent, and polite and you`ll go far collecting autographs.",
Salsa,"Salsa Information  Intro The word ‘Salsa’ makes most people want to get up and dance! It is such fun to move to the beat of this music. The great thing about salsa is that just about anyone, regardless of age, can learn it and the atmosphere is totally friendly. That salsa is a major sensation is proved by the fact that there are so many salsa clubs drawing people with their infectious beat. You will see people of all nationalities dancing together, attracted by this wonderfully happy ambience. 

So it is not very surprising that you would like to take it up as a hobby, too. Learning salsa is a great way to meet a lot of new people and it is quite easy to learn. If you visit clubs, you’ll find that quite a few of them begin the evening with lessons for beginners and those who already know to salsa. Salsa involves rhythmic body movements and you will find that once you get started, it can be very difficult to stop! 
Let’s Take A Look At A Bit Of Salsa History Salsa is considered the national dance in Puerto Rico and is similar to Mambo. Salsa in Spanish actually means spicy flavor. Back in the year 1933, Piniero, the Cuban songwriter penned some lyrics after eating food that was not spicy enough. Much later, in 1962 Jimmy Sabater composed the Salsa y Beme, encouraging dancers to add spice to their dance movements. The music can resemble Afro-Latin rhythms. So as far as the dance goes, it can be performed to various rhythms. 

You will find that there are various styles of salsa – Cuban, Puerto Rican, Columbian, Brazilian, New York Miami, Los Angeles style and so on. All of them are great to learn as they are simply a result of different teaching styles with the dance form evolving through the times.   
How Is Salsa Performed? Salsa is performed to four basic beats with three steps, with each step to a beat. The fourth beat is special – and called a tag to the earlier step or becomes a tap or kick, as a highlight. You can either salsa in a single spot or just move around dancing. The steps can be from side to side or forward-backward and in circles. Salsa can be similar to mambo, swing and hustle. 

Famous Salsa artists are Albita, Marc Anthony, West End Mambo, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, the Latin Explosion etc. 

Apart from being a great way to meet new people, salsa dancing is a wonderful social activity and can develop good poise and self-confidence. It is also great as a keep-fit workout. Through dance, you can burn the same number of calories as with swimming and walking and cycling! It is also a great stress-reliever and helps you relax. 
Learning Salsa To learn salsa, you could sign up for private dance lessons where you can receive personalized attention from trained teachers. Group classes are also offered by many dance schools where they teach you the basic steps you need to get started. You will also come across ‘drop-in’ classes where you can go and learn occasionally after which you get to practice your steps with a partner if you wish. One great thing about salsa is that you can dance with or without a partner, and most teachers encourage you to try different partners. Some teachers hold series classes where you need to register for about four weeks and you can build your skills gradually. 

Obviously private lessons are considered better since you can choose the speed at which you want to learn and you will also get the benefit of your teacher telling you exactly where you need to improve. Most schools will let you experience a free introductory session before you make up your mind. These could be more expensive than group classes, so you can decide what suits you best. Don’t forget to attend the workshops held to give students a better understanding of the techniques. 

Salsa teachers will teach you both lead and follow. This is generally ‘lead’ for men and ‘follow’ for women. Remember that women and men learn differently with men invariably finding it tougher to learn. Also, each individual has his or her own learning rate. 
Salsa Attire And Shoes Salsa is fun and salsa is informal – so go ahead and dress casually and comfortably unless you are off to a party! It is best to wear something that is smart, casual, cool and easy to move in. As for shoes, preferably go in for leather soles that are comfortable. Avoid rubber soles as they can be tough to dance in. Women can wear closed toe shoes as sandals or open ones could be painful if a learner happens to step on their toes! Try shopping for dancing shoes that are light and flexible with non-slip soles. You must master your basic salsa steps so that you subconsciously perform them perfectly – only then can you truly enjoy this hobby, as most of the dancing comes from within you. You can, however, hone your skills by practicing this exciting dance form. There are links to lessons, so that you can develop your salsa skills. There are plenty of instructional videos and useful books that will tell you all that you need to know about salsa. So, move to the groove!",
Triathlon,"Triathlon Information Introduction If you’re a fitness guru and enjoy pushing yourself to the limit, training for a triathlon could be a great hobby for you. The traditional form of this multi-sport event involves swimming, biking and running consecutively at varying distances. 

In order to train for a triathlon, you’ll need access to a swimming pool and a bicycle that is suitable for racing. For most races, you must sign up in advance and often have to pay to register. One of the most popular triathlons is called the Ironman. 

One of the things that makes triathlons unique is that they are very endurance-focused. Because participants have to swim, run and bike several miles, they must be able to withstand an intense amount of fitness. 

Distances that participants must swim, run and cycle during a triathlon vary depending on which triathlon they are competing in. Also, there is such a thing as a half triathlon, hosted by Ironman. 

The triathlon became an Olympic sport at the summer games in 2000. The distances of the Olympic triathlon are much shorter than the Ironman or long distance triathlon. 

While professionals do compete in triathlons, anyone can participate. However, a full Ironman triathlon, which consists of swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles and running 26.2 miles, can be very rigorous on the body. Therefore, it is recommended that one train for a triathlon properly in order to be prepared. 

Training for a triathlon is not necessarily an expensive hobby, however, you must be able to use a swimming pool or other body of water, as well as a bicycle in order to train. Buying a used bicycle is always an option and various training programs can be found online. 

The most important thing when taking up triathlon training as a hobby is that you have to enjoy endurance fitness. You must also have the amount of time that it takes to train for this competition. 
Ironman The Hawaiian Ironman Triathlon was the first Ironman triathlon, as well as the first long distance triathlon in the United States. The race consisted of 2.4 miles of swimming, 112 miles of biking and 26.2 miles of running, which is equivalent to running a marathon. 

For most Ironman events, participants must complete the triathlon in 17 hours. In Japan, participants are only given 15 hours to complete the race. The World Triathlon Corporation organizes the races. 

At the Oahu Perimeter Relay in 1977, a race for teams of five people, both runners and swimmers participated. The team members had spent a long time arguing over whether runners or swimmers were more fit. John Collins, US Navy Commander, was present at the time and said that he had just read in Sports Illustrated that cyclist was the most fit athlete of all because his oxygen uptake was the highest on record. Therefore, he suggested that the argument should be settled by instituting a race that consisted of combining all three sports. At the time, a long-distance race for swimming, running and cycling existed in Hawaii, so he decided to just put them together to create the Ironman. The name was thought of by Collins when he said that whoever won the race would be called the “Iron Man.” 

Ironman races in the United States take place in Arizona, New York, Wisconsin and Idaho, among others. There are also Ironmans in Europe, Australia, Brazil, China and New Zealand, as well as a few other countries. The Ironman World Championships is held annually in Hawaii and has been held there since 1978. 
Triathlon Equipment If you’re just beginning to train for a triathlon for the first time, you’ll need to know what kind of equipment is required. The equipment you need will vary, depending on whether or not you plan to compete competitively.  
Swim In order to train for the swimming portion of a triathlon, you will need a body of water in which to train. You can use either a pool or a lake, but a pool is best because you can measure the distance you’re swimming. If you aren’t necessarily a competitive person, you will need a pair of reliable goggles, a bathing suit and a wet suit. A wet suit isn’t a must-have, but it keeps you warmer in cold water, as well as aids with buoyancy. More competitive swimmers will find that a kickboard, paddles and a pull buoy will help with training as well.  
Bike For those less competitive participants, the type of bike you use doesn’t particularly matter. However, your bike must be in good enough shape to get you through the triathlon, especially if you will be participating in an Ironman. Both fitness bikes and mountain bikes will work, but mountain bikes should have smoother tires, generally seen on road bikes. 

An entry-level road bike can be purchased for a few hundred dollars, but if you plan to use this bike a lot in the future, you may want to consider investing in a higher quality bike. Competitive athletes should look for bikes that are very light. These bikes, which are often made of carbon fiber, place the rider in an aerodynamic position and are designed as to not fatigue a rider’s legs too much before running. However, these bikes can cost $1,000 or more. 

There are three types of pedals made for bikes. These are basic pedals, cliples pedals and cages, also known as clips. The basic pedal is what we normally see on most bikes, as it is flat. The other two types of pedals are best for riding long distances. Clipless pedals are the most efficient types of pedals for racing. On this pedal, you clip your foot to the top of the pedal. Cages are pedals that you put your foot all the way into to prevent it from sliding around. 

Competitive riders must have clipless pedals. They may feel uncomfortable at first, especially because you feel stuck, but once you train yourself properly, you will gain the most speed from using this type of pedal. If you use clipless pedals, you must have the correct type of shoe to go with them. They should have mount points and hard soles. 

Regardless of what type of bike you pick out, you must be sure that it is the right size for your height. If you are riding the wrong size bike, you will be both uncomfortable and slow.  
Run Whether you are competitive or not, you should buy shoes from a running store, rather than a discount store. It is not worth being injured from wearing the wrong type of shoes or cheap shoes. By visiting a running store, you can be fitted for the proper shoes for your feet. Also, be sure to buy new running shoes every few months, especially if you’re running nearly every day. The soles of the shoes wear down quickly when they are pounding pavement constantly. 
Triathlon Preparation
Base Training Base training does as it says—gives you a strong base to compete in a triathlon. If you are a beginner, base training is a good way to work up to the distances you’ll need to swim, run and bike in the triathlon. To do this type of training, you should make most of your workouts sustainable. This means, distances and paces that don’t overwork you. 

If you are just beginning to train for a triathlon for the first time, you need a long base period in order to work up to higher intensity workouts. Building a base safely and correctly requires a lot of patience that many people don’t have. However, if you do not build this base, you will be trying to race at full speed with a small engine. 

In order to build a base, you should do only aerobic workouts for three months. When you work out, give yourself between five and 15 minutes to let your heart rate elevate slowly. For the rest of the workout, your heart rate should stay at 80% of your maximum aerobic rate. No matter what aerobic activity you are doing, you should maintain this practice. Then, after three months, you will be better prepared to take your training to the next level.  
Sign up for a Training Schedule There are tons of free training schedules online that you can sign up for based on your triathlon goals. These websites also allow you to keep a log of your daily workouts. You must be sure to follow a schedule created by a professional so that you don’t over work yourself. Also, make sure that you are taking enough rest to let your body re-energize. Training obviously includes swimming, running and biking at various speeds and distances, as well as weight and cross training. Cross training activities can include yoga and using the elliptical machine.  
Registration Be sure that you register and pay for the triathlon you will be competing in on time. You don’t want to run the risk of not being able to compete after all the hard training you put yourself through.  
Nutrition Eating right will help you stay on track while training for a triathlon. Using a food journal can be a useful tool in order to keep track of what is going into your body each day. You may be surprised at what you’re eating and have the power to stop bad habits if you keep a record of what you eat. 

Staples for those training for a triathlon should be fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean meats and other proteins. Also, eating a healthy, balanced breakfast and small meals throughout the day is beneficial to those training in order to satisfy hunger and keep energy levels up. 

When people train for triathlons, they must be sure that they don’t give in to sugar cravings, especially right after a workout, when they are more likely to give into intense hunger pangs.  
Fitness Partner Finding a fitness partner can be the key to success when training for a triathlon. Whether your partner is more or less athletic than you doesn’t necessarily matter. It is cheaper than a trainer and gets you going everyday and keeps you motivated. Also, you do not need to train with your partner every day, but can simply keep it to a few times a week. It is generally positive to be in touch with someone else who is training for a triathlon and who will hold you responsible for keeping up with your workouts.  
Injury Because of the immense amount of strain being put on your body while you train for a triathlon, it is easy to become injured. Common triathlon injuries include runner’s knee, swimmer’s shoulder and Achilles tendonitis. Injuries can occur from overworking your body or simply from neglecting to stretch before or after a workout. 

Most commonly, injuries are associated with running and biking because swimming is a low-impact sport. However, it’s possible to pull a muscle or develop swimmer’s shoulder, which is an inflammatory response from constantly moving your arm overhead. 

It is crucial that you visit a doctor if your injury is serious. Also, you should always consult with a physician or a professional trainer if you are injured regarding your training. The worst thing you can do is make your injury worse by training harder than you should, rather than giving it time to heal.",
Dominoes,"Dominoes Information  Intro The game of Dominoes is something that most of us are familiar with. Invariably the choice for a wet day when you can’t get outdoors, dominoes are played by both children and adults with equal relish. It is not difficult to learn to play dominoes and it can be a fun hobby with the variety of games at various levels of proficiency. Of course, you can also make up your own games and have a terrific time. 

Dominoes are enjoyed all over the world. The game has its origins in China around the 12th century. Around the 18th century, Europeans began to play it, and in current times, it is a popular club game there. Today, everyone, regardless of age, race or geographical constraint, plays dominoes. Interestingly, many countries in Latin America name Dominoes as their national game. In the US, dominoes are a hot favorite at parties. While there are game rules associated with Dominoes, they do tend to vary slightly depending on where they are played. It is always best to check the prevailing rules at the specific place where you intend to participate in the game. 
Getting Started With Dominoes Getting started with dominoes is fairly simple. All you need is the following: 

- Dominoes - Pencils and Scoring pads - Card Tables - Chairs 
The Domino Set You will play dominoes with a set of tiles used especially for the game you are participating in. The domino tile corresponds to the roll of two dice. The domino set will have a fixed number of pieces or tiles, which are identical in shape and size. Each tile or ‘bone’ is rectangular has a face and a back. The faces are unique and divided into two halves by a line. Each end has a number. Players refer to the domino by the number of dots or pips on each end. The lower number is listed first. If you have a tile with 2 and 5, then you call it a 2-5 tile. Tiles that have the same number on both ends are called ‘doublets or doubles’. A tile with the number six at both ends is a double six, which is the heaviest domino. A tile with zero at both ends is a double blank and the lightest domino. All the players taking part in the game will know the particular domino set used for the game and its tiles. Tiles with the same number of dots at both ends are said to be a part of the same ‘suit’. 

There are different kinds of domino sets, just as there are different games. In the double-six domino set, numbers vary from 0-6, so that there are 28 tiles and seven suits. 

You also get larger sized sets like the double nine with 55 tiles, double twelve with 91 tiles and so on. These are used for the more intricate games with more players. 

Let us now look at how the players are arranged and what actually happens during the game. 
Player Arrangement In a game of dominoes, the players sit in a circle, equidistant from each other, around the table, on which the tiles will be played. The players sit facing the table but cannot see each other’s tiles. 
The Game The tiles are thoroughly mixed or shuffled, face down on the table. During this shuffle, players shall not look at the tiles’ faces. The shuffled tiles are called the boneyard. Once this is done, the tiles are dealt to the players. Dealing can be clockwise or counterclockwise. Games from North America, north and west Europe and Russia are dealt clockwise, while games from south and east Europe, Asia and Switzerland is dealt counterclockwise. 

Each player now gets a set of tiles, called their hand. If there are remaining tile in the boneyard they are placed aside, still face down to leave the center of the table clear for the game. The players hold their set of tiles with the faces of the tiles visible only to them, just like you hold your cards in a card game. 

The game now begins. To decide who makes the first move each player chooses a random domino. Whoever holds the heavier domino plays first. These dominos now go back to the boneyard to be shuffled again. Another way to decide who plays first is for the players to draw their tiles, depending on the game. Then the holder of the heaviest domino gets to play first. 

The game ends when a player has played all the tiles or when the game is ‘blocked’. A game can also end after a specific number of hands have been played or when the player/team has made the winning points. When a player has played all the tiles in her hand, she must announce ‘domino’ which means the other players have been “dominoed”. If the other players cannot add another tile, the game is blocked, ending it. 
Different Types Of Dominoes Games As you learn the basics and nuances of the game, you can enjoy a lot of simple games like Block dominoes, Draw Dominoes, Chickenfoot and Matador. Forty-Two, the national game of Texas is similar to a card game. If you want to play point games, you can try Five-Up and Muggins. Mexican Train is a rage in North America and even has its own set of dominoes. 

Domino games can be broadly categorized into 

- Bidding games - similar to card games with two to four players. Players bid their hands with the highest bidder naming the suit. The bid determines the score. 

- Blocking games – played by matching domino tiles in a line. Scoring is at the end of each hand. 

- Scoring games – similar to blocking games but scoring is throughout the game after each scoring play and at the end of each hand. 

- Round games – popular at parties involving 3-10 players. Each hand is a game. 

- Connecting games – most commonly played by forming lines of tiles. - Capture games – further divided into trick taking or tableau games.   There is a lot more to the game of dominoes – different techniques and tactics. The variety of games you can play ranges from the very easy to the really tough. 

The information in this article is only aimed at getting you started. To know more, and for tips to help you play a mean game of dominoes, do visit the following website and watch the instructional videos and excellent books on the Dominoes that cover it in depth. Videos are great at teaching since you can see professional players in action. You will also find valuable links that can tell you all that you want to know about Dominoes.

Break Dancing,"Break Dancing Information  Intro Whether you want to impress your friends or participate in dance competitions, or just have fun – break dancing is an exciting hobby. A skilled break-dancer will always grab everyone’s attention instantly with the complex moves, keeping up with the pace of the music. 

Break dancing is an energetic street style dance where you perform amazingly intricate moves but appear completely in coordination with your body. Break-dancers are called b-boys or b-girls, depending on their gender. 

This dance form is also a wonderful way to keep fit since you need plenty of balance, a strong body and a fit heart. As you become better at this form of dance art, you will gain self-confidence as you face your fans across the floor. 
Break Dance – Its Origins Even though break dancing has been around since the 1960’s, it became popular in the 1970’s and 1980’s in New York with the African American people. It is believed that it might have had its roots in the ‘Lindy Hop’ and the Charleston but there is no right way to break dancing as it is adapted by the dancers all the time, borrowing from other dance forms and arts. However, we can say that James Brown takes the credit for popularizing break dancing back in the late 1960’s. This dance style that was called Good foot at this time began to be called the b-boy a little later. Soon after came DJ Afrika Bambaataa with their dexterity in mixing music and transforming break dancing into what we see it as, in current times. Breakdancing also has its origin from the South Bronx when Kool DJ Herc mixed and matched various beats of music, creating a rhythm – and break dancing. What started as a casual dance form is now being offered as an option by dance schools – opening up a lot of scope for the performer, helping them become professional break-dancers or giving them a gateway into the movies. You might find it hard to believe that you can make a career out of this dance form – but you have very good chances of performing in music videos, dancing on shows – and depending on who is producing it, you can earn good cash. Auditions will give you the exposure and open the doors to bigger projects. 
Where To Start When You Learn Break Dancing It is important to get used to the basic moves first, before you can try any of the ‘power’ stuff. It is also important to practice a lot because, especially with break dancing, you must become good at it while avoiding injury to yourself. The best way to do this is by getting an instructor who is qualified to teach you how to do this. Your instructor will also teach you the right exercises to warm up – like stretching to relax your muscles before you begin your break dancing so that your chances of getting hurt are minimized. Some sore muscles and some minor injury are inevitable, but with guided instruction, you can quickly learn to avoid these. 

While learning to spin during a headstand, most learners use a helmet and then move on to a cushioned hat until they can perform it well enough to do it without any protection. Some moves are quite complex in break dancing and that is why it is advisable to learn with someone who is accomplished in this dance form. For some moves, back protection is worn for support. Sometimes wrist supports are also worn if the entire body weight has to be borne on the palms. Just before performances, many break-dancers powder their hands since this makes hand spins easier. Some also wear gloves. 
Developing Your Own Style Of Break Dancing Break dancing is a lot of fun, but to get really good at it, it calls for a lot of concentrated effort and persistence. Rather than just learning a particular way to perform the footwork, you must develop your unique style in a natural way. This needs plenty of practice. There are plenty of online break dancing schools that do a good job of teaching you the basics. Now let us get familiar with a few moves you will learn when you take up break dancing:  
Basics: Top rock and up rock – this is the footwork you learn to establish your own style. Down rock and six-step involve footwork on the ground. The sweeping movement you see break-dancers performing with their legs on the ground is the coffee grinder.

Pilates,"Pilates Information  Why Pilates? Originally used to rehabilitate bedridden patients during World War I, Pilates has now become a popular form of exercise for dancer, gymnasts, and even some of the top Hollywood actors. Pilates is essentially a body conditioning routine that boosts overall fitness of mind and body. The Pilates method comprises of different mat exercises or those that require equipment to strengthen body muscles and toning. One reason why people are so attracted to this form of exercise is that it can be used to enhance flexibility, endurance and co-ordination without increasing muscle bulk. Also used widely to build up the ‘powerhouse’ of the body or ‘torso’, people doing plates regularly are too happy with the health benefits they derive from it. It increases blood circulation and women are inspired to do Pilates to get their bodies back in shape. What more! Those who do Pilates exercises regularly are less prone to injury and usually have a better posture as well. With myriad of benefits that come with Pilates, it’s not difficult to guess why Pilates is gaining so much popularity. We owe a lot to Joseph H. Pilates, the founder of the Pilates exercise method, who was influenced by other exercising methods across the world including Yoga and Chinese martial arts. He strongly believed that there is a strong connection between mental and physical health and therefore developed the Pilates method that was aimed at improving overall health. If you are keen on learning the Pilates style of exercising, this article can help you get started on this healthy and invigorating hobby.  Getting started From couch potatoes to fitness freaks, Pilates is for everyone who has a passion for exercise. As a Pilates enthusiast, you can choose to do Pilates in the form of mat exercises that are quite popular and all you need is a bit of training and a floor mat to get started. On the other hand, Pilates can also be done using different machines that help you to tone your body using the principle of resistance. Due to the ever-increasing popularity of Pilates, there are plenty of classes out there that can help you learn the Pilates techniques. If mat work is what you are looking for, you will come across several fitness centers and YMCAs that offer Pilates classes for beginners. Another option is to attend private classes offered by Pilates instructors that usually combine both mat work and machine work to give you the best results. In case you are planning to join a health club that gives you an access to Pilates machines, make sure that you exercise under the guidance of a qualified Pilates instructor who can teach you the right method of doing each exercise. Although Pilates classes are springing up everywhere, you need to choose one carefully. Agreed, Pilates is hot and you just can’t wait to start off in one of the classes in your neighborhood. But the sad part of some of these classes is that they provide inadequate instruction. In an effort to cash in on the popularity of Pilates, many gymnasiums and health centers send their staff to attend weekend courses and later claim of having qualified personal trainers who can teach Pilates. The fact is that they are not qualified and learning Pilates from such trainers can lead to injury. The best way is to find a trainer who is certified by a group that is known for offering extensive and rigorous training programs for Pilates. With so much of training, these trainers become a Pilates expert in the true sense. Pilates trainers can even modify the exercises just to make sure that novices can learn it easily without getting hurt. When following the Pilates mat program, you need to perform one exercise after the other in a set sequence that Joseph Pilates had designed. While beginners are required to do only certain basic exercises, those undergoing advanced training are given exercises that require advanced positioning. To get the most out of your Pilates workout, you need to do it the right way at the right time. Follow these simple tips and enjoy the most rejuvenating experience following a Pilates workout. Staying focused is the key – It’s important that you synchronize your breathing rhythm with the body movements and this can be achieved through various techniques that are taught by qualified instructors. They also teach you to concentrate on muscles and as such on every exercise you are doing in order to unite your mind and body. This will alleviate stress and anxiety keeping your body fit and strong at the same time. Staying focused is critical for the getting the most out of Pilates exercises. Wear comfortable clothes – As any other form of exercise, Pilates enthusiasts also need to choose their clothes wisely and ideally go for the ones that are of a comfortable fit. Most prefer to wear shorts or tights along with a tank top or T-shirt to be able to attain the right postures required in Pilates exercising method. Pilates does not allow you to wear shoes while exercising. Stop exercising if there is pain or discomfort. Maintain a rhythm – Its pointless to perform Pilates exercises if your movements are quick and jerky. Although movements need to be strong, you must ensure that they are slow and seem almost like a dance. This is how Joseph Pilates wanted it to be when he worked with dancers before designing the movements that are known everywhere as Pilates exercises today. The best part about Pilates exercising is that you don’t have to sweat if you don’t want to however, you can speed up the exercises to attain the require heart rate. Pilates is all about strength and flexibility, and you can therefore pair it with an aerobic form of exercise of your choice to get the best results. Many Pilates enthusiasts have combined their Pilates exercise regime with swimming or brisk walking for better health and fitness. Pilates is extremely popular because of its diversity. For many, the idea of doing fewer repetitions of several exercises is far more appealing than doing lots of repetitions of fewer exercises that makes the whole ordeal very monotonous. Joseph Pilates wanted to promote an exercising method that people could do on their own once they received formal training from an expert Pilates trainer. This gave them the much-needed freedom to follow an exercise routine that could be done anywhere anytime.    Continuing Oh yes, hobbies, who wouldn’t just love to be lost in his/her world of hobbies, doing something they just love, following their passions and spending their spare time in some sort of recreational pursuit. Yeah, that’s what all hobbies are about and it’s always good to have one too if you have nothing else on your agenda. There are so many things that you can take up as a hobby, flying kites (may be not), collecting stamps and coins, photography, etc. And if you’re one of those who’re like the outdoor kind of guys, hobbies like hiking, rock climbing, bungee jumping, nature trailing, cycling, etc. may simply seem to be perfect. And then of course, there are those hobbies that could help you physically and mentally as well. Where are we going with all of this? These few exceptional hobbies that would help in the overall development of individuals would include names like yoga, martial arts, Pilates, etc. Previously, we had discussed about Pilates, i.e., its history, its uses, its effects, the requirements, etc., which is nothing but a basic picture of what Pilates was all about. Now, we’ll simply turn this topic about Pilates up a notch and go on in detail explaining the advantages of this activity and its progression through the ages. As a hobby, Pilates is perhaps the best thing that you can choose because remember, it’s not just a hobby, it’s also a way to lose some of that extra flab that you have been carrying along all these years. I mean lets admit it, with the current busy schedules that we all have, the reason for the excess “junk in the trunk” is simply because of poor metabolism rates. If this continues, we’re all bound to be led to obesity which by the way is inevitable, unless you plan on doing something about it. The trick is that you have to get yourself to change your metabolism rate and what better way than “pilates”. But hey, don’t get us wrong now, we’re NOT asking you to take up this activity as a regime of some sort. On the contrary, the best way to do this would be do advocate Pilates as you very own hobby. Besides, once you get into this fitness system and view it as a hobby at the same time, you will surely find some time to give away for this workout system-turned-hobby of yours. We all know that feeling when you’re dreaming of simply reaching out to that perfect chocolate filled cookie in the jar, which has the perfect amount of chocolate chips in it and before you know it, you’re already there relishing away the cookie with your taste buds giving you the ultimate satisfaction that you had craved for in the first place. What could be better than using our own mind to control our muscles? This simply means that Pilates is nothing but training the mind effectively through certain movements thereby teaching the human body how to move correctly, where every movement is choreographed to perfection. Sounds pretty enticing, doesn’t it? Having Pilates as a hobby could be a great decision not just with respect to investing your time, which could be a boon for your physical development, but also to calm your mind. C’mon, wouldn’t you just love to have your favorite Pistachio ice cream and not giving a damn about the calories you’re taking in? That’s because regular Pilates practice takes care of all those worries. Just a normal set of Pilates a day and you’re on your way towards a healthy lifestyle and getting all of this simply with a hobby, that’s just a bargain that you cannot ignore. Pilates is definitely evolving, ever since Joseph Pilates invented this fitness system way back in the early 20th century. And all thanks to him, now we’ve got what I’d like to call “Pilates hybrids” which simply mean other activities combined with Pilates to make the whole Pilates concept a bit different. However, that doesn’t mean that Pilates is turning faces against its religious followers. One thing to remember in this respect is that no matter what, Pilates form the core of these “other” activities. Let’s look at some of them, shall we? Starting off with “Yogilates” which by the sound of it itself gives you an idea that it’s nothing but a blend of yoga and pilates. This was designed by a Pilates instructor who was also a yoga practitioner. This method promises to provide an individual with a rather complete exercise regime with the same benefits that yoga and Pilates tend to provide, but in this case, providing them together for better results. In Yogilates, the practitioner starts off the class with the simple mat exercises with poses ranging from stances in Pilates to yoga slowly progressing to more challenging poses. So many celebrities are out there that swear by the benefits of Pilates. And speaking of celebrities and Pilates, how can we possibly forget Tangolates? Sure, we all know that the singer Sting is all into this technique but what exactly is it? All it does is blend the methods used in Pilates and Tango, yes, Tango, moving in a distinct way to the tunes of tango music in the background. But this requires a partner just as in the tango that differs exponentially from the concept used otherwise in case of Pilates. It is truly an inspired version of our modern day Pilates technique. Gravity Pilates is another form that utilizes “gravity” as a form of resistance under training. This basically means that your body is also used as resistance for training purposes thereby providing you an intense workout for strength, stretching and endurance training. So there you have it, but the thing we’d like to stress on is that Pilates is the core of all of the above-mentioned variations, so why not take it up as a hobby? Exercises like the double leg stretch and all could make your abdominal muscles really strong and all of this achieved with the help of a hobby, what more could you ask for?",
Gun and Pistols,"Gun and Pistols InformationINTRODUCTIONA firearm is a device which projects single or many projectiles at high speeds through a controlled explosion.HISTORYFor centuries weapons have fascinated men. Men have ever since tried to develop more advance form of weaponry. The invention of gunpowder was preceded by the development of firearms. The gunpowder dates back to 850 A.D. and was invented by Chinese. The Silk Road helped it transport to the West along with silk and paper. The alchemists discovered the gunpowder by accident while searching for the elixir of life.Earlier the use of gunpowder was only made in firecrackers and the first military use of the gunpowder was not made until 919 A.D. Gunpowder filled the bombs and catapults by the 11th century in China. Proves are found of the ‘firing canon’ being used by the Song army in 1126 against the Nuchens. The firing canon actually was a bamboo tube filled with gunpowder. When the tube was lit, it would form the projectile of a flaming missile through the air. The bamboo tube made it difficult for the missile to cover a long distance so the fire canons were placed close to the walls of the city from where they would fire it.The gunpowder was not developed much and soon was abandoned as it had no military use. By 13th century it was adopted in Europe and Japan and then Arabs enhanced the gunpowder for the military use. The Arabs then used the gunpowder against the Spanish and by 1326, cannons and cannon balls had been started manufacturing. The gunpowder soon got popular in Europe and emerged as a powerful weapon by 1350s.One mole of the mixture of sulfur, potassium nitrite and charcoal when ignited would give off 6 moles of gas. This is the reason of such huge explosions. This instantaneous expansion in closed spaces drives the projectile at high speeds in a particular direction. The latest gunpowder being used is made in such a way as to produce more explosive content and lesser amount of residue. The efficient gunpowder in use today has unique compositions and its residue can be analyzed later on which helps the forensic scientists.The Chinese hence came up with the gun by 12th century. The gun dated back to 1290 A.D. and was found in Pan-la-ch’eng-tzu village. Hence the advent of the use of firearms for military purposes took place. Gone were the days of swords and arrows. The hand held guns replaced them all and during the sixteenth century the firearms were perfected.The very first sued gun was the matchlock. Gunpowder in a flash pan was ignited by the burning of a match cord. This then ignited the powder inside a barrel which then fired the ball in the direction of its target. But the mechanism was imperfect because the lighting of the match cord could be easily detected by the enemy at dark. Moreover the presence of powder so close to spark was perilous and caused many accidents too.After that came the wheel lock which provided a safer and more mature solution to firearm. A serrated spring wheel was placed against iron pyrite. The tightly wound wheel was turned when the trigger was pulled hence creating sparks which in turn lighted the powder inside the lock. But this too had its shortcomings. It came at a huge price and its maintenance was difficult.Then the soldiers were provided with the cheaper yet more reliable and user friendly firearm known as the flintlock. By the thumb cocking mechanism, hammer was attached with a small piece of flint. The flash pan was filled with a little gunpowder and to protect it a lock was pulled down. The hammer was released with the pulling of the trigger. As it is pulled, the lock is struck by the flint, pushing it out of the way while creating a spark. The spark then lighted the powder. The gun provided a cheap solution yet did not compromise on quality. The gun became largely popular in its era.The guns could aim better with longer bores. But in 18th century there was a constraint to the size of the weapon a person could carry. Gunsmith of the time suggested that placing spiral grooves in the bore would increase the accuracy of hitting a target because the groove would impart a spin to the ball. But today modern guns don’t have the grooves to reduce the problem of powder remaining unburned.Instead of the grooves, rifling was used. Rifling was the metal grooves with twist inside the barrel. The rifling gave a spin to the bullet inside it when fired. The spinning of the bullet rendered it stability and made it perfect for distant targets. The accuracy was also hence improved.For different weapons, different rifling is there. Each type of weapon has its own unique pattern of deformation. These patterns help the forensic scientists for identification of a specific weapon.Then came the machine guns during the World Wars 1 and 2. The modern weaponry utilizes the principle of the expansion of gases so much that the force is enough to cycle the system to fire bullets repeatedly. The machine gun is capable of firing up to 600 rounds per minute.The main mechanism of firing involves the use of kinetic energy to force the projectile motion of the bullet. Earlier to increase the kinetic energy of bullets the diameter of the bore was increased. As kinetic energy is proportional to square of the velocity, the second method relies on the increasing of the velocity by increasing the gunpowder. By using the jacket of a metal like copper which helped the bullet glide through the barrel freely, velocity was increased. These bullets are called the ‘full metal jacket’. These bullets are capable of passing through their targets while transferring less energy. These bullets result in damaging tissue less as compared to other non-jacketed bullets. So countries following The Hague Convention in 1899 adopted these for military use.HOW TO START A GUN COLLECTIONGun collection is an interesting hobby for passionate people who are interested in history design and artistry of guns. A gun collection shows the trends of an era and also explains the functions of guns used in a particular war. But if someone is really interested in this hobby then he must have a clear idea of where to start with. The gun must be declared as not among the ‘destructive devices’. The guns which are of the collector’s interest can be bought or sold without the federal license. The gun is only considered as a collector’s item under the National Firearms Act. Follow the steps to get the perfect gun collection.1. ResearchThis is the very initial step that one may take. There is loads of information in books, magazines and over the internet. There are exclusive magazines featuring guns and there are books which give information about guns from past till present age. Go through articles which tell about the guns which can be a part of the collection and where they can be found. Learn as much as you can before you start off with the collection.There are loads of gun clubs which you can join to gain information about the latest trends in guns collection. You may ask the members to guide you to start your own gun collection. Meet people who have been collecting guns to get guidance.Internet is one place where you can get any kind of information. If you need to know about the license for curio and relic firearms then you may visit the website of At The Frontline Against Violent Crimes (ATF).2. Types of gunsThere are many different kinds of guns in the world and after you are done with the research you would be able to decide on which guns you would want to include in your collection. Sometimes there are some antique pieces which are not so easily available so it’s better to start off with collecting guns which are not so rare. You must know that gun collection would cost you money and there would be many guns which would be really expensive. So be ready to spend for your hobby.

3. AuthenticationAs you are new to the field, it would be difficult for you to identify a real gun. There will be many people who would try to sell you fake guns. Don’t fall for their traps and for the authentication get help from some expert on guns.
4. The National Firearms Act (NFA) has issued proper guidelines for the registration and transfer procedures for the guns. You must review the act to abide by the procedure.5. If you have any doubts you must contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) or NFA.6. The best place to start your collection from is a gun show. The gun shows are open for general public and can give loads of information of the guns.7. Another great place to find good reliable guns are at some auction. At the auction there are dealers as well as gun owners. You are free to attend any live auction or bid over some online auction.8. Through BATF you must ask for a curio or relic determination for the guns you have. Describe them physically and present the reasoning for them to be considered as curio or relic. You must also present any historical data associated with the gun.After you are done with the collection it is very important that the guns are placed in a safe and secure place. Lock the place where these things are placed to avoid any unwanted incidents. Always go through the state laws for guns. These keep varying and must be tracked from time to time.How to Clean the Gun CollectionCleanliness of guns is very important and must not be ignored. This can be ensured in two ways, first it must be ensured that the guns are in working condition and secondly they must be properly oiled and wiped to avoid any corrosion. Follow these steps to keep your gun collection clean.1. Buy the best cleaning tools for your guns. For the cleanliness of a gun’s bore, you must buy the cleaning rods and bronze bristle brushes.2. Buy the tools which are compatible with your guns. Always have spare toothbrushes and gun oil.3. Lubrication of a gun is very important and you must have lubricants along with guns in your collection. The lubrication protects the gun from salts and other damaging matter.4. Now you must start cleaning each of your gun separately. Start off with the cleaning of the cylinder of a gun with a bristle brush or rod. Look for any faults or malfunctions.5. If you have guns which get dissembled then you must clean each part separately. Use a toothbrush or soft cloth to clean smaller parts nad oil the metal components.6. Now comes the cleaning of the bore. Soak bristle brush in solvent and clean the bore of the gun with it. You may use a cloth attached to the bore if you like. To ensure a well cleaned bore, you must pass the brush many times over the bore.7. Now use dry cloth for further cleanliness. You may observe rust on the cloth while cleaning the cylinder.8. Soak a cloth in dun oil and lubricate the cylinder of the gun. The ideal cloth that you may use would be a woolen cloth however a paper towel may also do the job well.After you are done with the cleaning, place the barrels faced down so that the oil drips away. Do not let the oil go and stay inside the gun. Unloading the gun is very important before you start off cleaning it. It will save you from many unwanted incidents. Always take safety precautions while cleaning a gun. Keep the guns out of the reach of children. Safety of the guns and children alike must be ensured.CONCLUSIONGun collection is a great hobby yet a difficult one too. Men have long been passionate about weapons and armors and so gun collection seems to be the perfect hobby to satiate their love for these things. All a person need is a determined mind and a zealous heart.",
Ham Radio,"Ham Radio Information  Introduction HAM radio operators, also known as amateur radio operators, currently number over two million people around the world. Unlike the name implies amateur radio operators or HAMs are anything but amateur. The term amateur is used only to designate that the hobby, pastime or passion is not intended to be used for generating profit. 

These men and women routinely provide public service, assistance in emergency situations in addition to enjoying getting to know other amateur radio operators over the entire world. They are licensed in their respective country or even internationally to use specific bandwidths and frequencies to communicate worldwide. Each HAM radio operator has a unique call sign that identifies their country, license classification and their specific identification. With new changes in licensing exams more and more people are getting involved in the hobby of HAM radio operation. 

There are several new types of specialized interests for HAM radio operators. Amateur television, amateur satellite communications, severe weather spotting, tracking information, high speed telegraphy, high speed multimedia and even low power operation known as QRP are relatively new additions to the specialized side of the hobby. 

One popular combination of HAM radio operation and sports is a combination of orientation, racing and radio. Amateur radio direction finding (ARDF) or fox hunting is very popular in most of Europe and China. It is governed by the International Amateur Radio Union and includes a timed race with each competitor allowed a map, compass and radio to attempt to detect radio transmitters located along the route. The winner completes the course in the fastest time and also locates all or the most the radio transmitters on the course. 

Within the United States and around the world there are over a hundred different internationally recognized HAM radio clubs and organizations. Countries as small as Belarus and Aruba have their own organization while larger countries such as the United States, Canada, China and the United Kingdom are home to several different clubs. 

Surprisingly the cost of becoming a HAM radio operator is much lower than people imagine. The technology can be highly portable and perfect for communication in remote locations where other forms of communication such as cell phones or internet connections are not feasible or possible. Smaller more compact units and even hand held devices have changed the accessibility of HAM radio for a variety of applications, adding to the number of those that enjoy this fascinating hobby. 
History The history of HAM radio dates back over 200 years to the first studies of electromagnetic waves. It was based the early mathematical work of Michael Faraday and later James Clerk Maxwell that identified the relationship between electricity and magnetism and the understanding of ""fields"" that allowed the transmission of electromagnetic waves over great distances. 

From this early beginning Samuel Morse, inventor of telegraphy and eventually Morse Code, created a way to harness and use this information to provide specific information with those same electromagnetic fields. The first result was a string of numbers on a strip of paper, similar to a ticker tape, with the numbers representing specific words transmitted through a wire. This was horribly tedious and required the operator and receiver to have a dictionary key to translate the string of numbers into language. In 1838 after traveling to Europe and seeing other systems in use, Morse actually developed a standardized series of dots and dashes that represented the same letters and numbers. This standardized the code and allowed it to be used by anyone, anywhere without the need for the cumbersome decoding and encoding manual. 

From Morse code came other codes, designed to shorten the sequence required to transmit and receive information. The Q Code was very popular in marine types of transmissions and was used as the standard form of telegraphy. With the completion of the Atlantic cable in1866 between Europe and the United States, international communication using telegraphy was now possible. Wired telegraphy continue to flourish, but the seeds of wireless communication where also planted. 

By 1887 Heinrich Hertz was able to actually measure the properties of the electromagnetic waves first identified by Maxwell. This then lead to the differentiation between light and radio waves. This information is then used by Guglielmo Marconi to develop a method to transmit information wirelessly using the technology that was over a hundred years in the making. The first wireless signals were sent between England and France in 1899. At the same time Tesla was working on transporting electricity through the air using coils, a technology that would continue to prove its importance. By 1901 the first trans-Atlantic transmission by wireless methods occurred, covering a distance of 2100 miles from Cornwall, England to St. John`s, Newfoundland. Within a few years ships and commercial stations for transmitting wireless messages were soon established internationally. 

Perfecting vacuum tubes, Tesla coils and receivers and transmitters provided opportunities for those interested in electricity and radio to get involved in the field. At first largely unregulated, it was soon recognized that some type of oversight had to be provided as jamming or overriding frequencies was common, preventing information from getting through. Surprisingly it was Australia that actually had the first club, The Wireless Institute of Australia, which was founded in 1910. The following year Great Britain founded its first Amateur Radio club followed by the Amateur Radio Movement, started in the USA in 1912. 

From this point on there was a rapid increase in the number of amateur radio operators. By 1911 it is estimated that there were 10,000 home use HAM radios in operation in the United States. From its early beginnings HAM radio really took off with people enthusiastic about communicating with others locally, nationally and internationally. Before the technology of the internet was available this was one of the only ways that a two way conversation with an unknown person in another country could be done. After all there were no forums, chat rooms or voice chat systems. 
Licensing Ham radio operators with in the United States can choose to be licensed in one of three categories. The most basic is a technician license, followed by a general and extra license. Each successive level provides for more privileges and operating possibilities. In the United States and Canada as well as other countries it is illegal to operate a HAM radio without the proper license. Licensing in one country does not necessarily mean you can operate an amateur radio in another, and verifying required documentation or licensing with the country you are visiting is essential before transmitting or receiving. 
Equipment HAM equipment is not as costly as most of the computer equipment used today. The great news is that belonging to a HAM radio club can allow you to try out a variety of different equipment models and styles and perhaps even purchase used equipment at a fraction of the cost of new. 

In general the basics needed to get started include a HAM radio receiver for HF bands or a transceiver, which is a receiver and a transmitter that will cover the HF, VHF and UHF bands. Remember that the HF receiver will be essential for long distance radio, which is often the reason that people get involved in this hobby. The other bands are great for local and national types of communications. 

The transceiver and receiver units can be portable, fixed or mobile. Fixed models are often known as base stations and are typically located in a quiet area of the home or even in a garage or separate building that allows for privacy when receiving and transmitting messages. In HAM radio talk any place that the radio is located is known as the ""shack"", even if it is located in a room in your home. Portable models allow a lot more options for those that need a high level of mobility with their systems. 

An antenna is essential as well. These are not the small antenna that you use for your television or radio, these are tower style antenna, usually yagi type, which will be able to operate on different bands. A yagi antenna, more correctly known as a Yagi-Uda, is a directional antenna that can have either horizontal or vertically polarized for maximum effectiveness. It looks like three thin parallel metal tubes that are positioned horizontal to the ground on the top of the tower. For most amateur operators the same tower and antenna will be used for both receiving and transmitting but more advanced antenna systems with separate transmitting and receiving antennas are highly recommended once you get established. 

Antenna towers must be properly secured and have the correctly number of guy-wires to prevent accidents and possible injury. Guy-wires are tensioned cable that attach at specific distances along the tower to secure anchors in the ground. These cables prevent the tower from breaking in high wind or severe weather conditions. In cities and residential areas the antenna must also conform to any city ordinances or bylaws with regards to towers and antennas. 

Although many HAM radio operators build their own equipment, which is allowed without the need for government approval or certification provided it is within the amateur spectrum, there are also HAM radio kits. These kits provide you with each piece of the radio which is then assembled following very specific instructions. This option is both education and informative plus it also allows you to tune and customize your radio to suit your own HAM interests and areas of specialization. 

Used HAM equipment may also be a great option, especially receivers, radios and antenna towers. The equipment, if properly protected from the elements and well maintained, has a very long life. Picking up used HAM equipment from a member of the local Amateur Radio Club is a good option to both get help and advice as well as ensure the equipment is in good working condition. A Hamfest, a gathering of HAM radio operators, is also an excellent spot to pick up equipment, tips and education. 
Training Becoming a member of a club will allow you to learn under the tutelage of a licensed and experienced HAM operator. Clubs typically have base stations set up for this type of training, plus as mentioned above this also lets you try out different types of equipment to find which options you want in your own home or HAM radio space. 

Online sites provide practice test questions as well as drill and rehearsal types of exercises. Typically HAM radio communities tend to be very supportive of these getting involved in the hobby and are more than happy to help with training those interested. In addition many clubs host classes that teach specific information that is covered on the exam as well as allow you to interact with highly experienced HAM radio operators that are typically licensed at the highest ""extra"" level. Attending a class is highly recommended for those new to HAM radio as it will explain a lot of the technical issues in simple, straightforward and easy to understand terms. Once you know the basics you can explore your own areas of interest and focus in on different training specializations within the amateur radio spectrum. 
Conclusion While HAM radio is a bit more involved than many other hobbies, it is really an exceptional opportunity to learn about communication technology, provide services and support as well as to meet people with similar interests from all around the world. HAM radio licenses can be an asset in many types of activities and even in some employment categories making this a very rewarding hobby. HAM radio operators also routinely get together for meetings, educational opportunities as well as host competitions to build skills and meet others with the same interests.",
Judo,"Judo Information  Introduction Judo is a Japanese martial art that stresses the development of the practitioner’s mental and physical abilities in equal measure. It teaches that the best course of action is to exert the least amount of force to achieve the maximum result. The second most important element taught is the idea of mutual benefit. 

The philosophy behind mutual benefit is that, nothing can be gained at the expense of others. All parties must work together to prosper. Judo shows that all people have value. This involves a high degree of respect for others, especially the place in which you train and your instructor. 

Like many forms of martial arts, Judo ranks its practitioners with a colored belt system. There are two categories to this ranking structure, the student kyu and the master dan. Dan is reached upon receiving a black belt. From then on, a master can obtain ten further degrees of status. In more traditional setting, only when reaching a fifth degree black belt is a master referred to as a sensei. But no matter what your rank all of the practitioners of Judo are called jūdōka. In the early part of the 20th century, several Judo masters left Japan to spread the art style across the world. By 1964, the popularity of Judo was recognized by adding it as a competitive event in the Olympics for men. It wasn’t until 1992 that a woman’s division was added as well. 

Even to this day the art form is being revised. In 1982, the moves of Judo were revised and updated to fit today’s modern standards. The creations of new moves are also being instituted. 1997 saw the implementation of two new throws recognized by the Judo community. 
Principles of Judo There are five major principles that encompass Judo. These rules both guide the training of the body and the mind. Some of these principles are broken up into more specific concepts. 

In doing this, the sensei may stress subtle but necessary aspects in the lesson. Many of these distinctions are made to show the difference between a mental versus physical approach to the student. 

Seiryoku Zenyo 

Put simply this is the idea of maximum efficiency. It is wasteful to use more force than what is necessary. Nor should you use your own force if it is supplied by someone else. 

For the art itself, this meant that moves that relied solely on force were discarded from the two schools of jujutsu. Moves that remained focused on a wide variety of more defensive type actions. That’s why throws play a major role in Judo. 

If one were to apply this principle to ones life, it may be summarized like this. A bolder is in the middle of the path. The most efficient way to deal with this problem would involve walking around it. 

Mutual Benefit 

The second founding principle had little to do with the martial art and more to do with moral behavior. In this ideology it is believed that no one prospers through selfish acts. Instead everyone must work to help everyone else to gain prosperity. 

This gives guidance to practitioners to tell them when Judo is most appropriate. Will subduing this individual help all the people involved? If the answer is, this will only help me, then this rule guides the person not to use physical force. In situations where only you benefit, Judo may advocate talking through the problem rather than resorting to a physical exchange. 

Sen 

There are three levels to this principle. The first and most straight forward is Sen itself. The rough translation means initiative. Utilizing this aspect of the principle means you will act first in order to disrupt your opponent’s actions. This is also the most basic form of Sen. 

The next form is known as ato no-sen. This teaches the student to react to their opponent’s body language. It is a skill of observation and timing which adds the increased difficulty to learning it. 

The most advanced level of Sen is sen-sen-no-sen. To master this principle one must anticipate and understand the mindset of their opponent. The end result will appear something like mind reading. Where the Judo master acts against their opponent before the opponent even knows what they’re going to do. Lessons that teach this are reserved for the highest levels of Judo. 

Kuzushi 

All combat must come to an end. In Judo the principle that concludes all actions is Kuzushi. This states that to defeat a person, their balance must be broken. Breaking the balance can be achieved in one of two ways. 

The opponent whose balance is compromised can either lose it through their own actions or be made vulnerable by another’s actions. Both of these outcomes can be reached by two different means. 

The first of these styles is kake. This is an aggressive attack action which presses the issue to resolve itself. This compliments the ideas of sen and sen-sen-no-sen extremely well. Your attack comes first thereby disrupting the other person. 

The other method is tsukuri. Tsukuri is often explained as a preparatory attack. Either you prepare yourself, jibon-no-tsukuri, or preparing your opponent, aite-no-tsukuri. To prepare yourself you must stay relaxed and flexible. To prepare others you must throw the person off balance making them vulnerable. This compliments ato-no-sen, as a reactive response. 

Ju-no-ri Ju-no-ri is often referred to as the principle of gentleness. It states that you must remain both flexible and adaptable. Force expended is not as important as how you might direct the force. 

In practice, if an opponent were to push you, you don’t push back. Rather, you pull them, thus creating less effort for yourself and putting you in control of their force. Likewise, if they were to pull you, you can take control of the force by directing your push. 

Ju-no-ri is what ties the other principles together. It provides a transitory phase between initiating and finishing an action, while at the same time reminding the practitioner of their moral responsibilities. 
What you need Like many martial arts , casual clothes are not suitable for practicing the art form of Judo. In Judo a white uniform called a judogi, or simply gi, is used. The uniform involves three parts the top, which closes much like a robe, and pants. Ties and draw strings are used to fasten these pieces securely. The final piece is the belt, which is colored to denote your respective level of the art. 

The uniform is durable while still allowing a full range of movement. It is also important to note that there is a right and wrong way to tie your belt. The outfit itself will range anywhere between $20 to $60 depending on your size and its availability. 

As for a place to learn, the accessibility and price can range dramatically. Some schools provide basic classes on Judo. However, if you are serious about the art you might want to seek out a local martial arts studio that teaches it. 

The price you pay will cover the facility, training, and all the accessories needed to learn. Things like mats and other pads for practicing will be provided. And never underestimate the need for a qualified instructor. 

Mind you, this is not a solo hobby. Given the potentially lethal elements of any martial art, it’s recommended you don’t try teaching yourself. Once you get started in a Dojo, martial arts studio, they will instruct you on ways to practice inside and outside their approved environment. 

To find these places, it’s as simple as using a local phone book, or for the more technically savy, doing a search on your favorite search engine. Many times these facilities will have a special introductory price for beginners. This makes it easier to see whether or not Judo is right for you. 
Taking it Further For some the idea that this is either a self-defense option or a way to live my life is not enough. Many people need a bit more structure and a goal to orientate themselves on. For these people you can look to the more competitive side of Judo. 

These events stress the mastery of the form by allowing those with the desire to test themselves against others for comparison. The environment is made as safe as possible while at the same time supportive. 

Since Judo itself is not structured to be judged and measured, rules were laid out by the world organizations. With these rules and scoring mechanisms, it’s possible to add a robust and competitive edge to this physical pursuit. 
Self-Defense On the other hand, people who choose Judo do so for reasons all their own. The best example of this is self-defense. This has nothing to do with competition. Those who seek this reason may want to feel safer or perhaps it is work related. 

Many armed forces and police officers will utilize Judo training in their work environment. Subduing an individual while trying to maintain that person’s safety is a tall order for many martial artists. In contrast, Judo is designed specifically with this in mind. 

Courses that teach self-defense will more likely favor the idea of Judo over more violent approaches for a number of reasons. If the person defending themselves injures the attacker, the attacker may have legal grounds to seek revenge. Also, serious injury to an attacker may instigate a more violent response by that person. 

Those interested in a more self-defense application of Judo should ask about being trained in a particular Kata form. Some of these forms include Kime No Kata, Joshi Judo Goshinho, and Kodokan Goshin Jutsu. However, it may be better to find a self-defense course that isn’t martial art specific. Many times these classes will have already incorporated the most useful elements in their curriculum. 
Conclusion For those seeking a way to balance their life, Judo makes an excellent option. Having no restriction to joining, it opens itself to nearly any type of person. Young or old, man or woman, even those with disabilities are all welcome. 

Going back to the principles of Judo, it desires to spread the idea of mutual benefit to everyone. As for the physical aspect, it favors skill over size and strength unlike other martial arts. This further reduces any limitations or preconceived worries anyone might have on joining. 

Furthermore, it can promote a healthier life style. By increasing your level of awareness and boosting your initiative, you’ll find you have more confidence in yourself. Coupled with the principle to help others, you’ll find you’ll spread your mood and prosperity to others around you.",
Parkour - Freerunning,"Parkour - Freerunning Information  Definition of Parkour Parkour (also known as PK or free running), is the physical hobby of being able to overcome any obstacle in your path by adapting your movements to the environment. This hobby originated in france and is about moving around objects in the most efficient form possible. 
Movements in Parkour The different Parkour movements are running, jumping, vaulting, climbing, balancing, and quadrupedal movement. 
Making a start in the world of Parkour A lot of different aids and advice have been made available for people who are ready to take their first step in the world of Parkour or free running. A lot of video recordings are available which show people performing many dangerous stunts and jumps. The two main benefits which can be achieved by becoming an avid practitioner of Parkour is that the overall speed and efficiency of the person will undergo a large amount of dramatic improvement. The speed at which a person will travel from one point to the next will change to a large extent. A lot of similarities exist between Parkour and free running. However movements like ‘flips and spins’ which involve a lot of aesthetics will be seen in free running. These moves will be absent in Parkour. There is no specific path which needs to be followed for people involved in free running. There are many people who are actively involved both in Parkour as well as free running. 

Any person who would like to train for Parkour should make sure that he is in a physically fit condition. The person should not be suffering from any kind of health problems during Parkour training. The body of the person should not be maneuvered in any manner which could result in any kind of dangerous consequences for the health of the person or prove to be fatal. This could decrease the rate of improvement of the person during the process of Parkour training. 

There are many different methods which can be adopted in order to undergo the process of training for Parkour. It is always better to adopt the older and more original methods of training in order to achieve the best possible results within a reasonable time period. These methods are less stressful and hence more enjoyable for the person who is undergoing training. The basic methodology involved in this kind of training is when a point in the distance is selected and the trainee should adopt all possible measures in order to reach that point. 

A slow and steady pace should be adopted initially in order to reach the specified point. Different methods and routes should be traced which will help the person to reach the destination. The creation of these routes will help the person to gain a clear and much better understanding of the overall area. Once the overall familiarity regarding the specified area starts increasing, the speed of the person who is undergoing training will also start increasing in a proportional manner. 

As the speed keeps increasing in a slow and steady manner, the level of difficulty for the person will also start decreasing. He will be able to navigate all over the specified area and overcome all the available obstacles within a short period of time. Some people will be able to exhibit a large amount of progress within a few hours or days after they start training for Parkour. But some people will have to undergo training for a few years before they are able to exhibit any signs of progress or improvement. But the rate of progress and improvement in any person will be dependent on many different factors like his individual capacity or capability. Any person who has decided to undergo training for Parkour should ensure that he does not lose heart and give up whenever he has to encounter failure. Every failure should be counted as a stepping stone on the path to success. 

A person who has been undergoing training for Parkour for an extended time period will develop a certain individual style after a certain point in time. This will be the personal style of the person which will be dependent on the unique capabilities and capacity of the body of the person. This will enable them to overcome obstacles and find solutions to all problems in their own unique manner. 

A lot of video clippings which can be found on the YouTube website on the Internet have propagated the notion there are certain specific tricks and moves which can be learnt by all beginners in the world of Parkour. Every person who is either a Parkour practitioner or who is undergoing training for Parkour will develop his own unique style and set of moves which will prove to be useful only for him. These moves will not prove to be useful to any other person who practices Parkour or who is interested in getting trained for Parkour. Hence people who are beginners in the world of Parkour should make sure that they do not rely too much on videos found on the Internet relevant to Parkour. This will also enable them to open up their minds and absorb all the elements of the training which is being provided by the instructor and understand them in the right manner. 

Self exploration is one of the most important tools which will be involved during the process of Parkour training. The process of self exploration takes place when a person gets in touch with his inner self in order to gain a much better understanding of his ability and capacity. This will enable the person to get a better idea of the manner in which his body functions and how he can gain the maximum amount of benefit from his in-built talents. He can customize the training techniques in the required manner so that the process of Parkour training will take place in the right manner. New methods of training for Parkour can also be devised in this manner. 
Parkour training in groups Parkour training can also be conducted by the instructor by dividing all his disciples into small groups. Every group can consist of two to four people and this will also help the instructor in imparting training in the right manner. This will also help the instructor in devising new methods in using which the right kind of training can be given to the students. New styles can also be developed in this manner in order to increase the available opportunities. 

This process of providing Parkour training by dividing people into small groups can prove to be extremely effective in the long run. This will prove to be beneficial to the instructor as well as the students. It will help the students to understand that the same set of techniques and methods cannot be used by every student. Each student in the class will have to develop his own individual techniques and methods in his own special style. But they will also be able to gain a better understanding of the different varieties and styles which can be developed by every individual who is undergoing the process of Parkour training. This will also help them in understanding the need to develop their individual techniques and style. 

There are many instances when the instructor has to impart Parkour training to his students by dividing them into large groups. But this kind of training may not prove to be completely effective for the students. The instructor may not be able to provide the required amount of individual attention for every student and provide the right kind of guidance at specific points. 

When the students have been divided into very large groups, they will not pay special emphasis to every obstacle in front of them and they will concentrate on overcoming all the available obstacles at any given cost without paying any importance to the method being adopted in order to overcome them. Every student who is undergoing Parkour training should definitely undergo the process of self exploration and self discovery in order to unearth his complete ability and potential. Only then it will be possible for the student to gain the maximum amount of benefit from the entire process of Parkour training. 
Finding a Parkour training instructor People who would like to undergo Parkour training should make sure that they get the right kind of instructor their training purposes. The instructor who is imparting the training should be qualified to prevent any kind of accident or injury which is likely to occur during the course of the Parkour training process. At the same time, the person should not completely depend on the knowledge and training which is provided by the instructor. They should try to train themselves to a certain extent. People who decide to completely depend on the training and knowledge provided by an instructor sometimes stand the risk of travelling on the wrong path. 

A person who would like to undergo Parkour training should first conduct a certain amount of preliminary training regarding the subject of Parkour training. This will help them to understand the exact purpose which will have to be fulfilled when they recruit the services of an instructor. They will understand the qualities which they need to look for in a Parkour training instructor. 

The popularity of Parkour training is increasing all over the world. A lot of people are making good use of this increasing popularity and they are advertising their services as a Parkour training instructor. People who do not have a proper understanding of Parkour also identify themselves as instructors with their surface level knowledge. 

A knowledgeable and experienced instructor will ensure that he keeps himself updated about the latest developments in the field by attending outdoor sessions which are made available to people at no extra cost. The right kind of instructor will ensure that the process of training is started off on the right note and he will teach his student all the proper moves which are required for a beginner. 

He should also ensure that the student is made aware of all the required safety tips and measures which will protect him at all times even after the process of Parkour training has been completed. The instructor will also initiate the process of self exploration and self discovery in the student. This will help the student in gaining a complete understanding of his inner self and his capabilities. A person who has realized his full potential will be able to devise his own methods and techniques and create his own individual style in this manner. A fake and fraudulent instructor will try to make the student follow the path which has been outlined by him and he will not encourage any form of originality. 

A lot of people realize that they are following the wrong path long after they have started the process of Parkour training. Such people can decide to find a reliable instructor who will be able to orient them in the right manner so that they will follow the right path during the process of Parkour training. But the basic philosophy behind the process of Parkour training lies in creating a path which leads from one point to the next. This is something which will have to be remembered by all beginners as well as experienced veterans. 
Precautions to be taken during Parkour training People thinking of undergoing Parkour training should be aware of the level of danger which is involved in this kind of sport. They should avoid dangerous places like roof tops and hill tops. The progress made during the process of Parkour training should be slow and steady in order to ensure the right kind of improvement and results. This will also help them in gaining better control of themselves and their body. It will also help them in understanding their limits. 

This form of control will also ensure that they do not endanger themselves or damage their surroundings. They should be aware of the kind of surface which is subject to easy damage and they should make sure that they avoid any such surface during the course of their training. The right kind of outfit and shoes will have to be procured before the process of Parkour training is started. The clothes which are worn during the process of training should be comfortable so that the body of the person is completely flexible. This will also help in achieving the right kind of flow which is a very important part of the process of Parkour training.",
Badminton,"Badminton Information  Introduction Badminton is a highly enjoyable game and a hobby that can help you stay fit. It is among the rare sports that men and women play together. People of all ages can play badminton. However, you need to have a high level of fitness to play professionally. As you progress in your game, playing badminton is also a great way to make new friends at your local club or sports center. 

Badminton is the second most popular sport in the world, after soccer. In South East Asia, children learn to play at school. It is the fastest racket sport with the badminton shuttle’s speed reaching over 200 km per hour. 

In addition to being a fun game, badminton also brings several health benefits, whether you choose to play it as a hobby or on a professional level. Just thirty minutes of play on a regular basis can help you maintain a healthy heart and give you a complete body work out, while helping improve your overall health. It helps strengthen your muscles and keeps you flexible as you move around the badminton court. 

Let us now get a quick idea of badminton, the game and what it involves. 
Laws The size of the badminton court for a game of singles is 44 feet long and 17 feet wide. For a doubles game, it is 44 feet long and 20 feet wide. The net’s height is five feet. While there is no rule for the minimum height of the ceiling, obviously a low ceiling is inconvenient. 

Here is a quick summary of the ten rules of badminton, followed by a detailed description of the regulations related to the equipment used in the game.  
The 10 Rules Of Badminton 1. The game of badminton begins with the toss of a coin and the winner of this toss gets to choose to serve or receive first, and also which side of the court they want to be on. 2. During the play, a player should never touch the net, either with her body or with the racquet. 3. The shuttle must never be carried on or rest on the racquet. 4. At no point should a player reach across the net to hit the shuttle. 5. To be valid, a player’s serve should be diagonally across the court 6. At the time of the serve, the player must not be in contact with the lines on the court, until the player making the serve hits the shuttle. The shuttle must always be hit from below the waist while serving. 7. When a player wins a rally, one point is added to her score. 8. A player wins a rally when she strikes the shuttle and the shuttle hits the floor on the opponent’s side and when the opponent commits a fault. A fault is defined as a player’s failure to hit the shuttle over the net or when the shuttle lands outside the court’s boundary. 9. Each side is allowed to strike the shuttle only once before it goes over the net. After it is hit, the player cannot strike the shuttle in a new shot. 10. If the shuttle hits the ceiling, it is a fault. 

Your first step, when you begin playing badminton is to remember these ten rules. Then follow it up by knowing more about the laws and regulations related to the equipment you will use, namely, the racquet and how it is designed, the shuttle, its shape and weight and so on. 
Equipment Laws The Laws specify which equipment may be used. In particular, the Laws restrict the design and size of racquets and shuttlecocks. The Laws also provide for testing a shuttlecock for the correct speed.  
Racquets Badminton racquets are light, with top quality racquets weighing between 75 and 95 grams (2.6 to 3.3 ounces) including the strings. They are composed of many different materials ranging from carbon fibre composite (graphite reinforced plastic) to solid steel, which may be augmented by a variety of materials. Carbon fiber has an excellent strength to weight ratio, is stiff, and gives excellent kinetic energy transfer. 

Before carbon fiber composite, racquets used to be made of light metals and wood. Nowadays, nanomaterials such as fullerene and carbon nanotubes are added to rackets giving them greater durability. 

There is a wide variety of racquet designs, although the laws limit the racquet size and shape.  
Strings Badminton strings are thin, high performing strings in the range of about 0.62 to 0.73 mm thickness. Thicker strings are more durable, but many players prefer the feel of thinner strings.  
Grip The choice of grip allows a player to increase the thickness of his racquet handle and choose a comfortable surface to hold. A player may build up the handle with one or several grips before applying the final layer. 

Players may choose between varieties of grip materials. The most common choices are PU synthetic grips or toweling grips. Grip choice is a matter of personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the grip or hands, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another grip material or change his grip more frequently. 

There are two main types of grip: replacement grips and over grips. Replacement grips are thicker, and are often used to increase the size of the handle. Over grips are thinner (less than 1 mm), and are often used as the final layer. Many players, however, prefer to use replacement grips as the final layer. Toweling grips are always replacement grips. 

Replacement grips have an adhesive backing, whereas over grips have only a small patch of adhesive at the start of the tape and must be applied under tension; overgrips are more convenient for players who change grips frequently, because they may be removed more rapidly without damaging the underlying material.  
Shuttlecock A shuttlecock (often abbreviated to shuttle and also commonly known as a bird or birdie ) is a high-drag projectile, with an open conical shape: the cone is formed from sixteen overlapping feathers embedded into a rounded cork base. The cork is covered with thin leather or synthetic material. 

Synthetic shuttles are often used by recreational players to reduce their costs as feathered shuttles break easily. These nylon shuttles may be constructed with either natural cork or synthetic foam base, and a plastic skirt. 

Additionally, nylon shuttlecocks come in three varieties, each variety for a different range of temperatures. These three varieties are known as green (slow speed which will give you an extra 40% hang time/shot length), blue (middle speed), and red (fast speed). The colours, and therefore speeds, are indicated by coloured strips fastened around the cork. In colder temperatures, a faster shuttle is used, and in hotter climates, a slower one is chosen.  
Shoes Badminton shoes are lightweight with soles of rubber or similar high-grip, non-making materials. 

Compared to running shoes, badminton shoes have little lateral support. High levels of lateral support are useful for activities where lateral motion is undesirable and unexpected. Badminton, however, requires powerful lateral movements. 

A highly built-up lateral support will not be able to protect the foot in badminton; instead, it will encourage catastrophic collapse at the point where the shoe`s support fails, and the player`s ankles are not ready for the sudden loading, which can cause sprains. For this reason, players should choose badminton shoes rather than general trainers or running shoes, because proper badminton shoes will have a very thin sole, lower a person`s centre of gravity, and therefore result in fewer injuries. 

Players should also ensure that they learn safe and proper footwork, with the knee and foot in alignment on all lunges. This is not only a safety concern, as proper footwork is critical in order to move effectively around the court. 
Getting Started With Playing Badminton - What You Will Need To get started with badminton, you do not need to make a large investment in terms of equipment costs or learning fees. You would need a sturdy pair of shoes with good grip, a racquet, a set of shuttlecocks and space where you can play. Badminton is a game that you can play indoors or outside. For a singles match you need another player and for a doubles game, you would need three more players in addition to you. 

It is good to have good quality equipment; however, it does not mean you need the latest super-racquet. For around $30 to $40, you can get a good racquet from Yonex or Prince. 

You will find two types of shuttles, the plastic and the feather type. Most beginners get started with the plastic shuttle and as they progress in their game. Plastic shuttles are more expensive than the feather but last longer. Feather shuttles fly faster and in some international games, as many as 20-30 feather shuttles can be used. 

When you play, wear clothes that let you stretch and move freely. A pair of comfortable shorts and a t-shirt should be fine. But when you get into competitive games, you will need to wear all white clothing. 

You might want to get a feel of the game before you actually invest in buying your kit. Try borrowing a racquet and shuttle from a playing friend. Add comfortable clothes that let you move freely and a pair of training shoes and you is good to go. 
Learning The Game To learn the game of badminton, it is best to learn the basics from a trainer or coach. Ask around in your neighborhood to find a coach who can teach you. To become proficient at the game, you need to practice diligently. So get together with a group of friends who play the game to get plenty of practice. When you decide that badminton is something you would like to stick with, you can take your game to the next level and join your local badminton or sports club for regular games and practice. 

Although you can learn a lot about badminton over the internet, from books and videos, a good coach can teach you the essentials of the game much faster. You will also feel motivated to continue to practice as you get ahead with the game. You can find a coach by asking your friends who play badminton or find local pros in your area. There are badminton forums online where you can find coaches in your locality. 

You can also check whether any of the top players at your local club are willing to coach. They may also be able to recommend good trainers. Take a lesson or two to see if you are comfortable with them and decide. 
Playing The Game The game of badminton involves serving, offense and defense moves. As you play, you score points over the opposite side’s players, whether it is a singles or doubles match. In a singles match, you have single opponent, while in a doubles match, you and your partner play against two opponents. 

The toss decides who will serve first. The first serve is underhand and served from the court’s right side. Therefore, you will need to position yourself properly to serve. The serve must land diagonally from where you serve so that it lands across the net on the left side of the opponent’s side of the court. 

Once the shuttle is served, the players play by sending the shuttle over the net, with each team getting one hit at a time. Suppose the shuttle lands on the court of the non-serving team, the serving team gets a point. Only the serving team scores a point. In case the shuttle lands on the court of the serving team, the opponents get the next serve. They can score a point by stopping play on the opponent’s side. 

The aim is to do everything possible to return the shuttle to the opposite site of the court. This will mean a point for the serving team, or enabling the opponent to serve, depending on where the shuttle lands. 

The serving team can also score points if the non-serving team plays, sending the shuttle out of bounds on the other side of the net. The game goes on, in sets of rallies to a score of 15. The first player to reach 15 points wins the match. Usually three games are played and the best two games out of the three win the match. 

The current system of scoring by the International Badminton Federation is the Badminton 21 points scoring system. Here, the first team that reaches 21 points will win the game. Each time a rally is won, the winning team gets an additional point. If there is a tie with both teams scoring 20, the side that scores the next two consecutive points wins the game. If the score reaches 29 with no winner, the team that wins the 30th point is declared the winner of the game. The next step is learning about badminton strokes. 
Badminton Hand Signals Just like any other sport, badminton also uses hand signals through which the game supervisors and players communicate, keep track of scores and also regulate the game. Hand signals are useful because they are convenient for communication during the game, when the player must primarily focus on playing. Since players may be multi-national, hand signals convey simple messages in place of an accent or language that they might find difficult to decipher. 

In badminton, there is a referee who is in charge of the game, an umpire, a service judge and a line judge. These are the people who use hand signals.  
Umpires Umpires use these hand signals: 

Raising right hand straight above head This hand signal is used with the words “(player’s name), warning for misconduct” when the rule 16.8 is reported about the player, or when the umpire observes it.  
Service judges The services judges keep track of whether the player makes the correct serves as per the rules. Services judges use these hand signals: 

Raising the right arm in front just a little, bending the elbow and keeping the palm vertical, facing the opposite direction This communicates that the shaft of the racquet was not below wrist level of the hand holding the racquet, or the racquet’s shaft was not facing towards the floor when the shuttle was hit while serving. 

Keeping the palm facing horizontally downwards at the abdominal level and then moving it to the left and right below the waist level This shows that the shuttle was not below waist level while serving, when it was struck. 

Pointing with the hand to the right foot, with the right leg extended outward. This shows that one or both feet were not in the service court until the serve was completed. 

The palm of the right hand resting on the right side of the abdomen, with the palm facing the body’s left side and the fingers pointing downward; the fingers of the left hand pointing to the right hand’s palm and the palm of the left hand facing the abdomen This indicates that the player did not make the first contact with the shuttle.  
Line judges Line judges use the following hand signals: 

Both hands extend horizontally to the sides of the body This shows that the shuttle landed outside the court 

Hand pointing to the line This indicates that the shuttle landed inside properly 

Closing both eyes with the hands This shows the umpire that they are not sure where the shuttle landed. 

These are the common hand signals used. 

Badminton has governing bodies that regulate the game. Here’s a look at these bodies. 
Tips to Improve your Game Obviously, for any sport, dedication and practice are a must. With the right guidance from a good coach, you need to put in rigorous work on the court to improve your techniques and get better at the game. Here are some tips that can help you get ahead: 

Grip: This is the first thing you must master. Your grip is the way you hold your racquet. If you don’t hold your racquet properly, your strokes will not have the necessary power and you will be at a disadvantage. You will therefore need to ensure that you get the forehand grip and backhand grip right as these are two major badminton strokes. 

Footwork: Footwork is an essential skill if you intend to play badminton really well. Practicing your footwork will enable you capture various shots in a balanced way, as you dodge your opponent. Practice jumping, skipping, bouncing, shuffling, gliding and lunging as these are primary movements on the court. Learn to adjust your base position to match the strengths and weaknesses of the other player. 

Serving: Your serve is one of your most important strokes in badminton. You have to time it well and make it effective as it can determine the course of the game. Therefore, practice the different kinds of serves like high serve, flick serve low serve and drive serve. The way you serve will make a huge difference to your game. 

Clears: This is a crucial badminton stroke that you can play overhead or underarm with a forehand or backhand side. When you practice these, you can improve you game in a big way. 

Drop shots: When you play badminton, your drop shots must be timed and positioned perfectly to give you the advantage. You can play drop shots on the backhand and the forehand sides. With a drop shot, you can make your opponent move to the front of the court, leaving the mid and back court free. Drop shots can be slow or fast. 

Smash: Your smash is perhaps your most lethal weapon on the badminton court. Your best smash is when you direct it in a downward direction forcefully, with the appropriate power, angle and speed, making it tough for your opponent to counter. 

Drives: Your drives, which are those shots that cross over the net flatly, are attacking shots you can use when the shuttle is too low to use a smash. You can play a drive diagonally across the court or straight down. They are more common in a doubles game where the shuttle’s height needs to be low. 

Net play: You need to practice constantly at the delicate net shots. Practice with your racquet to become expert at the net shot, net kill and net lifts. When you are proficient at these, you can easily confuse your opponent. 

Work with your coach to practice in the above with the right techniques. Watching professional players can also help improve your game. Above all, it is practice that gets you there. 
Conclusion Once you decide you want to take up badminton as a hobby, you will enjoy the benefits of becoming fit and healthy. Make sure you get your gear in place and know the rules before you jump right in. Badminton is a high energy sport, and when you decide to play competitively, you will need to ensure that you are in great shape, physically. Nothing can substitute hard work and passion when it comes to a sport, and when you are ready to put in both, you have a great game to enjoy.",
Swimming,"Swimming Information  Introduction Swimming is considered to be healthy forms of exercise, a great way to get fit, and can be enjoyed by all the family. It is an ideal activity for anyone of any age, from young babies to older adults – a lifetime, and you can start at any age. 

Because it is a low impact exercise, the strain on joints, muscles and your back are very much reduced, and it is also good for your circulation, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Swimming tones the body, strengthens the muscles, improves stamina and balance, relieves stress and tension, and is also a great way to burn the fat! It is recommended for people recovering from certain surgical procedures as it helps to build the muscles (always consult your physician prior to starting an exercise programme). Research has shown that pregnant women particularly benefit from swimming, strengthening the abdominal and back muscles. 

The styles of swimming are easy to master and, if you don’t have your own pool or a neighbour’s to use, there are many local public swimming pools that also run classes so that you can learn to swim, from beginners to more advanced, competitive swimming, diving, synchronised swimming, and many other swimming-related activities. 
Benefits of Swimming Swimming benefits the whole body, as well as your mind, spirit and energy levels. The health benefits alone are a very good reason to take up swimming. It is a good cardiovascular activity by increasing your heart rate, helps to build your heart muscles and lung capacity, as well as improving stamina and relieving stress. The water around acts as a support system and thereby causes less strain to your joints and muscles, and you are less likely to suffer the sorts of injuries incurred in other higher impact activities. 

It is a relaxing activity, low impact and boosts energy levels, leaving you feeling refreshed and happy. A lot of sports men and women have found that swimming helps them to build self-discipline, time management and an increased feeling of self-worth. 

Swimming regularly is also a great way to burn fat (or calories) and tone your body as it offers an element of aerobic activity. Swimming burns approximately 3 calories a mile per pound of bodyweight. So, if you weigh 150lbs and it takes you 30 minutes to swim a mile, you will burn about 900 calories in one hour. However, to achieve this you need to be swimming regularly and to be fit. 

Swimming is also beneficial for pregnant women, building abdominal and back muscles, as well as people recovering from certain surgical procedures (always seek the advise of your physician). 
Equipment As long as you have a swimming costume or bikini (for the children and ladies) or swimming trunks/shorts (for the boys and men), then you can go swimming. But there is a lot more equipment you can buy to help make learning easier, and improve your level of swimming competence. There is also equipment you can get if you are planning to take up a swimming-related activity, i.e. diving, snorkelling or synchronised swimming. 

Goggles are very useful if you swimming underwater, particularly for children as it protects the eyes from chlorine in swimming pools. For children that are learning to swim, there are a range of kickboards (held out in front of them to aid buoyancy), arm bands and swing rings, and for babies that are just starting to be introduced to swimming and a few months older, you can get floatsuits which are all-in-one suits with ‘floats’ attached around the body part to aid buoyancy. For the more advanced swimmer, there are fins, hand paddles and swimming gloves (good for resistance training), caps (which are also good for protecting your hair against the chlorine in pools), nose clips and ear plugs. 

Equipment and clothing for swimming activities can be bought from any sports shop, online or through the swimming centre you are visiting. Prices vary depending on the equipment/clothing. 
Where to Learn There are artificially-built swimming pools found in most large towns and cities. Most of them will provide swimming sessions (usually an hour to two hours at a time) according to age and ability groups, i.e. childrens session, parent and child sessions, adult sessions, school club sessions, swimming club sessions, competitive training sessions, etc. 

In addition, most public swimming pools will also run a range of courses for you to learn how to swim, taught by qualified teachers and professionals, from babies and children, to adults. These can either be private one-to-one lessons, a group lesson, or activity classes. Or you may want to join a swimming class, i.e. Aqua-Aerobics, Water Polo, Parent & Child and Pregnant Mums, where you can benefit from not only the exercise but also the social aspect too! 

Many schools run their own swim clubs, where the children are taken to the local swimming centre (if they don’t have their own swimming pool) to develop their skills or learn how to swim. These are usually group lessons and activities. 

You can also become a member, either as an individual or as a family, of a swimming centre and, again, there may be specific member sessions. A lot of swimming centres have several pools, one for beginners and parents with small children, a training pool with ‘lanes’, and an activity pool with slides and other fun equipment – brilliant for the young, confident swimmer. 

Swimming centres will charge a fee to go and swim, and if you are having a lesson or taking part in a class, i.e. Aqua-Aerobics, there may be an additional charge. However, if you take out a membership contract with the centre, these classes are usually discounted and you don’t have to pay each time you visit the centre. 

There are open air pools (‘lidos’) which are open to the public throughout the summer months, where you can swim and relax either individually, with friends or with the family, enjoy a picnic, take a dip and have fun! 

If you go to a ‘lido’, many are free of charge or they request a nominal donation, as these are principally maintained by the council/government. 

And there is, of course, the sea which is free of charge. Many families go to the beach and swimming in the sea is a great open water activity. If you live by the sea, an early morning swim can be very refreshing and boost your energy levels. However, be prepared and watch for strong currents as they can catch you unaware. If children are swimming in the sea, keep an eye on them at all times, make sure the younger children are wearing arm bands or a lifebelt. 
Frequently Asked Questions Q: Do I need to be physically strong and fit? 

A: No. Swimming is a great cardiovascular activity that builds strength and fitness.

A: Yes, but do get instruction from a qualified teacher which will help you master the basics much more quickly.",
Blues,"Blues Information  Intro Closely connected with jazz, blues music is America’s very own music form with its roots in the South, in the fields where the West African slaves worked. They developed a kind of singing that had the form of a call and response that was rhythmic and subsequently formed the foundation for all the blues music that came later. Back when the Civil War ended, the black man had just two choices – either work hard in the fields or become a traveling minstrel. Traveling minstrels sang blues songs with soulful lyrics that described their lives and was based on themes like love, labor, poverty, jail, drinking, sex and whatever they knew. 

Today, there are different types of blues music and a number of legendary artists who make unforgettable music. In fact, blues music has been integrated into various genres of music successfully, producing memorable sounds that appeal to music fans across the world. 

Let’s take a deeper look at blues history – it is very interesting. 
History Of The Blues The blues is called so as it is likened to a cry of hurt, and a cry for freedom. This simple music form has a plethora of emotions and its structure revolves around three chords making it a common expression of pain. There is no specific information about when the blues started, but what we do know is that it originated in the Mississippi Delta where the field workers sang at work and from gospel music around the end of the 19th century. W C Handy is called the Father of Blues music, but not because he was the first one to sing blues music but because his music was the first ever blues music to be published. He first heard blues music as he waited at Tutwiler, a country railway station when a fellow traveler played the guitar, using his knife as a slide and sang, “Goin’ where the Southern cross the Dog.” He was so impressed that he used it in the pieces he composed. Blues can be played with three notes and chords, the first, fourth and fifth in the scale played in an eight or 12-bar cycle. Mastering it is another story.

1920 - 1930 Close to the 1930s, the blues gradually grew into an art form with amazing guitarists. The harmonica became the most preferred accompanying instrument since it was cheap, could be carried around easily and had the ability to play a variety of sounds. Artist Sonny Boy Williamson practically made it sound like an orchestra. Robert Johnson acknowledged as the greatest blues music artist of all time became popular during this period. Although there are not many recordings of his work, from what is available, it is obvious that he played with a passion, surpassing everyone else. 

Country blues saw its rise in the 1920s when the 78-rpm record was popular and record labels like Paramount, Aristocrat etc., began recording the most popular blues artists of the time. 

The nightclubs in Chicago heard the blues for the first time when blacks migrated there, during the Great Depression. The pianists from New Orleans who played in honky tonks, closely followed by the Fast Western pianists and county singers joined these folk singers. The combined style now spread to Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland and New York where classic blues musicians, together with these folk blues musicians took their music to clubs, theaters and dance halls. Blues now sounded more professional, with a refined and definite form. 

The classic blues style became popular basically because of female singers who evolved from singing in churches and within the community to perform in theaters, clubs, dance halls, vaudeville shows. It was in 1920 that Mamie Smith’s Crazy Blues sold 75,000 copies in its first month of release and encouraged more classic blues singers to come forward. During the 1920s and 1930s the market was among the blacks. The records were even called race records, with recording companies advertising to the blacks and only black stores selling the records. 

Around 1929 during the Depression in the US, life became hard for the blues musicians. Record sales dipped and the popularity of blues music declined.

1940 – 1960 Around 1941, the famous Alan Lomax recorded blues musicians live, and it is this that made blues popular with the white Americans. There was a slight decline during the 1950s. Then the Kingston Trio’s hit Tom Dooley brought back blues music to the people and gradually, rock bands integrated the blues into their music during the 60’s and 70’s. Some prime examples are the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, John Mayall, etc. In fact, in the 1960s, the earliest recordings from the original blues men was discovered by white musicians in the US and England, helping revive it again. 

Legendary artists like Muddy Waters and Howlin Wolf added electric guitars and drums to be heard in larger crowds. 

Today blues music has a strong influence over other genres of music like rock, rhythm and blues, rap, etc. 
Types Of Blues Music Blues music can be broadly categorized into four types. They are: • Delta blues • Chicago blues • Texas blues • Blues rock  
Delta Blues Said to be the original blues, this was played by the black people in the Mississippi delta region. They rarely used the harmonica and piano. The distinctive feature of this music was the 12-bar arrangement and the vocal repetition in the call and response style. Popular Delta blues artists are Muddy Waters, Charlie Patton, Eddie J ‘Son’ House, Robert Johnson, etc.  
Chicago Blues When the Delta blues musician migrated to Chicago they used the electric guitar to accompany their blues music giving rise to the urbanized Chicago blues. Voice amplification via microphones, bass and drum sets, horns and of course, electric guitars typified the Chicago Blues. Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and Howlin’ Wolf are good representatives of the Chicago Blues.  
Texas Blues Texas Blues is similar to the Chicago Blues and popular musicians were T-Bone Walker and Lightnin’ Hopkins.  
Blues Rock Blues rock saw its origins in the early 1960s and it had its influence from the Delta and Chicago blues. Popular with the younger white musicians who imitated the lyrical style and passion of the early blues players, blues rock reveled in volume and beat. Examples are the ZZ Top, The Rolling Stones, the Doors, and Credence Clearwater Revival. The Modern Blues seems different from the original African American way of expression, but there are many artists that keep the original sounds alive through their music. The Fat Possum record label is famous for releasing Mississippi hill country sounds. Buddy Guy is popular for his Chicago blues sounds. Then there are artists like Corey Harris, Guy Davis, and Otis Taylor. Stevie Ray Vaughn is considered the god of guitar. Bonnie Raitt is one of the most acclaimed blues artists with her raspy voice, especially acknowledged for her slide playing. Rory Block has mastered the acoustic sound. Let us look at some of the legendary blues artists that have made blues music what it is today.

Tango,"Tango Information  Intro Tango is a lovely hobby and it is not surprising to find many people drawn to it. Tango is a dance form that involves the expression of feelings and you will see the dancers apparently gliding smoothly, in perfect sync with each other, performing complicated movements in time to the music. You too can enjoy Tango as a hobby. Here’s basic information about the types of tango, the types of music in tango, learning the tango and so on. 
The Origins Of Tango It is interesting to know that the Tango goes back as far as the 17th century to England. From England, it became the Contrdanse in France around 1700 from where it traveled to Spain as the Contradanza around 1750, to become the Danza in Cuba a quarter of a century later. This came to be known as the Habaner. The Tango as we know it today, evolved around 1910. From Cuba to Argentina seemed a natural route where it integrated with a variety of music and dance types, coloring it with Italian, Russian, Spanish, African and Polish forms. Around the 1940s the Tango took America and the rest of the world by storm. 
Basics Of Tango Tango is referred to as the ‘Dance of Love’. It is a Latin American Ballroom Dance that finds its origins in Argentina. Over time, Tango has evolved into different styles the world over. The concept basically is of two lovers being expressive with each other in different moods. One partner initiates movement with the heel of the foot. You will notice that eye contact is important in Tango. 

Tango is danced in five beats, even though the rhythm is eight beats. Some beats are more stressed than others. The last beat could be a movement from the left to right or vice versa, or just a firm stomp. 
Here Is A Very Quick Lesson For You: As we mentioned earlier, you will take 5 steps in 8 beats. These are two beat measures in 4/4 time. Let us now put on a tango record or CD. Let your timing be Slow, Slow, Quick, Quick, Slow – that’s five beats. If you listen carefully, you will know where to start your lead step or the first slow step, usually done by the man. The woman’s step begins with her right foot brought backward, the opposite of the man’s step. So here you go – a slow left foot forward, a slow right foot forward, a quick left foot forward and a quick right foot forward, and then the left toe closes to right foot lightly, slowly. 

That, in a nutshell is how you do the tango. 

No drums are involved in tango music. Instead, you will find violins, piano, and the bandoneons. Bandoneons are German instruments that produce an accordion like sound. 
Styles Of Tango As far as styles of tango go, we will hear of these: 

• Argentine Tango • American Style Tango • International Style Tango 

Each have their own rules followed quite stringently at competitions. 

Let us have a brief look at each style:  
Argentine Tango This has its beginnings in the West Indies and was confined to the ‘lower’ classes. ‘Tango’ comes from the African ‘Tanganya’. The Argnetine tango, also called the Arrabalero originates from the Gauchos of Buenos Aires where it was first danced. Argentine Tango has many variations called the Salon, Club, Fantasio, Nuevo, Club, Milonguero, and so on.  
American Tango American tango is performed at 32 measures per minute and 128-136 beats per minute in the 4/4 time. This style is structured to music and can be danced in the open as well as closed position.  
International Tango This is stricter and more disciplined, danced in the conventional closed positions and is the style you will see at the dance competitions and events. 

There are also variations in tango like French Apache, which is danced to tango music and shows the tango dancers enacting a lovers tiff or passion. You will see the man fling the woman across the floor, while she crawls back, gracefully like a cat, to be embraced by him. This is not considered real tango since the steps are different from tango. The great Rudolf Valentino, an apache dancer, often danced the French Apache. 
Tango Music Carlos Gardel, a highly regarded tango singer in Argentina, is considered among the most well known and has been called the Voice of Tango. Different music styles in tango are the classic or conventional tango, the tango Nuevo that is a more recent form with difference in pace, instruments played, the Vals tango similar to waltzes, and the Milonga or the polka type tango which involves a faster beat and quicker steps. 
Learning the Tango Tango dance clubs and dance studios are the best places to learn the tango. You will also find plenty of private dance studios. Many colleges and universities have a Ballroom Dance Club where you can get classes if you are a student. A quick look through the yellow pages of your area or a search online will show you dance studios in your locality that you can contact. 
Getting The Right Instructor To Progress In Tango So how do you actually get ahead in tango? It is best to stick with one teacher and one style. Private lessons are advantageous because you get one on one attention. Group classes tend to minimize the contact with the teacher. It is important to find a tango instructor who understands what you want and is adequately qualified to teach it to you. Skilled tango dancers do not always make good teachers. You want to know for how long they have been teaching tango, the style they teach and who their tutor was. It is a good idea to experience a couple of classes before you decide to settle for the teacher. At the same time, moving from teacher to teacher can be confusing. 
Progressing In Tango When you learn the tango, do not judge your progress by the complex steps you learn. In tango, there are a specific number of basic movements, which are repetitive in variation. These must be mastered first. Just train your body to perform these movements and the variations will come easily through practice. The best way to progress in tango is to get private lessons in a particular style and then participate in ‘milongas’ where you can dance socially. This way you get the best of both worlds – the social interaction with expert dancers and private attention. This also builds your self-confidence and helps you build your own unique style. The best way to learn tango is in stages and practice regularly. After all, the idea is to have a lot of fun as you learn a dance form. 

This information is only aimed at encouraging you to get started. You can find more information, useful tips at Discover A Hobby. There are also excellent instructional videos that will actually show you how to tango, featuring professional and stage dancers. Check out the great books listed that give you in depth information about Tango. In addition to these, there are many valuable links so that you can learn all you want about Tango. So go ahead, take the step and glide forward in your hobby.",
Sandboarding,"Sandboarding Information  Introduction In many regions of the world, there are no climates that suit a sport like snow boarding. However, these places often have desert or coastal sand regions that can serve in a similar manner. 

In many respects the sports of snow boarding and sand boarding share many characteristics. From the tricks to techniques, the two are nearly identical. Upon closer inspection, there are some fundamental differences which will be discussed in a later section. 

Many people who enjoy one of these two sports will often find enjoyment for the other. Since many principles are shared there are very few things that need to be learned to transition a person from one to the other. 

Sand boarding itself consists of a person riding a board down an inclined surface of sand. These naturally form as dunes in nature. The board can have bindings or not. However, boards without bindings are much more dangerous and aren’t recommended for beginners. 
Differences Between Snow and Sand Boarding The most obvious difference between these two sports is the environment they are practiced in. Snow boarding involves places of high altitude where snow can form. These places are much harder to find than sand. 

Sand boarding is practiced in either a desert region or a beach. The main requirement is that there are dunes which should have a very fine sand consistency. 

The next major difference involves ascending your slope. For many snow boarders they simply get on a lift and ride to the top of their slope. This is possible since the snow collects on a solid surface like a mountain. This allows the construction of a stationary mechanism like a lift to be built. 

Sand dunes on the other hand, do not collect on solid surfaces. Instead they are formed in mounds that only consist of sand. For this reason sand dunes are constantly shifting with the wind. This makes the construction of a lift impossible since the crest of any dune can be in constant flux. 

This is one of the major draw backs to sand boarding. Many people don’t look forward to climbing back up a dune every time they want to ride down. You can use dune buggies to aid in getting up a hill, but this means that one person should remain as a driver. If there is no designated driver, you’ll eventually have to climb the hill to retrieve your dune buggy. 

Another major difference to consider is the material you’re boarding on. You can use a snow board to sand board. The only problem is you’ll most likely ruin your board in the process. Just by examining snow and sand it’s easy to see why. 

Snow is made up of ice particles. When boarding over this surface friction may melt a very small portion of the ice returning it to its liquid form. Also, snow is not a dense material so will separate fairly easy. These two factors make a relatively easy surface to glide along. 

Sand on the other hand is compromised of small fragments of rock whose edges have been worn away. This makes separating the material very easy, but friction can prove to be a bigger issue. Without specially treated boards the constant grinding of sand against any surface will work to erode your board. Currently, there are boards being designed with sand specifically in mind. Only time will improve this technology. 

Another major difference is the equipment used in the two sports. Safety is a major concern in both forms of boarding. Helmets and goggles are excellent pieces of gear to start out with. However, sand boarding will put a greater emphasis on additional pads. A sand based surface will cause much more damage than snow. Make sure you’re fairly covered up, but still comfortable temperature wise. 

Remaining comfortable with the temperature is key. If you over heat you could cause all manner of heat exhaustion and dehydration type ailments. 

Snow on the other hand worries a little less about padding and a greater emphasis on temperature. Hypothermia and frost bite are serious conditions that winter sports are constantly vigilant against. Snow makes a fairly decent cushion for trips and spills. In many ways the snow itself works as padding for your body. What is harder is keeping your body from being exposed. 

The real danger comes when we are all bundled up and begin the activity. After a while our body gets hot because of what we are doing. We then have an urge to remove pieces of our protective coverings and expose our bodies to the elements. This rapid change in heat can have all manner of adverse reactions to your body. 

Another major concern with sand boarding is storms or inhalation of debris. Sand covered regions are often places that have strong winds. If you are not native to the area you may not recognize the strong wind as a storm. 

No matter what sport you do, storms typically don’t mix well. There are certain sports that will have people argue against this, but those people are typically extremists. For example there are some surfers who will try riding waves generated by small hurricanes. 

For sand boarding keep an eye out for severe decreases in visibility and/or breathing problems. This means you might have to stop. If you are caught in a storm and can’t leave, don’t try. Instead cover up as best you can and wait out the storm. You may only prove to increase your problems if you decide to attempt leaving when there is no visibility. 
Basic Techniques Since the safer method is to use a board with bindings this article will only give advice on this type. 

A sand board will have two bindings. You can decide before you begin which foot will be in the lead. The best advice in choosing this is to take a ball, like a soccer ball, and drop it in front of you. Whichever foot you feel naturally inclined to kick the ball with first should be the lead foot. 

For sand boarders only strap the binding on after you reach the top of the dune. Once this is accomplished you can now skate on your board. Use your free foot to push yourself around much like a skate board. You can either pull yourself along from the front or push yourself from the back. 

To orientate yourself on the board you should look at the directions of the board. The front tip of the board is referred to as the nose. The back edge of the board is the tail. The side that you primarily face is your toe side. The side that is primarily behind you is the heel side. 

Once you have a feel for how the board responds, you can get in position for traveling down a slope. It’s recommended to starts on some small dunes. Remember, you are going to have to walk up them again. When you’re starting out you’ll want a lot of practice. A smaller slope will not only give you a less dangerous incline, but you won’t get as tired climbing up it time after time. 

Once you’re in position strap your other foot into the binding. From here it is good to get a feel for your balance and form. 

When riding a board you should always keep your body centered over the board. An equal distribution of weight prevents you from falling over in one direction or another. It also is needed when making turns. Any time pressure is shifted your board will turn in that direction. 

The proper form for riding a board is to have your knees bent and your back and head straight up. Your hands and arms can help in maintaining your balance, but don’t rely too heavily on them since they could just as easily topple you over if you over compensate. 

When maneuvering a sand board the majority of the direction you give will come from your ankles. Depending on how you want to move, your ankles will regulate the pressure of your body weight. The resulting pressure will result in a movement in that direction, thus creating directed movement. 

For beginners three basic maneuvers are typically taught first. These moves are the fall down, the J curve and the s curve. Each of these is forms of turning which will control your decent down a slope. 

The fall down requires you to face the bottom of the slope. Your back should face the top of the slope. Essentially you will work your way side to side slowly progressing down the slope. To do this, make sure that much of the pressure you exert is on your heels. This way you are less likely to tumble head first. Now, with knees still bent transfer pressure to one foot. This should move the board in that direction. You can then reverse direction by putting pressure on the opposite foot. 

This will move your board from nose to tail gradually. This is perfect when you are facing a slope that is too steep for you to get down safely from. This is a great maneuver for beginners. 

The J curve comes in two types. You can either go toe side or heel side in a J curve. To execute this move, point your board down the dune. As you feel the board move you can then give pressure to the board. For a toe side J curve, put pressure on your lead toe followed by your back toe. For a heel side repeat the process by putting pressure on your front heel then your back heel. This will turn the board forming a J shape. 

The last turn is the S curve. To execute this maneuver you must combine the two styles of J curves in a fluid transition. This back and forth motion allows you to control your decent down a dune safely. If you fail to practice this and just point the nose of your board down, the result will be increased speed. 

This increase in speed is advised only for more advanced sand boarders. Many beginners may panic when reaching high speed. Their frantic actions could then result in harm to themselves and others. 
What You Need The main requirement for sand boarding is a place to practice the sport. Some desert regions aren’t suitable. Therefore, you should scout your location carefully. 

Next, make sure your board is designed for sand boarding. If you aren’t sure ask the sales representative at a sporting store for advice. If you fail to get a sand board you can make your own. There are a number of websites that can instruct you in this. If you do use a snow board just prepare yourself for it to get ruined. 

Padding and a helmet are essential safety equipment that everyone should use. You may think they look funny, but when someone gets hurt, it’s the person with the pads and protective gear that is more likely to get up and continue on. 

Goggles aren’t a requirement, but can serve to be very useful. No one likes sand in their eyes. This especially true when you need to see where you are going. Sand may break you fall, but it may also have things buried in it like rocks. These rocks won’t prove to be a problem for those who can see it. 

Finally, make sure you have transportation that is suitable for a sandy environment. Many vehicles can run in tough conditions, but even the most powerful of these vehicles can get fouled up by sand. It gets everywhere including mechanical parts of cars. That’s why you should be prepared with machines like a dune buggy which is designed to travel in these conditions. 
Conclusion Sand boarding can be a fun and exciting sport. This is especially true when things like snow boarding and surfing aren’t options. Just keep in mind that this sport is fairly new and many of the safety issues may still be needed to address. 

At any rate, it gives you another option in your outdoor activities. Like many sports in the same genre keep safety as a priority. As long as you do that you should have a wonderful time.",
Action Figures,"Introduction to Action Figures..Do you remember the epic battles you won and the wild adventures you took with your first G.I. Joe? Does the memory of your Ninja Turtle collection bring a smile to your face? If so, action figures might be right for you. An action figure collection lets you relive those childhood memories every time you open your display case or add a new action figure.Not are action figures fun and rewarding, they are a great investment. Many action figures are valuable collectors items. A properly maintained, mint condition collection full of rare action figures can easily sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Keep in mind that your new collection will probably be worth a few hundred dollars at best. A valuable action figure collection takes years of research, collecting, and maintenance to build.Your collection might focus on a favorite movie, book, comic, television show, or cartoon. Don`t collect something because of its value. Your action figure collection is an opportunity for you to celebrate a theme that is important to you. The more pleasure you take in finding each addition, the better your collection.Keep an eye out wherever you go. Who knows what you will find tucked away in a dusty box in a dark corner. Not every action figure is for everyone. If another collector beats you to a store, don`t be discouraged. A Superman fanatic might pass right over that vintage pre-oil crisis Action Man you`ve been dreaming about for years.What Is An Action Figure?The introduction of G.I. Joe to the toy market resulted in the term “action figures” rather than attempting to market dolls for boys. It is important, then, that an action figure is not confused with a figurine or a doll. While there is some overlap between all three, each category has specific characteristics that are not present in either of the other types of figures.Action figures are defined by the following characteristics:- A minimum of 3 posable points. Moveable arms, legs, knees, feet, hands, necks, and waists are all considered posable parts.
- No less than 3” and no more than 11” tall.
- Accessories are plastic with attached cloth or plastic clothing. The action figure cannot be fully undressed.
Action figures stand out from the crowd through their action and accessory innovations as well as their ability to move. They are particularly suited to collectors as action figures are typically part of a themed series.History Of Action FiguresIn a short fifty years, action figures have come a long way. In the mid-sixties, action figures were just military-themed toys. As time passed, action figures evolved to include millions of extremely popular, innovative toys. Action figures today are almost as popular with the adult collector market as they are with the under-12 market.The well-developed themes and associated accessories of action figures attract more retail attention every year. Name an action movie or a comic book and you will no doubt find an action figure or two designed just for fans. Action figures are so popular that one of America`s top grossing movies of all time, Transformers, was based on the Transformer action figures.",https://www.discoverahobby.com/action-figures#
Languages,"Languages Information Introduction One of the most fantastic aspects of our modern world is that there are hundreds of different languages being used on a day to day basis, and even more impressive than that, most people in this world only know one language. So for whatever reason, our world has been created in a way that created invisible barriers between people based on nothing more than what we take for granted every day, the spoken word. Although it keeps us apart at the best of times, it is amazing that our world is over flowing with different cultures and races that all share their own individual ideas, beliefs, and religions, which adds a rich beauty that surrounds our world. In a lot of ways, the hobby of learning languages is a lot more than a simple hobby to kill time. To learn a new language is a relatively simple way of sharing a piece of culture, or even humanity, between two people that could not have communicated otherwise. Sure its easy to say, “Why don’t they learn English?”, but the fact is that they are saying the exact same thing about you and me. Without being proactive in this world, we lose the ability to connect ourselves with people on the other side of the world from us. 

The thought of learning a new language is perhaps the most daunting task for anyone to undertake because it is literally incomprehensible. For twenty seven year, I have been speaking English as my primary language, and to start looking at different languages is such a step outside of the box that it challenges you to be something more than just yourself. As a Canadian, I am quite luck because since I began elementary school, I have been forced to participate in courses in the French language because Canada is a bilingual country (IE English and French are the native languages of Canada). Although I hated it growing up, it did open the door for me to be interested in different languages and the interest in wanted to dedicate the time to learn a new language. The absolute fact about learning a new language is that it is very easy because we are social creatures, but the hard part to learning a new language is the dedication and perseverance behind learning a language. With strong dedication and the will to push through the learning curve, it is quite easy to learn a new language. 
Why Learn a New Language? Every year, there are thousands of people trying to learn new languages for every reason under the sun. The truth behind learning a new language is that it is both fascinating and fun to do. Most people choose to learn a new language because they are looking for a way to add something to their lives, and on the other hand, some people choose to learn a new language for reason as simple as work placement or emigration. One very common reason behind learning a language is because your partner, in-laws, relatives, or friends speak a different language. By learning to speak that new language, you will help to communicate with them on a much higher level. It will also give you a better understanding of their culture and way of thinking. 

Sometimes your position at work involves regular contact with speakers of foreign languages, and being able to talk to them in their own languages will help you to communicate with them more effectively, plus it garners much respect. This may also help you to make sales and to negotiate and secure contracts. Knowledge of foreign languages may also increase your chances of finding a new job, getting a promotion or a transfer overseas, or of going on foreign business trips. Many English-speaking business people don`t bother to learn other languages because they believe that most of the people they do business with in foreign countries can speak English, and if they don`t speak English, interpreters can be used. The lack of foreign language knowledge puts the English speakers at a disadvantage especially in meetings, for example, when the people on the other side can discuss things amongst themselves in their own language without the English speakers understanding, plus using interpreters slows everything down. This is one of the main reason that Chinese and Japanese are growing in popularity amongst business men because of the amount that these markets import and export to North America. 

During higher levels of research, typically post-graduate work at universities, you may find that information about subjects you`re interested in is published mainly in a foreign language. Learning that language will give you access to the material and enable you to communicate with fellow students and researchers in the field. Even during my university career, it was common to study prose in languages such as Greek or Latin based on the time frames that certain items were written. In this case, the languages are considered dead, no longer spoken, so my work consisted mainly of translation, but to study prose around the world, you need to understand other languages. 

Religion is a major reason for wanting to learn a second language. Since most religions pre-date the English language, it is often important to be able to go back to the earliest version of a religious book to avoid misinterpretations or revisions. For example, Christians might learn Hebrew, Aramaic and Biblical Greek; Muslims might learn Classical Arabic, and Buddhists might learn Sanskrit. Missionaries and other religious types learn languages in order to spread their message. In fact, missionaries have played a major role in documenting languages and devising writing systems for many of them. There are also people out there like myself who find religions themselves fascinating and their languages are often a key as to the culture surrounding religious groups. 
Best Way to Learn a New Language? Although I wish there was, there really is no “best” way to learn a second language, because everyone learns slightly differently. The way I learn is going to be completely different than the way you learn, and there is little we can do about that. However, some methods appear to be more effective than others, and placing a heavier weight on them in an educational program may help a student to succeed. The desire to learn a language is quite admirable, and fortunately many support systems to teach languages to new learners exist around the world. The most important thing to remember is that learning a language can be frustrating at first, but it is worth the effort. The key to being successful in learning a new language is as simple as three words: Dedication, Endurance, and Perseverance. 

Many language teachers agree that immersion is an excellent way to learn a language. Immersion programs in the country where the language is spoken are especially valuable, as students must use the language outside of class as well as in it. In addition, students will learn more about the culture in which the language is spoken, which will give them context for their vocabulary. Most immersion grade schools insist on taking at least one trip to the place of the origin for the language to give students a chance to be forced to speak with native speakers. Some students benefit from taking a brief intensive in their native country before traveling to an immersion program or language school in a foreign country. The intensive establishes a foundation for the student to build upon as he or she learns. The great thing about immersion programs is that it forces the student to actually learn the new language rather than to simply regurgitate information or simply translate into your primary language ad nauseam. Use translation with dead languages, like Greek or Latin, because they are not going to change ever again, unlike every other language in the world that is dynamic and constantly changing. 

If you can find a course in the language you are interested in within your country, this is quite a good way to study. A variety of courses are usually available, including part-time and full-time courses, short intensive courses, and courses leading to qualifications. If you look around, you can probably find a course that suits your requirements. The main advantage of such courses is that you`ll have a teacher or tutor to provide you with instruction, support, feedback, and with whom to practice your language. You will also be studying with others who are at more or less the same level and you can compare notes with them and help one another. Taking a course is not for everyone, however as some people don`t feel comfortable in a classroom environment and prefer to study at their own pace and when it suits them, plus the costs are considerably higher than other options. 

There are many different courses designed for self-study that are now commonly available. These include textbooks, with or without cassettes or CDs, cassettes alone, videos, DVDs, and computer programs. Combination textbook audio tape courses are probably the most popular and are designed to give you an all round knowledge of a language. Some courses focus more on colloquial language while others concentrate more on reading and writing. Most courses are intended for complete beginners or people with only minimal knowledge of the language. Intermediate and advanced level courses are available for some of the more popular languages, such as French, German, Italian and Spanish. Computer courses are probably the most popular of all the options, and are designed to give you an all round knowledge of a language. Some of the better computer programs, like Rosetta Stone, are designed to give you the experience of an immersion program that does not do any translation so that you naturally pick up the language. The Rosetta Stone is pricy, but offers the choice of 31 different languages, all in an immersion setting. Obviously there are many similar products, but I mention this one only because I had success with it to learn Italian. 
Most Popular Languages The most popular language in the world is a tricky question to answer. If you simply go by the numbers, the number one language in the world is Mandarin Chinese with 882 million primary speakers, followed by Spanish with 325 million primary speakers, and followed by English in third place with 312 – 380 primary speakers. I think what the actual question in play is what is the easiest language to learn. I always like to start this answer by saying . . .learn the language you want to learn. Just because I tell you it may be hard, that is no reason why you should learn something little old me tells you too. Half the battle with learning a new language is that you can’t give up and you must dedicate yourself to your goal of learning that new language. Practice, practice, and then practice some more. Everyone looks and sound stupid when they first learned a new language, and there are even a lot of people out there like myself that sound stupid with their primary language as well. Just never give up. 

As far as ease goes, we can break the languages into three separate categories based on their ease of learning. The ""easiest"" languages for speakers of English, requiring approximately 600 hours of class work for proficiency are the Latin and Germanic languages such as Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese. The “medium” level, requiring approximately 1100 hours of class work for proficiency are the Slavic languages, Turkic languages, other Indo-European languages such as Persian, Hindi, and some non-Indo-Europeans such as Georgian and Hebrew. Languages like Arabic, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese languages are quite difficult because of strange phonemes, large number of tones, and complex writing systems to name a few. 
Conclusion Perhaps there was a time not too long ago that made it nearly impossible to learn a new language, but in today’s day and age, that strange language you hear now and then is accessible at anytime. At most university institutions throughout the world, there are courses being taught in all sorts of languages not just the mainstream languages like French, Spanish, German, and Japanese, but it is no longer uncommon to be able to learn Aboriginal languages or dead languages like Latin or Greek. A lot of people prefer to learn on their own, and prefer to go the more inexpensive rout by purchasing audio tapes, computer programs, or textbooks to learn at their own pace. The hardest part about learning a new language is that it is far too easy to just give up when the material begins to get tough. For those that are able to persevere, the sky is the limit when learning a second language, but you cannot get there without hard work. The most important part about learning a new language is to choose a language that is important to you and have fun with it. Once you start picking up the new language, the easiest thing to do is to practice talking to people who also speak that language because you will learn more in real life situations than from a book.",
Lucid Dreaming,"Lucid Dreaming Information  What does it mean? In the study of dreams, it was Frederik Van Eeden who came up with the name ‘Lucid Dreaming’. This specifies the state of your being in a dream and yet being conscious of what you are dreaming about. But the level of your lucidity solely depends on your mental strength and stability to focus or center on this particular dream and to be able to control it to whatever degree required. This can be impulsive or planned. There are many instances where people do not realize that they are having a lucid dream and it may seem to them that they are awake. But this is not so; this is far from our physical nature where we are completely aware and awake. 
Does it really help you? Desire to learn and remain strongly focused is a very crucial requirement. It is not at all difficult, but becomes an intense performance. This can be achieved by anyone who is interested in the ‘dream’ world and has the capability to recollect those dreams and not forget them. You can actually for a long period of time be in control and make whatever changes or decisions needed to be taken. This is your sheet of blank paper, feel free to create what you want. You have the freedom to bring in or do away with any character or things that you want. It is a great feeling to be completely in control, isn’t it? 

Be experimental and be free, and you never know what you can create. In a way you will also learn more about the spiritual side of you, the side that is unseen and yet exists. It gets you in touch with it and creates a kind of relationship between your natural and mystical self. There are two halves of every person, discover and learn to love the other half. Give your dream the direction that you want by being in control and being free. More than any other virtual reality show is Lucid Dreaming, which is your very own and more realistic. It is not time bound but is ‘self centric’, depending on your need to dream and create a lucid state where you are, where you want to be. 
How do I start? This may be your question. It is not tough. First of all you should be sure whether you want to be lucid in your dreams. The next is you just need to keep telling yourself that you want to be lucid and fully aware in your dreams. By repeating this, you are actually creating a powerful base in your subconscious, which is the key to effective Lucid Dreaming. Without which it will become a little difficult. Prepare well and in advance. 

Then learn to accept it as a natural occurrence that most people have every night. But you say to yourself, that you are able to be lucid in your dreams, rather than just ordinarily dream. This brings you one step closer. 

After this, encourage yourself to feel eager and happy about becoming aware and lucid in your dreams. If you are unsure or hesitant, then try to remove that feeling, as it will create an unseen wall for you, in your path to discover lucid dreaming. Be strong and sure in your decision and don’t falter from that. 

When you realize that you have finally opened your inner self and permitted lucid dreams to have control over you, then you are finally ready to imply some methods to make it a success.   
Method It is commonly used and is very effective in the field of Lucid Dreaming. This can be done every night before you go to bed. It is called the ‘Castaneda Approach’, which is good and effective for beginners. Here is what you are supposed to do every night: 

1. Seat yourself comfortably on your bed and calm yourself down by telling yourself that you are forgetting all that occurred through the day. 

2. Look at an object and focus and in a calm manner tell yourself when you dream tonight it will be with the help of this object. 

3. Keep looking at the object and repeat to yourself mentally, when you see this object, you will know you are dreaming. 

4. At this point you might get a little cross eyed and drowsy, but continue repeating the intention to get lucid. 

5. After a few minutes when you are too exhausted or drowsy, quit doing this. But remind yourself one last time and lie yourself down. 

6. When you awaken at night, ask yourself if you saw that object in your dreams. If not, don’t sweat. Keep doing this regularly every night and make sure that the atmosphere is conducive to your experiment. 

7. It is guaranteed, after a few days you will see that object in your dreams. In fact when it happens, you will feel exalted and know that this is a ‘dream’. Don’t lose control but very calmly go through the entire dream and savor it completely. Afterwards, when you awake, take time out to write down in detail the events that took place in your Lucid Dream. Go ahead and create a dream diary, listing all the details. 
Practice makes one perfect If you want to be an expert in Lucid Dreaming, you need to make it a practice, for only this will make you perfect. Make it a point to wake yourself up and remember the last dream, as much in detail as you can. Your intention means everything. Be confident about being lucid in the next dream, it helps. Any musical instrument is not learnt overnight, but only through rigorous practice schedules. So is it with Lucid Dreaming 
Fallbacks After many weeks, you still are not lucid? This may be due to some internal constraining factors, which could be any of these. Either you are afraid, your interest is half baked because you don’t really believe in it, you think it requires more effort, you are too tired to practice or try to remember the dreams, your life is too stressful and you cannot concentrate. We need to first start by facing these little fears and creating a congenial environment for Lucid Dreaming. If you are able to do so, you are well on your way to successfully be in control of your dreams.",
Camping,"Camping Information  Introduction Are you looking to get away from the crowds and back into nature? Camping is the way to go. This hobby covers a range of skills and dates back to the very lifeblood connection of humans to the wild, where gathering food, collecting water, and improving means of shelter was not an option. Fortunately, most of the today’s society has access to everyday comforts and knows the luxury of choosing how intimately it would like to be connected again with nature. In general, camping is the act of leaving the entrapments of social life and spending time outdoors in more primitive circumstances. Whether this means leaving town and staying at an recreational vehicle (RV) park, kayaking several miles along a river to set up a tent and fish for your dinner, or taking a several-day sabbatical on a secluded mountain shelf, there are probably enough outdoor opportunities (and equipment merchants) to cover your every need to make your escape a reality. 

Camping describes a range of activities. Survivalist campers set off with little more than their boots, whereas recreational vehicle travelers arrive equipped with their own electricity, heat, and patio furniture. Camping is often enjoyed in conjunction with activities, such as: hiking, whitewater kayaking, hill walking, climbing, canoeing, mountain biking, motorcycling, swimming, and fishing. Camping may be combined with hiking either as backpacking or as a series of day hikes from a central location. It does not, however, apply to cultures whose technology does not include sophisticated dwellings. 
Scouting Other than the original scouts and fur traders who carved their way into the wild unknown of the early frontier, scouting today pretty much refers to the Boy Scouts. Originally founded in 1907 by Robert Baden-Powell in England, the organization for boys (and later Girl Scouts also), his work was loosely based on his past experiences in the British Army as Lieutenant General. Today’s worldwide movement employs what is known as the “Scout Method,” emphasizing important life skills such as camping, woodcraft, hiking, backpacking, and sports. 

The Scout Law and Promise embody the joint values of the Scouting movement worldwide, and bind all Scouting associations together. The emphasis on ""learning by doing"" provides experiences and hands-on orientation as a practical method of learning and building self-confidence. Small groups build unity, camaraderie, and a close-knit fraternal atmosphere. These experiences, along with an emphasis on trustworthiness and personal honor, help to develop responsibility, character, self-reliance, self-confidence, reliability, and readiness; which eventually lead to collaboration and leadership. A program with a variety of progressive and attractive activities expands a Scout`s horizon and bonds the Scout even more to the group. Activities and games provide an enjoyable way to develop skills such as dexterity. In an outdoor setting, they also provide contact with the natural environment. 

The sense of confidence and competence that results from the scouting experience, especially as it relates to outdoor and camping skills is unique and valuable. Other than the one-on-one training that can pass from parent to son or daughter, joining with a pack or troop allows first-time campers to learn with ease and benefit from a group experience that might not be found anywhere else. Scouts learn how to safely build and start campfires and tie various types of knots. They learn about wildlife and about what to do when confronted with a wild animal. They learn how to prepare food outdoors, pitch tents, canoe and kayak, do rock climbing, fish, go caving, and shoot with bows and arrows. Many have their first experience with rifles while in the scouts (this is a real advantage, since they’re learning that safety principles are for everyone at all times). A large number of the available merit badges are for one sort of survival skill or another. 
Survival Skills Survival skills are techniques a person may use to help other people or a person in a dangerous situation such as natural disasters. Generally speaking, these techniques are meant to provide the basic necessities for human life: water, food, shelter, habitat, and the need to think straight, to signal for help, to navigate safely, to avoid unpleasant interactions with animals and plants, and for first aid. In addition, survival skills are often basic ideas and abilities that ancient humans had to use for thousands of years, so these skills are partially a reenactment of history. Many of these skills are the ways to enjoy extended periods of time in remote places, or a way to thrive in nature. Some people use these skills to better appreciate nature and for recreation, not just survival. 

Our ancestors were in reality survivalists because they were self sufficient. They were responsible for one’s own self and family, protection, health, and sustenance as well as shelter. This is what our ancestors knew and lived every day. They were prepared for what life brings through planning, learning, and preparing for any possible future. Through education we can teach people how to survive more than one day at a time. We can teach them how to feed themselves and their families for life, be prepared for future unknown and the basic art of human survival to be pasted on for generations to come. Such skills are presented as useful in situations such as storms or earthquakes or in dangerous locations such as desert, mountains, and jungle. Every different situation or location is said to present a different range of dangers. Though different sources assign varying numbers of most important elements for survival, most will agree on the following: the order of priority of survival needs shifts according to the immediate situation faced. 

One widely circulated concept to help set priorities is called the ""Rule of Three."" Employed a mnemonic device, the Rule of Three states: 

1. Humans cannot survive more than three hours exposed to extremely high or low temperatures. 2. Humans cannot survive more than 6 days without water. 3. Humans cannot survive more than nine days without food. 

The Rule of Three is often otherwise formulated and is viewed by commentators as a rough guide. An aircrew reportedly lasted 8 days without water in a life raft. People have survived without food for over twenty-one days. In 1998, Alaskan fireman Robert Bogucki survived for 12 days without water and 36 days with nearly no food in the Great Sandy Desert, Western Australia. The Boy Scouts, in addition to listing seven priorities, use a mnemonic device, ""STOP,"" to address the mental aspects of survival. ""STOP"" stands for ""Stop, Think, Observe, Plan."" Following are some of the very basic wilderness survival terms and how they might be accommodated. 

Shelter is anything that protects a person from his/her environment, including dangerous cold and heat, allowing for restful sleep (a human need). A shelter can range from a ""natural shelter,"" such as a cave or a fallen-down (cracked but not split) thickly-foliaged tree, to an intermediate form of man-made shelter such as a debris shelter, a ditch dug next to a tree log and covered with foliage, or a snow cave, to completely man-made structures such as a tarp, tent, or house. 

The ability to start a controlled fire is recognized as significant in increasing the ability to survive physically and mentally. The skills required to light a fire without a lighter or matches, such as by using natural flint and steel with tinder, is a frequent subject of both books on survival and in survival courses. There is an emphasis placed on practicing fire-making skills before venturing into the wilderness. Fire is presented as a tool meeting many survival needs. The heat provided by a fire allows the body to be warmed, wet clothes to be dried, water to be disinfected, and food to be cooked. Not to be overlooked is the psychological boost and the sense of safety and protection it gives. Fire may deter wild animals from interfering with the survivor, or wild animals may be attracted to the light and heat of a fire. The light and smoke emitted by a fire can also be used to work at night and can signal rescue units. 

A human being can survive an average of three to five days without the intake of water, assuming sea-level altitude, room temperature and favorable relative humidity. In colder or warmer temperatures, the need for water is greater. Need for water also increases with exercise. A typical person will lose 2-3 liters of water per day under ordinary conditions, and more in hot, dry, or cold weather. Four to six liters of water or other liquids are generally required each day in the wilderness to avoid dehydration and to keep the body functioning properly. The U.S. Army survival manual recommends that you drink water whenever thirsty. Other groups recommend rationing water through ""water discipline."" A lack of water causes dehydration, which may result in lethargy, headaches, dizziness, confusion, and eventually death. Even mild dehydration reduces endurance and impairs concentration, which is dangerous in a survival situation where clear thinking is essential. Dark yellow or brown urine is a diagnostic indicator of dehydration. To avoid dehydration, a high priority is typically assigned to locating a supply of drinking water and making provision to render that water as safe as possible. Many sources in survival literature, as well as forums and online references, list the ways in which water may be gathered and rendered safer for consumption in a survival situation, such as boiling, filtering, chemicals, solar radiation + heat/SODIS, and distillation. Such sources also often list the dangers, such as pollutants, microorganisms, or pathogens which affect the safety of back country water. Recent thinking is that boiling or commercial filters are significantly safer than use of chemicals, with the exception of chlorine dioxide. The issues presented by the need for water dictate that unnecessary water loss by perspiration be avoided in survival situations. To thus avoid these problems, culinary root tubers, fruit, edible mushrooms, edible nuts, edible beans, edible cereals or edible leaves, edible moss, edible cacti and algae can be searched and if needed, prepared (mostly by boiling). With the exception of leaves, these foods are relatively high in calories, providing some energy to the body. Plants are some of the easiest food sources to find in the jungle, forest or desert because they`re stationary and can thus be had without exerting much effort. Also, many commentators discuss the knowledge, skills, and equipment (such as bows, snares and nets) necessary to gather animal food in the wild through animal trapping, hunting, and fishing. Some survival books promote the ""Universal Edibility Test."" Allegedly, one can distinguish edible foods from toxic ones by a series of progressive exposures to skin and mouth prior to ingestion, with waiting periods and checks for symptoms. However, many other experts, including Ray Mears and John Kallas, reject this method, stating that even a small amount of some ""potential foods"" can cause physical discomfort, illness, or death. An additional step called the scratch test is sometimes included to evaluate the edibility of a potential food. Focusing on survival until rescued by presumed searchers, The Boy Scouts of America especially discourages foraging for wild foods on the grounds that the knowledge and skills needed are unlikely to be possessed by those finding themselves in a wilderness survival situation, making the risks (including use of energy) outweigh the benefits. 
First Aid First aid (wilderness first aid in particular) can help a person survive and function with injuries and illnesses that would otherwise kill or incapacitate him/her. Common and dangerous injuries include: 

• Lacerations, which may become infected • Bites or stings from venomous animals, such as: snakes, scorpions, spiders, bees, stingrays, jellyfish, catfish, etc. • Bites leading to disease/septicemia, such as: mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, animals infected with rabies, sand flies, komodo dragons, crocodilians, etc. • Infection through food, animal contact, or drinking non-potable water • Bone fractures • Sprains, particularly of the ankle • Burns • Poisoning from consumption of, or contact with, poisonous plants or poisonous fungi • Hypothermia (too cold) and hyperthermia (too hot) • Heart attack • Hemorrhage 

The survivor may need to use contents from a first aid kit or, if possessing the required knowledge, naturally-occurring medicinal plants, immobilize injured limbs, or even transport incapacitated comrades. 
Opportunities Opportunities for camping are only as limited as your imagination. You can choose your back yard or even your living room, if your tent is small enough. This is a good, controlled environment for testing your tent setup skills. You can experiment by sleeping outside to see what items you find yourself missing by the time your head hits the pillow (if you’ve remembered to bring your pillow). If you’ve chosen RV camping, do a bit of homework after you’ve chosen your destination but before you depart. Use the internet to research RV-friendly camp sites along your route, including price comparisons, amenities, and even what sort of scenery you can expect to see from your pull outs once you’ve hooked up. Consider making your first camping experiences short ones, preferably for just an overnight or two. If you have a GPS and maps, bring them along to help you navigate; compasses are great, but they are only as good as their users. Bring others with you the first few times, especially if they are seasoned campers—observation is a very effective mode of education. 

Next, start branching out. Find an event—it can be anything, such as a music or arts festival, fishing derby, motorcycle rally, or dog show a few hundred miles from your home. See how well you do on your own. Or, if you are anxious to try your wings at solitary camping, study state park maps and customize your trip. Once you are comfortable, you can work toward more skilled camping, such as hiking or climbing several miles to get to your ideal camping spot. At this point, though, you should be willing to carry in water, food, and some of the crucial first aid items. 

Some of the best-planned trips go awry when bad weather hits. These are the days of pouring rain, impasses of mud, fog, and cold that chills to the bone. To help alleviate the disappointment of such times, try to bring along a few “creature comforts,” if at all possible. This might be a paperback book or a deck of cards to use in your car or tent. Perhaps you might have travel brochures you picked up from the visitor’s center nearest the area you’re in. You can always be working on your “B Plan” for use when the weather clears up. If you’re doing social camping, this is the time to bond better with your fellow travelers and learn more about interests you have in common. 

Whatever destination you choose as your next adventure, allow extra time for good things to come to you. If you’re alone, take time before you zip up the tent at night to look up at the stars you’ve perhaps not seen in as many numbers before. Listen to the sounds of life continuing in movement as you fall asleep. In the morning, peek out to watch for wildlife that might be lingering in the area to graze. Without doing these things, you’re only going through the motions of camping rather than experiencing it.",
Ice Fishing,"Ice Fishing Information  Introduction Fly fishing is a distinct and ancient angling method which uses flies that are cast with a special fishing rod and line. 

Fly fishing can be done in fresh or salt water. Freshwater fishing is often divided into coldwater (trout, salmon, steelhead), coolwater (pike, perch, walleye), warmwater (bass, chub, catfish) fishing. The techniques for freshwater fly fishing also differ in lakes, streams and rivers. 

Mastering the casting technique used in fly fishing is akin to an art form. Devoted fly anglers describe their sport as an art, an addiction or sometimes even a religion. 

Beginners might find fly fishing difficult to master, but it is a rewarding hobby that inspires loyalty among anglers. Successful fly fishing requires knowing the feeding patterns of targeted fish species, understanding the life stages of the creatures consumed by the targeted fish, and learning to tie complicated knots. Fly anglers may also choose to learn how to create the complicated fishing lures rather than buying them. 

Some veteran fly anglers claim the hobby creates a connection with nature which, when coupled with this new self-awareness, leads to spiritual awakening. 
Learning the sport Beginners might find fly fishing to be a difficult and daunting pursuit at first. They must perfect a casting technique if they hope to catch a fish. And the casts must successfully “hit” a target that is swimming fast. Beginners must learn about the flies and insects eaten by the fish they are pursuing. They must learn how to tie a wide variety of knots. But expert fly anglers agree that learning these basics is well worth the effort due to the high degree of enjoyment found in fly fishing. 

To learn the sport, novices should read some of the many books written on fly fishing. Books on fly fishing are available at local libraries, and can be bought online or at local book stores. Instructional videos on fly fishing are another option for the beginner seeking more information. 

Check to see if there is a local fly fishing club. Visit a fly shop in the area and ask assistance from the staff. 

Tap the vast knowledge possessed by experienced fly anglers. Ask veteran fly fishermen for help. The fly fishing community is tight-knit, and members will likely be gratified to impart their wisdom to those new to the hobby. 

Beginning fly anglers may also learn more about the sport by taking a class. Classes and workshops are offered by fishing clubs, fly shops and sporting goods stores, and by fishing guides. An online search can help both the beginning fly fisherman and the experienced angler find classes on the sport. The famed outfitter Orvis offers classes at 14 fly fishing schools in the United States. 

Before buying fly fishing equipment, beginners should decide what fish they are targeting and what type of water they will be visiting. The answers to those questions determine what type of equipment is needed for the sport. Some expert fly fishermen suggest that beginners should initially buy a modestly priced fly fishing rod and reel to get used to the new hobby. Then they can supplement their fly fishing gear with new purchases after learning the basics in their new outdoor pursuit. 

Fly fishing gear can be costly. An angler can pay more than $700 for a fly fishing rod, but there are decent models costing approximately $100. A fly angler might pay more than $400 for a reel, but less expensive models are available for around $50. Despite the costs of fly fishing equipment, a beginner can get properly outfitted at a reasonable price by focusing on the basics and shunning the many tempting gadgets offered for sale. Beginners should also check out the sales offered by outfitters. 
Types of fish Fly fishing is not just for pursuing trout, although that remains a dominant part of the sport. Fly anglers also pursue many species of both freshwater fish and saltwater fish. 

Freshwater fish varieties caught by fly anglers include perch, chub, catfish, salmon, bass, pike, panfish, grayling, rainbow trout, steelhead trout and golden trout. 

Saltwater varieties pursued by fly anglers include shark, surfperch, redfish, snook, tarpon, bonefish, halibut and marlin. 
Tying flies Fly anglers can buy lures, but some choose to tie their own. Tying artificial flies is considered an art form among anglers. It requires studying the feeding habits of whichever fish species the angler is targeting, and understanding the life cycles of the creatures which the lures are designed to resemble. 

Anglers, either beginners or veterans, can learn to tie flies by reading books or watching videos. Numerous websites offer online instruction on tying flies. 
Types of lures Anglers may choose which fly to use during a fishing expedition by observing the insects in the water and in the air at their targeted fishing site. 

The word flies is used to describe fly fishing bait for both freshwater and saltwater fishing, but the lures resemble many life forms on which fish feed. These include crustaceans, insects, mammals, reptiles and amphibians. 

Artificial flies are either sub-surface flies which go below the water’s surface, or artificial lures are surface flies which stay on top of the water. 

Artificial flies are either imitators or attractors. Imitators mimic insects and fool the fish into striking. Attractors incite the fish into an aggressive response and strike. 

Dry flies are artificial lures that float on the surface. They typically resemble adult insects. 

Wet flies are artificial lures that sink under the water rather than floating on the surface. They resemble immature life forms which appear to be trying to swim to the water’s surface. 

Nymphs are artificial flies made to look like the immature stage of insects and crustaceans. Streamers are artificial flies that look like minnows and other creatures that are found swimming below the water’s surface. 
Other gear for fly fishing The fly angler needs to buy a good-quality fly line that matches the rod and fishing conditions. Wading gear is traditionally used for protection from the water. Waders come in lengths that are hip high and chest high. Waders are manufactured in boot-foot style with the boots attached and in stocking-foot style with no boots. 

Some fly anglers in warm climates have been known to brave the water by forgoing waders and walking into the water sporting a pair of sturdy athletic shoes. 

A fishing vest with many large pockets is one of the most important pieces of gear worn by a fly angler. The vest holds everything needed for that particular fishing expedition. The vest must serve as a wearable tackle box because the fly angler is typically standing in water for prolonged periods and thus does not have easy access to these items. 

Some fly anglers use a wading staff to help keep their footing and prevent falling. Wading staffs, some of which are collapsible and costly, can be purchased at stores or online. But some anglers save money by fashioning a wading staff out of a broom handle or mop handle. 

Other accessories carried by fly anglers include sunscreen, insect repellant and first-aid kits. 

Additional gear needed by a fly angler includes flotation devices for personal safety, fly boxes for holding bait and forceps for removing hooks. A pair of polarized sunglasses will make the fish easier to see. A hat will serve many functions, including protecting the angler’s head and face from the sun, improving the angler’s ability to see the fish, and protecting the face from accidental collision with the hook and fly line. 
Conclusion Mastering the sport of fly fishing takes effort, concentration and even a bit of money to obtain the necessary gear. But the rewards are great. Fly fishing aficionados describe the sport as an art, addiction and even a religion. Fly angling is gaining in popularity. The sport offers a rewarding experience in a beautiful, outdoor setting along with the camaraderie shared with other fly anglers.",
RC Planes,"RC Planes Information  Introduction There are a number of different RC planes from which you can choose, as well as a horde of equipment and accessory possibilities. The first thing you need to do is decide exactly what you are looking for in a radio-controlled airplane. It is important to understand all of the options that are available to you. 

A radio-controlled aircraft (often called RC aircraft or RC plane) is a model aircraft that is controlled remotely, typically with a hand-held transmitter and a receiver within the craft. 

Piloting a RC plane is like controlling your own air strike force. You are in complete control and awaiting commands. If you are interested in electronics or mechanical devices, the advanced designs and components of RC planes will fascinate you. 

Flying radio-controlled planes is actually quite an exhilarating hobby. RC planes encompass a number of different areas of excitement, both technical and artistic. No other hobby allows you to become involved in so many diverse skills and topics, such as woodworking, electronics, small motors, aerodynamics and the great outdoors. 
History of RC Planes Today, it is common for many people to purchase and build RC planes. With patience, discipline and lots of practice, just about anyone can learn to fly a radio-controlled airplane. This hobby has been around since the 1800s, but it has come a long way from the experimental, rudimentary designs of yesteryear. 

In the early 1870s, Alphose Penaud was known as the father of flying models. When he first launched his Planophere in Paris at the Tileries, he brought a fascination to life. On its initial flight, the Planophere flew for one hundred thirty-one feet. Many people became inspired, believing in the potential of powered flight. 

Even though Alphose Penaud initially worked with model helicopters, the Planophere was designed as a model airplane that was powered by winding up a rubber band. The design featured the first cruciform tail, which is the typical design that is often used today with a tail that resembles a cross when you look at it from behind. 

RC hobbyists were the first to build remote controlled planes using materials like balsa wood and building the crafts by hand. The process took an extended amount of time and required great patience. In the beginning, creative hobbyists who wanted to enhance the designs were limited because there were not any customizable parts available. However, all homemade RC planes have a certain uniqueness because they are made by hand.   

With the early seventies came an increase in the production of low cost, rechargeable batteries, causing a revolution in the world of RC planes. Affordable, convenient, quiet motors that were capable of running on rechargeable batteries were the power source for these RC planes. In combination with the newly available materials such as foam, plastic and fiber glass resin, these motors opened the door for the sale of ready-to-fly RC planes and those that are almost ready-to-fly. These types of planes are the RC planes that many people today have come to know and love. 
Types of RC Planes You can get RC planes that are designed to fly indoors, or you can get an RC plane that is almost as big as your house. RC planes and kits are available that will fit into any budget no matter how great or small. Some RC planes are so simple that anyone can fly them, while others are so complex that it takes years of experience to learn how to pilot such machines properly. You can fly some RC planes right in your backyard, while other radio-controlled airplanes are best flown in large open spaces. No matter how much experience you have flying or how much money you are willing to spend, there is a RC plane out there for you.  
Radio Control Scale Aircraft Modeling Perhaps the most realistic form of aeromodeling, in its main purpose to replicate full-scale aircraft designs from aviation history, for testing of future aviation designs, or even to realize never-built ""proposed"" aircraft, is that of radio control scale aeromodeling. RC Scale model aircraft can be of any type of steerable airship lighter-than-air (LTA) aviation craft, or more normally, of the heavier-than-air fixed wing glider/sailplane, fixed-wing single or multi-engine aircraft, or rotary-wing aircraft such as autogyros or helicopters.  
Gliders The simplest form of RC planes comes in the shape of radio-controlled gliders. This type of RC plane is a great way to enjoy the peace and relaxation that comes with the hobby of piloting RC planes. 

Most radio-controlled gliders have two channels, controlling either elevator and aileron or elevator and rudder. The elevator and rudder control option is by far the most popular among RC plane pilots. However, combat gliders and aerobatic gliders require quality maneuverability, so in such as case ailerons are preferred. 

Radio-controlled gliders, such as the Thunder Tiger Windstar, are incredibly stable when they are in the air. In addition, RC gliders are actually quite simple to fly. This type of radio-controlled airplane can be flown from flat land or from a slope using some kind of system for launching, such as a bungee/high-start system. 

Flying RC planes of this type, especially the Windstar, is an amazingly peaceful experience. The typical flying speeds of radio-controlled glider planes are much, much slower than the speeds of the powered planes, giving the pilot ample time to react. The high polyhedral wing that is featured on RC glider planes like the Windstar provides exceptional stability. This type of RC glider is very forgiving in flight because it naturally wants to level itself back out following every turn. 

The large wing section on these planes generates great amounts of lift. This means that with air conditions that are favorable, you will be able to keep your plane aloft for quite a while after all your pilot buddies are stopping to refuel and recharge their powered airplanes. 

In addition, RC gliders of this type require few, if any, accessories. If you are looking for a quiet plane to pilot this particular plane type is ideal. The only question on your mind as you are enjoying hours and hours of flying is whether the batteries in your radio gear are going to hold up for the entire time of your flight. 

Another option that you have if you are interested in piloting RC gliders is the powered glider. Powered RC gliders are simply a standard radio-controlled glider that features a small electric motor that is fitted with a folding propeller. An example of this type of RC glider is the Radian RTF from ParkZone. 

When you turn the power on with this type of glider and perform a normal hand launch, you can fly your powered glider all the way up to a height that suits you, and then you can turn the motor off and continue to fly. When you stop the motor on a powered RC glider, the wind that goes over the glider will push the propeller blades back, thus reducing the drag with the blades sitting tight up against the side of the plane nose. If your RC glider begins to lose altitude, all you have to do is simply turn the power back on for the motor. The blades on the propeller will return to the normal position, allowing you to climb up, up and away once more. 

To RC plane purists, powered gliders may seem like cheating, but they are gliders all the same. The most obvious advantage to flying powered gliders over the usual RC glider planes is that you do not need to find a cliff or hilltop, nor do you have to search for a space that is large enough to use a bungee system. Powered RC glider planes are easily launched from flat ground. In addition, these RC planes can be flown in spaces that are too small to allow the use of a bungee system. 

Piloting a powered RC glider plane, such as the Radian RTF, is a fantastic way for you to experience a relaxing gentle radio-controlled flight. With the powered glider, you get the best of both worlds because you get the tranquility of flying a glider with the option for power. 

Hand launched RC glider planes are specifically designed to throw upwards. These RC gliders are typically smaller than other RC planes, making them easier to manage. An example of a simple two-channel hand launch glider is the Fling from Great Planes. The Fling features an easy high-start system for launching. This means that if your throws are not very strong, you will still be able to get your RC plane airborne. Once you launch your glider, it relies on thermals to remain in the air. 

From Great Planes also comes another type of RC glider, the Fling DL. The Fling DL is a recently available type of radio-controlled glider plane that is quickly gaining popularity known as a discus launch glider. The discus launch glider features a special design that allows it to be launched by holding the wingtip, spinning around three hundred sixty degrees and then flinging it into the air. The launching motion is similar to that which an athlete would use to throw a discus into the air, hence the name. 

The greatest advantage of the discus launch RC glider is that you do not have to be on a hilltop, nor do you have to be in a wide-open space. You can launch your discus launch glider from a relatively small space, just as long as you have room for it to go into the air vertically. 

Finally, you have combat gliders. Combat gliders a fairly new to the RC plane market. This type of glider is typically smaller than the traditional gliders. In addition, these planes are made out of EPP foam, which is incredibly resilient to damage. This type of RC glider is used to attempt to knock an opponent’s plane out of the air. Since these planes are not damaged easily, you can have hours of fun flying into one another at full speed.  
Jets Jets tend to be very expensive and commonly use a micro turbine or ducted fan to power them. Most airframes are constructed from fiber glass and carbon fiber. Inside the aircraft, wooden spars reinforce the body to make a rigid airframe . They also have kevlar fuel tanks for the Jet A fuel that they run on. Most micro turbines start with propane, burn for a few seconds before introducing the jet fuel by solenoid. These aircraft can often reach speeds in excess of 320 km/h (200 mph).  
Toy RC Planes The number of toy RC planes that have showed up on store shelves over the past few years is astounding. There was a time when it was close to impossible, partially due to the expense, to find anything other than a large multi-channel RC plane kit that you needed plans to build. These days, due to the advances in technology, miniature radio control components are being used to produce toy RC planes at a price anyone can afford.  
Pylon racers Racers are small propeller aircraft that race around a 2, 3, or 4 pylon track. They tend to be hard to see and can often go over 240 km/h (150 mph), though some people do pylon races with much slower aircraft. Although several different types of aircraft are raced across the world, those flown primarily in the US are; Q500 (424 or ARPRA, and 428), and Q40. 424 is designed as a starting point into the world of pylon racing. 
RC Plane Kits As more and more interchangeable parts became available from manufacturers on the retail market, RC plane kits quickly became popular. Anyone who was able to follow instructions could build an RC plane. With this, the hobby of piloting radio-controlled airplanes expanded dramatically. The first RC plane kits were powered by wound rubber bands and gas engines, or they were launched into the air with a winch. The required field tromping and elbow grease are the only things that still limited the hobby. 
RC Plane Frequencies and Channels A specific number of radio frequencies are lawfully designated for the use of radio-controlled airplanes and other aircrafts that are controlled by an FM RC system. These frequencies fall into a 72 MHz band. Every individual frequency is designated a unique channel number. 

The channel number has nothing to do with the amount of channels that the RC plane has, it is simple the same word with a separate meaning. For example, if an RC plane is a four-channel plane, it means that the plane features four controllable functions, including ailerons, elevator, rudder and throttle. This does not mean that the plane is being flown on channel four. 
Military Usage of RC Planes The military has been using PC planes for a number of different missions since as far back as the start of the twentieth century. These planes are the ideal way for the armed forces to practice and develop various maneuvers and strategies without risking harm to soldiers. 
Conclusion If you are interested in flying, there is no better way to get your fix than by piloting one of the many radio-controlled airplanes that are currently available on the market. No matter if you have been flying before of if it is your first time, you are sure to love the feeling of excitement that comes from flying RC planes. There is nothing better than the rush that comes from launching a plane that you built with your very own hands into the air, except maybe the amazing feeling of maneuvering a powerful machine that you saved for and honed your skills to be able to fly. 

The greatest thing about radio-controlled airplanes is the fact that they can be enjoyed by anyone, no matter how young or old, and no matter how skilled or experienced they may be.",
Papier-Mache,"Papier-Mache Information  Introduction There are few people that don`t remember paper-mâché, also known more simply as paper-mache or in the original French of papier-mâché, as a favorite pastime and art project in school. While paper-mâché certainly is terrific for younger children, it is a also a great medium for creating sculptures, reliefs, masks and virtually any other type of dimensional art. 

Paper-mâché is definitely very environmentally friendly and can be created completely from recycled materials and basic household kitchen ingredients. It is durable, long lasting, lightweight and can be finished with a variety of types of covering. Painting, staining, texturizing and glazing are all possible to give paper-mâché a very different look. Historically this form of design and art has been used for everything from symbols of royalty through to actual furniture, artwork and even for making ammunition. 

Getting started with paper-mâché is a great way for everyone in the family to explore their artistic side. Since the supplies required are very low to no cost and you don`t need specialized equipment it is fun and easy. The versatility of this medium really does make it a excellent starting point for virtually any type of decoration, design or three dimensional piece.   Treating the completed and dried paper-mâché project with paint and a lacquer type of finish will make the entire project water resistant and very durable. Wire frames and plastic bases can also add stability and strength to any paper-mâché project. 

So, if you were thinking paper-mâché artwork was those models of the planets you did in 6th grade, think again. The sky is the limit with what you can do with this very traditional type of art that has come back into vogue again. 
Supplies And Equipment The basic supplies and equipment for paper-mâché are all things you probably already have in your home and kitchen or laundry. The most important elements are the paper, the frame and the glue or paste that you use. 

The paper can be any type of porous paper. Typically that is paper that is matte and not shiny. Regular newspaper or brown paper bags are great examples of porous types of paper that absorbs moisture. Other papers that work include the matte type of gift wrap and paper towels. Plain use computer printer paper or the old style of computer paper that folds and tears for dot matrix printers is excellent. 

If you are using newspaper it is always a good idea to ensure that the last coat of the paper-mâché is a white colored paper without newsprint. This is important if you are painting or decorating the outside with lighter colors. The newsprint will continue to bleed through or be visible through light colored paints. However you can also apply a layer of acrylic paint or a good paint primer over the newspaper and before the decorative paint to ensure that your colors stay true. 

The paper needs to be torn or cut into strips that are appropriately sized for the type of decoration or design you are creating. Wider strips are good for large surfaces while narrower strips are a must for smaller designs. Using strips that are too wide will make corners and detailed areas of the design rough and bumpy looking while narrow strips make corners smoother since the paper cannot buckle out at the turn. 

The glue or paste that you use can be a variety of products. Liquid starch, which can be purchased with laundry supplies at most grocery stores, is a very simple option for creating the paste. The starch is used full strength, just dip paper into the liquid, remove the excess and apply the paper to the mold. Wallpaper paste can also be used as a simple glue, dilute only as much as necessary to form a thick, creamy solution that is quick and easy to use. 

You can also make your own starch mixture with a simple recipe. To a heat proof bowl add half a box of cornstarch and enough cold water to make a thick paste. The water has to be cold, you don`t want to actually start the thickening process at this time. The cornstarch will not dissolve completely but the consistency at this point should be like heavy cream. To this add at least one and a half liters of boiling water, approximately 7 cups, and stir vigorously to prevent lumps from forming. If you have an electric mixer this can really help. 

The paste should be thick and will become translucent once the cornstarch is cooked in the mixture. If it is too thick add small amounts of boiling water. It should be similar to the consistency of Jello just before it sets up, not watery but also not solid, more like a very thick glue or a paint. Adding a teaspoon or two of salt will help prevent spoilage if you need to keep the paste for more than a day or two. The paste can be warmed slightly in the microwave and whipped again before each use. In most cases the paste will only last two to four days before it will need to be disposed of and a new batch made. Any paste that smells sour or moldy should be tossed out. 

You can also use any type of white glue or arts and crafts glue diluted with plain cold water to reach the desired consistency, or you may be able to find paper-mâché paste at your local arts and crafts store. These two options tend to last much longer and do not have the spoilage concern of the homemade variety. 

Besides paper and paste you will also need something to act as a frame for your paper-mâché project. Any type of solid or structurally sound type of frame will work well. A balloon inflated to the desired size is perfect for round shapes but make sure to use good quality balloons that won`t pop or deflate before the paper-mâché exterior is dry and solid. Empty soda bottles, either the liter, two liter or the smaller bottles are a good shape and frame for bodies and center parts of designs. The plastic can be cut to make arms, legs and other shapes that are glued on or attached to the bottle prior to applying the paper-mâché. 

For those that want to try larger art there are a variety of options for either making your own shapes using stiff, thin wire or buying wire frames at the craft store. These frames can be in the shape of boxes, baskets or the traditional types of frames for animals, humans, houses and other shapes often used for seasonal decorations. If you are just getting started a simple shape to allow you to get the knack of spreading the paper strips evenly and consistently is highly recommended. The more corners and shapes you have to cover the more difficult getting a completely smooth surface will be, so starting simple really is important. 

Paints and texturizing sprays can be used to add color and interesting features to the completely paper-mâché project. Be sure to use acrylic paints and avoid any water based paints as they can rehydrate the paper-mâché and cause mold problems. As mentioned above a solid white primer coat that can be sprayed over the entire project is a good idea to ensure an even base coat regardless of what type of paper you used. 

For some kinds of paper-mâché using gift wrap with a nice glossy, clear drying paste is all the decoration that is needed. If you are attempting this type of project it is highly recommended to use the liquid starch paste or use a watered down glue to give that high gloss finish without the slightly dull look of the homemade paste. Finishing with a spray or paint on lacquer product adds that really high gloss look that is so eye catching in a variety of Christmas and holiday decorations. This is also a great option for making boxes and baskets that are either painted or have decorative paper used right in the paper-mâché. Regardless if you use a high gloss or a matte type of spray finish it is important to seal the paper-mâché work. This includes all sides, including the inside if it is exposed to the air. If this doesn`t happen moisture from the air will be absorbed by the paper over time and will lead to mold issues and that distinctive odor of souring paste. 
Important Pointers and Tips While paper-mâché is a very fun, simple and easy art form it also requires close attention to detail to avoid problems. The most common issues or problems that may develop can be prevented by following these simple tips and techniques.  
Use correctly sized paper strips The heavier the paper the thinner the strips have to be to allow the paper to smoothly go around corners. If you are trying to make a multi-sided shapes you may have to use different widths and lengths of strips for specific details and areas. Working with shorter strips rather than strips that are long ensures that you can quickly get the strips from the paste to the project and not have to deal with long ribbons of pasty paper.  
Use the correct size and type of frame The frame is like the foundation for the paper-mâché project. A frame that falls apart or doesn`t hold up to being moved or handled is going to make your art work much more challenging. The frame should be carefully washed with soap and water to remove any oil or substances that may repel the paper-mâché paste or the paper itself. This is true for plastic, metal or rubberized types of frame materials. Styrofoam or other types of lightweight material typically don`t have this problem and allow you to have a solid base to work from. Remember that paper-mâché is only the covering and it cannot create shapes on its own, it needs a structurally solid frame at least until it dries. 

While many people start with a balloon, this is actually a rather difficult frame to work with. The first reasons is because of the round shape and the second is that the first layer of paper-mâché doesn`t seem to want to adhere to the surface. If you are working with balloon, especially if you have kids, consider blowing up the balloon and coating with a layer of the paper-mâché paste and allowing to dry. This only takes an hour or two but it does help the paper strips adhere to the surface and prevents the frustration of everything sliding around on the surface.  
One layer at a time One of the biggest mistakes that people make is applying too many layers of paper-mâché at one time. Not only does this cause problems in drying but the weight of the layers may actually cause the shape to be distorted or pulled down as drying occurs. Most paper-mâché projects only need four layers of paper with very little overlap on the seams. Really heavy and thick layers may be important for large projects but they also require additional frame support and lots of time to dry between layers.  
Drying time Each layer must be completely dry before the next layer is applied. If you live in an area that is humid you may have to dry the paper-mâché project in the oven, just turn it on warm and leave it for a few hours, checking frequently. Dry to the touch on the surface does not mean the entire layer is completely dry. It is best to wait at least 24 hours between layers in a dry climate or create a drying area in a humid one. If you do not provide enough drying time between layers it will mold and sour from the inside out.  
Thin layers of paint and finish Just like the paper-mâché itself, applying thin layers of paint and allowing time to dry between applications is essential. This also goes for the final sealing and finishing spray or paint. Avoid heavy coats of lacquer or sealant products but make sure that air is cut off from the paper-mâché itself to prevent absorption of water from the air. 

Try different finishing layers before adding your paint or lacquer for a completely different look. Paper can be soaked in the paste to form a pulp, then spread over the surface to create a natural fibrous or wood type texture. Yarn or wool can also be soaked in the paste and applied over the last layer or the second to last layer to give a raised aspect to different parts of the design. Believe it or not that lint from your dryer can also be mixed with a slight amount of paste to give a woolly and rough texture to any paper-mâché design. 
Conclusion Although most people think of paper-mâché as a kid`s art project, it really is a very versatile medium for all types of decorations and household objects. Since it is a traditional type of art form there is a wealth of information on the web about project options, how to pages and even videos showing different paper-mâché techniques. 

This very versatile art activity is great for the whole family to get involved in. Large or small decorations are also perfect for highly personalized gifts for family, friends and coworkers. The addition of different types of paints, lacquers and texturizing applications can make a paper-mâché design look like a wide variety of surfaces and art forms. 

Since paper-mâché also uses all natural and recyclable items, this is a very green type of art and perfect for those that are environmentally conscious. The next time you recycle, just save those old newspapers and plan to create something lovely for your home.",
